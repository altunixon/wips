All the dialogue is getting increasingly annoying ;_; (Not the names, just them talking in general.)<br/>
Chapter 81<br/>
Class Up<br/>
When we arrived at the Hourglass of the Dragon’s Era that sister at the reception desk before was gone.<br/>
Naofumi:"Where did that other sister go to?"<br/>
Sister:"She was arrested because she was part of the Three Heroes Church."<br/>
Oh, so she was labeled a criminal.<br/>
Well she was infuriating anyway. Too bad.<br/>
Naofumi:"Now what? Can we go Class Up?"<br/>
Queen:"First of all, please tell me who wants to do a class up."<br/>
After listening to the queen I look at Raphtalia and Firo.<br/>
Though we have already decided which Class to take, there is no telling what might happen.<br/>
Firo:"Okay~! Firo wants to go first!"<br/>
Firo raises her hand and declares that she wants to go first.<br/>
I look at Raphtalia and she nods.<br/>
Raphtalia:"Then Firo will Class Up first."<br/>
Firo:"Yay~!"<br/>
Melty:"Firo-chan do your best!"<br/>
In her human form Firo steps forward with a pitter-patter.<br/>
Sister:"Please get into a comfortable position,touch the Hourglass of Dragon’s Era and focus your consciousness on it."<br/>
Firo:"Like this?"<br/>
Firo reverts to her demon form and slowly touches the Hourglass of Dragon’s Era.<br/>
The sand near Firo’s wing shines and ripples.<br/>
Queen:"Now then, let’s proceed with the Class Up ceremony."<br/>
On the queen’s orders the soldiers surrounding the hourglass pour some kind of liquid into the grooves the shape of a magic square etched into the floor.<br/>
Firo:"Huh?What is that sound?"<br/>
Firo strains her ears.<br/>
Queen:"Concentrate"<br/>
Firo:"Okay~"<br/>
Firo shuts her eyes and spreads both her wings.<br/>
The hourglass continues to glow, and the magic formation on the floor also starts glowing.<br/>
Firo stands in the center, and is being surrounded by light.<br/>
Queen:" Now, please choose your future possibility."<br/>
Firo:"Ah, Something popped up"<br/>
Firo mutters with her eyes closed.<br/>
The icon in Firo’s view also appears in mine, a class tree appeared.<br/>
Queen:"Since she is Iwatani-sama’s demon, you must choose."<br/>
Naofumi:"Ah, is such a thing even possible?"<br/>
All the possibilities of Philorials and their various abilities appear.<br/>
However.<br/>
Naofumi:"What Firo wants for herself, may not be what I choose."<br/>
If I don’t choose, does it automatically pick the demon’s choice?<br/>
I press the decline button on the screen.<br/>
Firo:"Wa! something came into view!"<br/>
It was probably what appeared in front of me earlier. It might be due to the influence of the demon crest.<br/>
Firo:"Which one to pick~……"<br/>
With her eyes closed Firo happily picks her possibility.<br/>
I’ll allow Firo to decided for herself, since this will affect her whole life.<br/>
That’s right. I’ll tell Raphtalia the same.<br/>
Naofumi:" Raphtalia, I will let you and Firo choose whichever Class Up you want yourselves, since I will be leaving the world after the wave is over. It will be fine."<br/>
Raphtalia:"As long as Naofumi-sama chooses, it will be good……."<br/>
Naofumi:"Nope."<br/>
Raphtalia:"……I understand."<br/>
Raphtalia mutters while seeming dissatisfied about something.<br/>
If I decide selfishly and they don’t like it, then it would be rough for both of us.<br/>
I want them to choose for themselves, because I trust them.<br/>
Now then, I wonder what Firo is going to choose.<br/>
Firo’s ahoge is growing and shining brilliantly.<br/>
Naofumi:"Eh?"<br/>
The light shines brighter and buzzes, and then with a flash it was gone.<br/>
I was momentarily blinded.<br/>
When my vision recovers, I look at Firo who is blinking repeatedly. Her appearence……There are no big changes.<br/>
But, her ahoge has become more luxurious, now it gives off the feeling of a mini-crown…….<br/>
Queen:"It seems the Class Up was completed successfully."<br/>
Naofumi:" I see."<br/>
I check her status. The ★ has disappeared wonderfully.<br/>
Her stats have nearly doubled.<br/>
Isn’t this too amazing?<br/>
Melty:"Firo-chan is amazing!"<br/>
It seems Metly is pleased that Firo has powered up.<br/>
However, Firo has a delicate expression while walking over.<br/>
Firo:"You see……Firo wasn’t able to choose……"<br/>
Fire mutters, looking like she is about to cry at any moment.<br/>
Naofumi:"What went wrong?"<br/>
Firo:"Firo wanted to choose the one that can spit poison. But what came out was not what was selected."<br/>
Naofumi:" I saw your ahoge shine brightly."<br/>
Firo:"Mu……"<br/>
Melty is coaxing the depressed Firo.<br/>
Naofumi:"Then, next is Raphtalia."<br/>
Raphtalia:"O-Okay."<br/>
Before it even starts I’m getting a bad feeling about this.<br/>
Raphtalia touches the Hourglass the same way Firo did.<br/>
When the light shines, the soldiers pour the same liquid inside the magic formation.<br/>
As I thought, an icon pops up in my view again.<br/>
Now then……pushing the refusal—<br/>
At that moment, Firo’s ahoge splits in two and one enters my view.<br/>
<br/>
Naofumi:"Wha!?What is this!? You bird!"<br/>
Firo:" It’s not Firo!"<br/>
Not Firo you say!? Are you telling me that your ahoge can act independently?<br/>
Raphtalia’s eyes open wide and she stares<br/>
Raphtalia:"Naofumi-sama!?"<br/>
The ahoge lands on the pop-up,disappears, and reveals a possibility that didn’t exist before.<br/>
Light flows from me to Raphtalia.<br/>
Raphtalia:"Kya!?"<br/>
Raphtalia screams.<br/>
And the light disappears.<br/>
Thick smoke covers the room. This is quite different from Firo’s.<br/>
The smoke clears up……<br/>
I watch Raphtalia coughing. There are no apparent changes other than her hair colour being a brighter shade compared to before……<br/>
Naofumi:"A-Are you alright?"<br/>
Raphtalia:"Oh, uh yeah. I’m fine……"<br/>
What happened?I worryingly check Raphtalia’s status.<br/>
……Just like Firo, the ★ dissapeared and her stats have nearly doubled.<br/>
Raphtalia:"What happened?"<br/>
Naofumi:"I have no idea either. The Class Up was chosen by itself……I had a bad feeling, but there seems to be no problems."<br/>
Queen:"I see, that’s fine then…… I wonder what chose the Class Up without permission?<br/>
Naofumi:"What are you talking about?"<br/>
Melty:" Uhmm you see. I think Firo-chan’s ahoge did it-"<br/>
Melty retells her story about meeting the Philorial Queen.<br/>
Queen:"I see, I would have liked to meet the queen of Philorials too."<br/>
Naofumi:"That’s not the problem right now."<br/>
Is the queen’s hobby searching for legends?<br/>
Wait wait, this isn’t the situation to think about those things.<br/>
Naofumi:"I wonder why. I was uneasy and thought that there might be some abnormal transformations!"<br/>
Raphtalia:"Yes, me too. Though I had a feeling my body was shrinking, but that doesn’t seem to be the case."<br/>
Firo:"Master~, what are you saying?"<br/>
It seems something absurd in the world occurred……<br/>
At any rate, there is nothing we can do about it, and nothing bad happened.<br/>
Maybe it was due to my luck finally turning around.<br/>
Naofumi:"……Don’t worry about it. Anyway, how are your abilities and conditions?<br/>
Raphtalia:"I feel that power is surging through my body."<br/>
Naofumi:"I see, that’s good……"<br/>
Queen:"Is it due to the Queen Philorial feather?…… I don’t know what it was, but it seems to have chosen for you. I’m sure that you will be unable to change it."<br/>
The queen regretfully informs us.<br/>
Queen:"There are specific items that you can use during Class Ups to get more benefits. I pray that was a good thing……"<br/>
Naofumi:"Yeah……"<br/>
Queen:"So how much did their abilities grow?"<br/>
Naofumi:"Their abilities almost doubled."<br/>
Queen:"Doubled!?"<br/>
The queen is surprised.<br/>
Perhaps this is way better than usual?<br/>
Maybe it’s due to the Philorial Queen’s feather. If the growth rate is high, then I am glad.<br/>
Queen:"Originally……any item that would increase the growth rate by 1.5 times is already amazing. They would generally be very strong."<br/>
Naofumi:"Is that so? Then this is great."<br/>
However, both of them have a delicate expression.<br/>
I understand your feelings.<br/>
Class Up—-I am familiar with that since in games you should be able to choose your own.<br/>
Naofumi:"Well…..Do your best."<br/>
Raphtalia:"uuu……somehow I’m feeling quite melancholic."<br/>
Firo:"Firo too."<br/>
Melty:"Cheer up, Firo-chan."<br/>
Like this, our Class Up was complete.<br/>
Queen:"Next is the contract."<br/>
The queen shows a contract written on parchment to me.<br/>
Queen:"Please read it."<br/>
Naofumi:"Sure……"<br/>
The contract contains the following:<br/>
1. If any situation occurs that would harm the Hero of the Shield, the country will stop it at all costs<br/>
2. The country will co-operate and arrange preparations for the Hero of the Shield against the wave.<br/>
3. The Hero of the Shield will receive various preferential treatments.<br/>
4. Nothing is demanded of the Hero of the Shield except for fighting against the wave.<br/>
Lastly, the country will take responsibility when the contract breaks.<br/>
I request for a copy of the contractual document……For insurance. So a copy of the parchment was given to me.<br/>
The contents are very advantageous for me.<br/>
I confirm many times that there are no play on words or contradictory terms.<br/>
I feel that I may have went too far, but after inspecting it for a while there were no abnormalities.<br/>
Naofumi:"Well, this should be fine."<br/>
Queen:" Then, please finish the seal with a drop of your blood."<br/>
I poke my own finger with a knife and write my name in blood on the parchment.<br/>
The queen does the same, and the parchment begins to shine in the middle of the magic formation.<br/>
The light disappears and a golden bracelet appears around the queen’s arm.<br/>
Queen:"If the contract is broken, then it will punish me accordingly. Please rest assured."<br/>
Naofumi:" Understood. So I guess it’s official now?"<br/>
Queen:"Indeed."<br/>
There is a feeling of relief……<br/>
Naofumi:"I should reconsider exchanging companions on the trip……."<br/>
Queen:"Please consider carefully."<br/>
Seeing as I am having trouble deciding, the queen answers.<br/>
Naofumi:"Hm?"<br/>
Queen:"If it goes well wouldn’t Iwatani-sama be able to increase his companions?"<br/>
Naofumi:"Ah……So that’s what you mean."<br/>
This could be a chance for all the heroes, including me, to find out how the other hero companions operate.<br/>
Queen:"The Hero of the Shield is already not associated with anything evil. There may even be some companions that are dissatisfied with following their chosen hero."<br/>
Naofumi:"In other words…… a repicking from the first day……"<br/>
I am still holding a grudge from when no one helped me.<br/>
There is also no way I will lose Raphtalia and Firo thanks to them being slaves.<br/>
Queen:"Even if Iwatani-sama is not aware, some of the hero companions have already been changed. So, it might not be a bad idea to try it out."<br/>
Naofumi:"Change? Who went to who?"<br/>
Queen:"Every Hero-sama. More or less, compared to before their party is a little different……"<br/>
Since I never took a good look, I did not notice it.<br/>
What can I say? The companions of those fellows must have sobered up.<br/>
Their true colours must have shown.<br/>
……That reminds me, that man in Motoyasu’s party disappeared.<br/>
I thought he was just hiding and waiting for a chance, but he did not appear at all.<br/>
Well, as a man in Motoyasu’s harem it was probably hell for him.<br/>
Besides, I feel that each Hero had an increase in companions.<br/>
Definitely. There are people who become friends in the middle of a trip.<br/>
If an adventurer, villager, knight, or magician has talent then they would be scouted.<br/>
It’s a common development that happens in my favourite mangas and light novels.<br/>
I see. I am the unorthodox one, only taking slaves.<br/>
Anyhow……<br/>
Naofumi:……haah. I understand."<br/>
Queen:"There may be someone who wants to follow Iwatani-sama."<br/>
Naofumi:"But I do not trust anyone except for those with absolute obedience."<br/>
Queen:"Oh ho? But I thought you are developing a good relationship with Melty?"<br/>
At the queen’s words, Melty trembles and blushes a deep-red.<br/>
It is probably from being humiliated.<br/>
Naofumi:"She’s going to die if she didn’t follow me, so there’s no other way. She might be Firo’s good friend, but she doesn’t respect me at all"<br/>
Melty:"R-Right!"<br/>
She nods energetically. As I thought, Melty disliked me after all.<br/>
Queen:"It doesn’t seem so though."<br/>
Melty:"Mother!"<br/>
The queen laughs and shows a heart-warming smile.<br/>
Did I say something funny?<br/>
Raphtalia:"Mu……"<br/>
I look over at Raphtalia and she seems to be sulking.<br/>
Naofumi:"What’s wrong?"<br/>
Raphtalia:"Absolutely nothing!"<br/>
Firo:"Hm~?"<br/>
I tilt my head together with Firo.<br/>
Queen:"Isn’t this fine? We have finished our business here, you should depart soon."<br/>
After leaving the building of the Hourglass of the Dragon’s Era, we depart for the Island.<br/>
Queen:"Please look forward to your various rewards when you return."<br/>
Naofumi:"Rewards? What is it?"<br/>
Queen:" Iwatani-sama I heard you wanted to learn magic, so I will prepare magic books and crystal balls."<br/>
Ah, so it’s something like that.<br/>
Mhmm……Besides, if I do get another companion then I will need supplies.<br/>
Queen:"Crystal balls let you acquire magic quickly, but there is a lack of power. Whereas for books, it takes a lot longer to learn, but it is much stronger."<br/>
Naofumi:"So there was such an effect……"<br/>
When I read the magic book, it was explaining the basics of basics.<br/>
Besides, in the book it also explains how to adjust power, and other ways to tweak the spells.<br/>
Of course, in order to learn these things it will take time.<br/>
This is not a game, and time is limited. But, I should also avoid learning too much from the crystal balls since it’s efficiency will be bad.<br/>
Judging from the other heroes actions, I am currently the only one that can read this world’s letters.<br/>
It may be important to make use of this advantage.<br/>
Queen:" Will crystal balls be alright Iwatani-sama?"<br/>
Naofumi:"I can read a little of this world’s letters, so…… If there is someone to teach me properly, and a book, it would be fine."<br/>
Queen:"I see. I’ll arrange it."<br/>
Naofumi:"Also, can equipment be procured?"<br/>
Queen"It is possible to give you weapons from the country’s arsenal but……"<br/>
That reminds me, I still haven’t visited the old man from the weapons shop yet.<br/>
It might also be good to see if there are any requests for materials from Cal Mira Island, perhaps it would be nice to get some materials myself.<br/>
Naofumi:"In the meantime, please prepare some degree of armour and weapons for us."<br/>
Queen:" Alright. Now then, I wish you a good day."<br/>
Melty:"Naofumi, Firo-chan, Raphtalia-san, Good luck! Have a nice day!"<br/>
We parted from the queen, got on the carriage, and hurried to the town where the ship to Cal Mira Island is.<br/>
<br/>
