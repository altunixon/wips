<br/>
"Hah!" <br/>
I –Sasaki Aya– woke up.<br/>
"Eh?" <br/>
I didn’t die?<br/>
I look at my own body.<br/>
There’s no big wound.<br/>
Even though I remember my body being torn apart.<br/>
I look around.<br/>
This is the space at the back of the waterfall that I like.<br/>
The one that’s right at the exit of the lair.<br/>
"Mother-sama! Everyone!" <br/>
I ran to the lair.<br/>
That was a dream! Everyone is alive!<br/>
That must be the case! <br/>
The familiar big rock that protects the entrance of the lair was destroyed from the inside.<br/>
The inside that was normally so lively was now dead silent and there’s no one.<br/>
"Cold…" <br/>
It is not the usual home.<br/>
It is the same as that nightmare.<br/>
It wasn’t a dream…<br/>
"Uh…uh…wuuu…" <br/>
Tears overflow.<br/>
The last moments of everyone were burned in my eyes.<br/>
Those hollow eyes.<br/>
The bloodied Mother-sama.<br/>
Why…did something like that…<br/>
The lair of the Lamias had a spell cast that only allowed Lamias to enter.<br/>
That’s why it is impossible for enemies to enter —unless someone betrays them.<br/>
Elder Sister-sama —no, that Bitch.<br/>
My siblings, Mother-sama, my older sisters…<br/>
I don’t know why, but I am alive.<br/>
Then, I will crush the enemy.<br/>
I must not die until then.<br/>
…<br/>
After that, I hunted monsters. Hunted, hunted, hunted, hunted, and continued hunting.<br/>
Especially harpies.<br/>
I was crushing them completely wondering if that boss might come out, but when they fly away, it is hard to catch them.<br/>
They have begun to run away the moment they see me.<br/>
Damn it!<br/>
The place I sleep in is the Lamia lair where there’s no one.<br/>
The door has been destroyed, so it isn’t as safe as before, but I don’t know any other place.<br/>
I thought that maybe the traitor would come back, but she didn’t show herself.<br/>
Where did she go?<br/>
Maybe she bit the dust somewhere.<br/>
But in the off-chance that she is alive…<br/>
I will kill her.<br/>
Killing that traitor and the boss of the harpies is my reason for living.<br/>
But I am not that strong.<br/>
Now that I think about it, Mother-sama has said this: "If you want to become stronger, eat humans. They hold strong powers blessed by the Gods. If you eat a human with high mana, you can become stronger. Just like me."<br/>
The current me cannot defeat the boss of the harpies.<br/>
I have to become stronger…<br/>
I can’t go choosing my methods.<br/>
◇◇<br/>
I continued fighting all alone for a while.<br/>
One day…<br/>
I noticed that a big sound was made from the underground lake.<br/>
I hurriedly jumped out from my lair. <br/>
I thought that maybe an enemy attacked, but it seems like that wasn’t the case.<br/>
The monsters are gathering.<br/>
That’s…humans?<br/>
Are those the so called adventurers that the older sisters were talking about?<br/>
There’s two humans.<br/>
A bright red haired girl, and a black haired boy with gray attire.<br/>
The girl must be a mage, she has a staff after all.<br/>
What’s the man? Lightweight armor, and a dagger.<br/>
A thief, maybe?<br/>
Mana is overflowing from the female mage.<br/>
I can feel a powerful lifeforce.<br/>
(If I attack her…if I eat her, maybe I can become stronger?) <br/>
But before that, there’s the hated harpies.<br/>
I will deal with those first! <br/>
I observe those two while crushing the harpies.<br/>
If I had to compare, the overwhelmingly stronger one should be the mage woman.<br/>
The man has lifeforce comparable to that of the goblins around here.<br/>
That’s what I thought at first.<br/>
But…<br/>
(No… The problematic one is the man.) <br/>
They were surrounded by several tens of monsters. <br/>
The female mage is desperately chanting magic, and trying to evade the sea serpent and the strings of the arachnes while raising screams.<br/>
On the other hand, the man holding a dagger…<br/>
(Does he have eyes on his back?) <br/>
He was avoiding the attacks of the harpies that were coming from the back with minimal movements.<br/>
Nimbly escaping from the sea serpent that jumps out from the water.<br/>
Cutting the arachne webs deftly.<br/>
Even though he doesn’t look like he has much physical strength, he was dealing with all the attacks carefreely as if he were dancing.<br/>
(Moreover, what’s with that calmness of his?) <br/>
Even though he was fighting for his life here, avoiding the attacks of the monsters by a paper-thin difference, he scratched his cheek.<br/>
It is as if he is saying ‘good grief, this is troubling’.<br/>
(The problematic one is that black haired man… Let’s hunt him first.) <br/>
I raised my concentration.<br/>
Even so, that gesture of scratching his cheek…<br/>
I feel like I have seen it before, but I can’t remember.<br/>
◇◇<br/>
– Makoto POV –<br/>
"Damn it, they are not decreasing in numbers." (Makoto)<br/>
"[Falling Meteor]!" (Lucy)<br/>
The spell that Lucy shot raised a gigantic water splash.<br/>
This is already the 7th spell shot.<br/>
It got several monsters, but there’s still a lot.<br/>
"Are you okay, Lucy?" (Makoto)<br/>
"Yeah, I am still okay in mana." (Lucy)<br/>
As bottomless as ever, Monarch Mage.<br/>
But her concentration is already at its limit.<br/>
"Lucy, don’t use magic for a while. I will continue evading." (Makoto)<br/>
"U-Understood…" (Lucy)<br/>
Lucy was swaying as she wrapped her arm around my waist. <br/>
I look around.<br/>
There’s more than 50 monsters surrounding us.<br/>
Most of the monsters are low or mid class. <br/>
There’s 2 that I have to be careful about.<br/>
One of them is the giant crocodile-looking monster.<br/>
King Crocodile.<br/>
There was information about it in the guild.<br/>
It is apparently the ruler of the underground lake.<br/>
Just that, it seems like it isn’t interested in us right now, and is attacking orcs and goblins. <br/>
That’s why I am not worried about it. <br/>
The problem is the other one.<br/>
By the time I noticed, it was already mixed in the free-for-all fight, a single lamia.<br/>
(I heard that Lamias normally act in groups though…) <br/>
This Lamia is acting alone. <br/>
At a glance, it looks like it is fighting the harpies and arachnes and has no interest over here, but…<br/>
(She is aiming at us…) (Makoto)<br/>
The Detection Skill’s alert has been ringing for a while now.<br/>
(Moreover, she is crazy strong.) (Makoto)<br/>
Lamias are Mid Class.<br/>
But this one is crushing orcs with one hit, and ripping apart the wings of harpies as if they were paper.<br/>
Or more like, the harpies ran away when they saw that Lamia.<br/>
On that point alone, we are lucky, but that one Lamia is a lot more worrying…<br/>
It has been 10 minutes since the time I used the Spirit Magic.<br/>
I want to use a big spell and deal with the monsters, but…<br/>
(In a situation where that Lamia is aiming at us, I don’t want to use magic.)<br/>
It would create an opening.<br/>
I want to distract her if possible.<br/>
"Lucy." (Makoto)<br/>
"Haah, haaah… What?" (Lucy)<br/>
"No, it is nothing." (Makoto)<br/>
I was going to tell her to be careful about that Lamia, but it doesn’t seem like she has the leeway.<br/>
I will deal with it.<br/>
I purposely have my back face the Lamia.<br/>
I have a 360° view, so it is not like I am letting the Lamia out of my sight.<br/>
(Will she take the bait?) (Makoto)<br/>
I avoided the attacks of the surrounding monsters with my back still directed at the Lamia for a while.<br/>
I wait for that moment with a dagger in hand.<br/>
(Here it comes!) (Makoto)<br/>
The Lamia lunges at us, closing the distance.<br/>
(Fast!) (Makoto)<br/>
I swing my dagger the moment I turn around, but it painfully cuts air.<br/>
[Water Magic: Ice Needle]!<br/>
I cast my real intention, the blinding spell.<br/>
Ice needles were created right at the face of the Lamia, and shot.<br/>
(She avoided it?!) (Makoto)<br/>
This is the first time this spell has been avoided.<br/>
"Damn it!" (Makoto)<br/>
This is a bit bad.<br/>
I am a total mess at close combat. <br/>
The eyes of the Lamia and I meet in close distance.<br/>
(What a beautiful monster.) (Makoto)<br/>
While holding an out-of-place impression, I readjust my posture to protect Lucy.<br/>
But it isn’t attacking at all.<br/>
The monster in front of me had her eyes wide open as if it were surprised.<br/>
"Takatsuki-kun…?" <br/>
