<br/>
Its body is covered in muddy lava, and its surface, there’s a large amount of bones and skulls floating.<br/>
That blasphemous figure of his would make the people seeing it falter…<br/>
"Taboo Giant…" <br/>
Right, that roar and the creepy appearance is similar to that of the Taboo Dragon.<br/>
No, that’s not important right now.<br/>
We have to defeat it, or the city will be turned into a mess.<br/>
"Lucy, Sa-san! …Eh?" (Makoto)<br/>
I looked around…and was stunned.<br/>
"Kaaaaaaaaaaaaaaah!" <br/>
The unpleasant roar of the Giant resonates.<br/>
The knights, the adventurers, and Lucy had a pale blue expression with their knees on the ground.<br/>
"Lucy?!" (Makoto)<br/>
I run to Lucy who is trembling heavily.<br/>
"I-I am…okay…" (Lucy)<br/>
"There’s no way you are!" (Makoto)<br/>
I hold her trembling shoulders.<br/>
What? What did it do?<br/>
"The voice of a Taboo Monster has a curse that can instill fear…" <br/>
When I turned around, there was Princess Sofia standing with a pale face.<br/>
Does she have a resistance towards abnormal status effects? She isn’t down on her knees like the others.<br/>
Even so, she still looks like she is in pain.<br/>
"Sa-san, are you okay?" (Makoto)<br/>
"Yeah, it looks like I am fine." (Aya)<br/>
Sa-san being a Lamia might have weakened the effect.<br/>
"Are you okay, Makoto-san?" (Leonard)<br/>
Prince Leonard seems to be okay too.<br/>
Well, Sakurai-kun was okay with the Divine Protection of the Goddess. <br/>
Heroes are cheats, so I don’t have to worry.<br/>
"I have a Skill called [Clear Mind]." (Makoto)<br/>
"…Even if that’s the case, you are completely fine?" (Sofia)<br/>
Princess Sofia asked in surprise.<br/>
This is my second rodeo with a Taboo Monster after all.<br/>
"I will defeat it!" (Leonard)<br/>
Prince Leonard takes a stance with his sword shining blue.<br/>
Is that a magic sword?<br/>
It is most likely a legendary weapon passed down by the royal family.<br/>
"Leo…" (Sofia)<br/>
The usually cold Princess Sofia had a worried expression.<br/>
"[Ice Sword]!" (Leonard)<br/>
Prince Leonard swung his sword, and a giant magic blade attacked the Giant.<br/>
Ooh! Wow!<br/>
It is ten times bigger than the sword magic of Jean.<br/>
A big wound was dealt onto the Giant.<br/>
But…<br/>
"It is regenerating." (Aya)<br/>
Just as Sa-san said, the wound was healing as soon as it hit. <br/>
I can’t tell if we actually dealt any damage at all from just looking at his appearance.<br/>
The arm of the Giant was swung at the prince with a powerful sound of the wind hitting its arm, and the prince hurriedly took distance.<br/>
That was slightly dangerous.<br/>
"Leo!" (Sofia)<br/>
"Kuh!" (Leonard)<br/>
He once again swung his sword, but the result was the same.<br/>
Does Prince Leonard not have a big move like Sakurai-kun?<br/>
When I glanced at my side, I could see Princess Sofia with a worried expression.<br/>
Hmm, doesn’t she have a hidden trump card or something?<br/>
Huh?<br/>
Honestly, I had not been feeling any urgency in my heart for a while now. <br/>
Maybe because I saw Sakurai-kun defeat the Taboo Dragon in one hit?<br/>
Heroes are overwhelming powerhouses in this world.<br/>
I assumed that Prince Leonard was the same.<br/>
(Makoto, the Light Hero is special. Leonard-kun is the weakest among the Heroes though…) (Noah)<br/>
Noah-sama gives me her comment.<br/>
Oh…so that’s how it is.<br/>
I once again look around with Lucy in my arms.<br/>
The knights and adventurers were in fear from the voice of the Taboo Giant.<br/>
Sa-san can move, but because of the Giant being covered in lava completely, she can’t hit him with her bare hands.<br/>
Her arms would most likely be done for if she did.<br/>
The attacks of our trump card that is the Glacial Hero, Prince Leonard, don’t have much effect.<br/>
…Aren’t we in a pinch here?<br/>
The fist of the Giant that is accompanied by the fearsome sound of buffeting wind was unleashed towards the Prince.<br/>
This is bad! He can’t avoid that one!<br/>
"Prince!" <br/>
The knight old man pushed Prince Leonard out of the way and ended up taking the hit for him.<br/>
He was on his knees, and yet, he managed to move out of sheer force of will?! <br/>
The old man took the fist of the Giant face on, and as if he had been hit by a truck, he was sent spinning onto a wall, breaking right through the wall and disappearing inside it.<br/>
"Old man!" (Makoto)<br/>
That was…he is dead…<br/>
There’s no way he survived that.<br/>
Damn it!<br/>
I grinded my teeth, but I have to cut that off my head for now.<br/>
Calm down.<br/>
[Clear Mind] 99%.<br/>
Don’t lose your composure.<br/>
"Waaaaaaaaaaaaah!!" <br/>
Maybe because his ally had been killed, Prince Leonard lost his composure and his movements became rustic.<br/>
Does he not have a Skill to stabilize his mind?<br/>
"Hey…I apparently can die 4 times so, should I try pulling a do-or-die attack?" (Aya)<br/>
Sa-san proposes this.<br/>
"…No. I don’t think bare handed attacks will work against a Giant that is covered in lava." (Makoto)<br/>
Moreover, a charge with dying in mind, as if I will allow that.<br/>
The Giant seems to be slowly getting used to the attacks of Prince Leonard, it switches into offense.<br/>
Each time the Giant moves, lava is scattered around, and changes the surroundings into fire footing.<br/>
Prince Leonard is slowly losing space to retreat to.<br/>
At this rate, it is a matter of time before he gets caught.<br/>
"Sa-san, assist Prince Leonard! Use rocks, rubble, or whatever, just throw it and take its attention away! However, don’t approach it too much. Don’t let it catch you by any means!" (Makoto)<br/>
"O-Okay. I will try." (Aya)<br/>
Sorry, for asking you such a dangerous thing!<br/>
I suddenly feel a gaze on me, and notice that Princess Sofia is looking here.<br/>
"Takatsuki Makoto…can you do something…?" (Sofia)<br/>
"Princess Sofia…" (Makoto)<br/>
Princess Sofia speaks to me with a desperate face as if praying.<br/>
[Will you heed the request of Princess Sofia?]<br/>
Yes ←<br/>
No<br/>
I personally want to say yes, but…<br/>
But, how?<br/>
Think.<br/>
There should be…something.<br/>
Is there a hint?<br/>
An item that can overturn this situation?<br/>
Won’t an assist character appear?<br/>
If this were Makkaren or Laberintos, I could use Spirit Magic…<br/>
(Makoto…Use Princess Sofia.) (Noah)<br/>
Eh?<br/>
Goddess-sama?<br/>
Use?<br/>
What are you saying?<br/>
Use her… Could that mean…<br/>
"Princess Sofia! Do you have a Magic Skill?" (Makoto)<br/>
"I haven’t done training as a mage, but…I do have the Ice Magic Monarch Skill. But I can only use it to protect myself…" (Sofia)<br/>
Plenty enough.<br/>
I grabbed the hand of Sofia without hesitation.<br/>
"What are you doing?!" (Sofia)<br/>
"Apologies, I will be borrowing your mana." (Makoto)<br/>
Synchronization.<br/>
At that moment, I had a hallucination as if I was inside a freezing blizzard.<br/>
A cold and refreshing mana began to pour massively inside of me.<br/>
"Hngh!" (Sofia)<br/>
Princess Sofia let out a low moan.<br/>
"Sa-san! Prince Leonard! Step back!" (Makoto)<br/>
"Got it!" (Aya)<br/>
My voice didn’t seem to have reached Prince Leonard, but Sa-san carried the Prince and moved away.<br/>
"Water Magic: [Water Dragon]!" (Makoto)<br/>
The Ice Dragon that came out from my hand flies towards the Taboo Giant.<br/>
Eh? The Water Dragon turned into an Ice Dragon?<br/>
Is this because of Princess Sofia’s Monarch Ice Magic?<br/>
"Kaaaaaaaaaaaa…aa…aaa…" <br/>
The attack didn’t reach at all, but parts here and there of the Giant’s body were frozen.<br/>
The movements of the Giant dulled slightly.<br/>
Oh, looks like this is effective.<br/>
No, it is not.<br/>
The Ice Dragon was torn apart by the Giant.<br/>
"Ta-Takatsuki Makoto…what in the world was that?" (Sofia)<br/>
"I casted magic by synchronizing with you, Princess Sofia… Was it painful?" (Makoto)<br/>
"N-No…it was just a bit sudde—" (Sofia)<br/>
"Then, I will go for the next." (Makoto)<br/>
"Eh?" (Sofia)<br/>
I got the permission of the Princess, so I increased the potency of the synchronization.<br/>
Even more mana began to flow into me.<br/>
"Hau!" (Sofia)<br/>
Princess Sofia quivered and she arched back.<br/>
Did I take too much mana at once?<br/>
"Water Magic: Dance, [Dual Ice Dragon]." (Makoto)<br/>
This time I use two Ice Dragons to attack the Giant.<br/>
They sink their teeth into the Giant as if trying to devour it.<br/>
It seems like it is damaging it to a certain extent, but…<br/>
As expected, they were crushed by the Giant in the end.<br/>
"Hmm, Superior Rank Magic is lacking in dealing a decisive hit." (Makoto)<br/>
"…Haaah…Haah…Haah…" (Sofia)<br/>
Princess Sofia’s breathing is ragged.<br/>
It might be bad to keep the synchronization for too long.<br/>
"U-Uhm…my body is…feeling hot…" (Sofia)<br/>
Princess Sofia complains.<br/>
"Is it painful? Does it hurt somewhere?" (Makoto)<br/>
"N-No…it doesn’t hurt, but…" (Sofia)<br/>
"I will finish it with the next one. I am going full power." (Makoto)<br/>
"Eh? Wasn’t the one of before full power alread—" (Sofia)<br/>
Full Synchro.<br/>
With the feeling of becoming one with the other party, I enter deep, really deep into Princess Sofia…<br/>
"Hngh! Aaaan!" (Sofia)<br/>
She is letting out a painful sounding voice every time though…<br/>
Does it really not hurt?<br/>
But thanks to that, a gigantic amount of mana flowed into me.<br/>
Moreover, it is different from the whimsical mana of the Spirits, it is easy to use.<br/>
I feel like I can do it with this.<br/>
"Water Magic: [Yamata no—" (Makoto)<br/>
No, wait. Is it okay to use Water Monarch Magic in the middle of the city?<br/>
It might drag the adventurers and knights into it.<br/>
Okay, let’s modify it!<br/>
"Water Magic: [Ice Phoenix]!" (Makoto)<br/>
The Phoenix is originally a Fire Monarch Spell.<br/>
I switched it into Water Magic.<br/>
(You are doing some crazy stuff there.) (Noah)<br/>
The Goddess retorted.<br/>
Hey, I am concentrating here, so shut up please.<br/>
But thank you very much for the hint of before!<br/>
(You’re welcome~.) (Noah)<br/>
The Monarch Magic is complete.<br/>
A giant Ice Phoenix appears in front of us.<br/>
Ooh! So cool!<br/>
"Go! Defeat the Taboo Giant!" (Makoto)<br/>
Letting out a shrill cry, it attacks the Giant.<br/>
"U-Uhm…is that Monarch Rank Magic?" (Sofia)<br/>
"It is thanks to Princess Sofia." (Makoto)<br/>
I smile at her.<br/>
Man, as expected of someone with a Monarch Magic Skill.<br/>
"O-Oh…Is that so." (Sofia)<br/>
"Looks like it will be able to defeat it soon enough. See?" (Makoto)<br/>
At the place where I pointed at, the Phoenix clawed onto the Giant. Its claws sinking onto its arm and releasing a windy frost that expanded. <br/>
The body of the Taboo Giant was slowly freezing.<br/>
Alright, time to finish it.<br/>
"Water Magic: [Ice Prison]!" (Makoto)<br/>
At the end, a giant ice sculpture was made.<br/>
The Giant was frozen into a slightly silly pose.<br/>
The Ice Phoenix perched on top of it.<br/>
It is quite the picturesque sight.<br/>
"…Was it defeated?" (Sofia)<br/>
Princess Sofia asks.<br/>
"I think it will stay frozen for 7 days. Please deal with it within that time frame." (Makoto)<br/>
In Makkaren where there’s a lot of Spirits, I could have frozen it for around 1 year.<br/>
It is impossible in Horun though.<br/>
"…Understood." (Sofia)<br/>
"Haah, what a relief." (Makoto)<br/>
Aah, that was rough.<br/>
"U-Uhm…" (Sofia)<br/>
"Thanks, Princess Sofia." (Makoto)<br/>
"R-Right… Uhm…your hand." (Sofia)<br/>
"Hm?" (Makoto)<br/>
Shoot! We were still holding hands.<br/>
"Excuse my rudeness." (Makoto)<br/>
I quickly let go of her hand.<br/>
Princess Sofia made a hard to describe face for a moment, and soon returned to her serious face.<br/>
"Everyone, listen! The Taboo Giant has been defeated. The ones who can move, search once again if there’s any monsters remaining, and have the citizens evacuate. Adventurers, if possible, I ask for your assistance too." (Sofia)<br/>
"Oracle-sama!" <br/>
The one who responded first was the former guardian knight.<br/>
Wait, eh?! <br/>
"Old man, you were alive?!" (Makoto)<br/>
After getting hit by the attack of that Giant?<br/>
I thought not even your shape remained though.<br/>
"Hahaha, against my [Impenetrable Defense, Superior Rank] Skill, that level of attack is as if I was bitten by a mosquito—Guh!" <br/>
That must have been a strong mosquito.<br/>
He ended up falling down on his knees.<br/>
"Are you okay?" (Makoto)<br/>
I ran up to him and tried to lend him a shoulder, but…<br/>
"No problem. More importantly, the knights that can move, we are heading to rescue the citizens. A few of you, escort the Oracle-sama and the Prince to the castle!" <br/>
""""""""Yes!""""""""<br/>
Looks like his subordinates also recovered.<br/>
These guys are incredible.<br/>
Even though they looked like they were dying just a few moments ago, are they going back to work?<br/>
This workplace might be a bit of a slavedriver one.<br/>
"Takatsuki Makoto." (Sofia)<br/>
Princess Sofia calls me with her back facing me.<br/>
At her side, there’s Prince Leonard who is being carried by a knight.<br/>
Looking at him like this, he really is a child.<br/>
I pity the heavy responsibility he has in being a Hero.<br/>
"Thank you very much for just now. I will reward you at a later time." (Sofia)<br/>
"No, I didn’t really do much…" (Makoto)<br/>
I got my magic from the Princess after all.<br/>
"Let’s go." (Sofia)<br/>
The Princess and the knights move in the direction of the castle.<br/>
Haah…I am glad we somehow made it out of this.<br/>
I look at where my comrades are.<br/>
The complexion of Lucy has gotten a lot better now. It seems she is okay.<br/>
Sa-san is…eh?<br/>
"Wuuuh…" (Aya)<br/>
Sa-san is pale blue and trembling! <br/>
Could it be the curse of the Taboo Giant?<br/>
"Cold~…It is cold~…Takatsuki-kun…" (Aya)<br/>
"Ah." (Makoto)<br/>
Shit! <br/>
Sa-san is a Lamia, and cold is her weakness! <br/>
A giant ice sculpture, and a giant ice bird.<br/>
Moreover, maybe because of the effects of the Monarch Magic, even snow is falling.<br/>
Measuring with my body, it is around -30 °C, maybe? <br/>
"Sa-san, put this on!" (Makoto)<br/>
"T-Thank you." (Aya)<br/>
I hurriedly put my jacket on her shoulders, but it doesn’t seem like it has much effect.<br/>
"Aya, are you okay?" (Lucy)<br/>
Lucy stumbles her way here.<br/>
Ah, right!<br/>
"Sa-san, come here. Lucy too." (Makoto)<br/>
I had the two of them get close, and stick Lucy to Sa-san.<br/>
"Hiya!" (Lucy)<br/>
"Waaah, Lucy-san, so warm." (Aya)<br/>
Lucy quivers, and Sa-san makes a face as if melting.<br/>
"W-What?" (Lucy)<br/>
"Sorry, Lucy. Sa-san has to warm her body. Stay like that for a while." (Makoto)<br/>
"Waah, Lucy-san heater." (Aya)<br/>
Sa-san’s bluish complexion was returning to normal. That’s a relief.<br/>
I am grateful for the high temperature of Lucy.<br/>
"Uuuh, cold. I get it… Aya, are you okay?" (Lucy)<br/>
"Yeah, it feels nice." (Aya)<br/>
"Wait, where are you touching?!" (Lucy)<br/>
"Is there anywhere hotter?" (Aya)<br/>
Sa-san was feeling up Lucy’s body.<br/>
Yup yup, looking at two cute girls cuddling warms my heart.<br/>
"Now then, let’s look for people that didn’t manage to escape while returning to the inn." (Makoto)<br/>
""Okay.""<br/>
We moved through the city carefully, and returned to the inn.<br/>
Haah, it was tiring this time around, Goddess-sama.<br/>
