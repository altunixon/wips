Hi, this is some coloured illustration for volume 1. Volume 2 is just being released today but i’ll put illustration for volume 2 later on.<br/>
From right Iori, Elfi, Luser, Dionis, Lucifina<br/>
From right Nyanmel, Misha, Merwin<br/>
*As you can see the katakana for Nyamel name actually Nyanmeru and if there is anyone that want me to Nyanmeru just post your comments.<br/>
Actually, there’s a lot of uncolored picture in the light novel and if you’re interested you may click here to buy the digital copy of the light novel.<br/>
