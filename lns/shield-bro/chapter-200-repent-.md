Chapter 200: Repent<br/>
After I thought the time was right, I went off and made breakfast.<br/>
Some slaves had already begun preparing it, so I worked with them to cook.<br/>
After that, we distribute food to the villagers.<br/>
By the way, the second thing that surprised me was that the amount of child slaves increased.<br/>
While I was away, it seems the Slave Dealer stopped by and dropped them off.<br/>
He left the materials needed to engrave the slave seal with Kiel and the others.<br/>
The village has reached a point where the slaves will train the new slaves without my direct involvement.<br/>
Apparently, I’m too soft, so the actual manager is Raphtalia, and to some extent, Kiel and the other slaves I brought over first.<br/>
The fact that I’m the leader hasn’t changed, but most of the training and tasks are done by the slaves themselves, so I don’t have to do much.<br/>
Perhaps because of this, the new slaves are too afraid to approach me.<br/>
That’s good. In a few days, they’ll get used to me, but it feels good when someone actually listens to my orders.<br/>
"Now then, the people in the castle should be awake. I’m going out for a bit. Anyone who wants to go to the castle, follow me." (Naofumi)<br/>
"Ah, Naofumi-sama." (Atlas)<br/>
Atlas raises her hand.<br/>
Ah, that’s right. It’s around the time when Atlas should be able to Class-Up.<br/>
But she’s only around level 50 now. It will take a while for her to reach 60.<br/>
"What is it? I’ll be back really soon." (Naofumi)<br/>
"Is that so?" (Atlas)<br/>
"Yeah, and Firo isn’t here, so I’m not taking anyone to Class-Up." (NAofumi)<br/>
"I see… That’s unfortunate." (Atlas)<br/>
It seems that Atlas wants to stick to me…<br/>
I’m fine with some forms of friendship, but having her climb into my bed is a bit much.<br/>
I’ve compromised and said she can sleep close to me.<br/>
For some reason… Her appearance hasn’t changed with her level.<br/>
I wonder when she’ll grow up.<br/>
From what I’ve seen, Firo and Gaelion haven’t had to drive her out of my bed yet.<br/>
She sleeps peacefully with Sadina.<br/>
After that, I step out of Gaelion’s territory and activate the Portal Shield.<br/>
… The Queen was out.<br/>
It seems that she left to resolve local affairs, and she’ll be back tomorrow.<br/>
But she has received Female Knight’s report, and has left behind some orders.<br/>
The Hero of the Sword’s punishment is currently on hold. We are to look after him until then.<br/>
There’s nothing I can really do about it. This country is full of trash.<br/>
Next is… This may be serious. The Shadow who was watching over Itsuki issued a troubling report.<br/>
They had lost sight of him.<br/>
I have a bad feeling about this… What should I do?<br/>
Right after we capture Ren, Itsuki disappears.<br/>
Problems pop up one after the other.<br/>
After that, I stopped by the Slave Dealer to hand over money, but I’ll omit that.<br/>
My money is beginning to pile up, but we are still shorthanded.<br/>
Perhaps I should buy any Demi-Human slaves as long as they’re cheap.<br/>
At the Weapon shop… Imya’s uncle was tending the store.<br/>
"Ah, Hero of the Shield." (Imya’s Uncle)<br/>
"Yo. How’ve you been?" (Naofumi)<br/>
"Oh, that man’s been in a good mood. He’s working hard." (Imya’s Uncle)<br/>
"How about you?" (Naofumi)<br/>
"I’ve been able to get back the skills I had before, and have begun working to improve my skills." (Imya’s Uncle)<br/>
"The store is currently open, right?" (Naofumi)<br/>
The store’s been exceptionally prosperous lately, and all of the shelves are currently empty.<br/>
"No matter how much stuff we make, it keeps disappearing. I’ve put a portion of my profits towards the villager’s equipment fees." (Imya’s Uncle)<br/>
"That’ll really help. Imya and you, and the rest of the skillful slaves. I’m causing a lot of trouble for you all." (Naofumi)<br/>
"What are you saying? You gave me a job I enjoy. I should be thanking you. I’m having fun experimenting with the overflowing materials from that mountain." (Imya’s Uncle)<br/>
So he’s making Spirit Turtle-based equipment.<br/>
I guess I should wait expectantly.<br/>
"Ah, right. Could you ask the old man to use this in the armor I ordered?" (Naofumi)<br/>
I take out the core I got from Gaelion and hand it to Imya’s uncle.<br/>
"What’s this?" (Imya’s Uncle)<br/>
"The core of a formerly rotting dragon." (Naofumi)<br/>
"I see, so this is it! It’s quite a pretty, red stone. It’s different from anything I’ve seen in the marketplace." (Imya’s Uncle)<br/>
As expected of a skillful race. He could see the difference in a second.<br/>
"I planned to have that integrated in my new armor. I stopped by to see if it was possible." (Naofumi)<br/>
"Understood. Even if it seems impossible, I’ll work to make it possible." (Imya’s Uncle)<br/>
"… I’ll leave it to you." (Naofumi)<br/>
It seems that the Old Man’s shop has gotten livelier.<br/>
After that, I return to the village.<br/>
Thank god for the Portal Shield. Movement has become ridiculously easy.<br/>
"And that’s how it is. Before we receive further orders, you’ll be on house arrest in this village." (Naofumi)<br/>
I tell Ren as such.<br/>
Female Knight is also in the room, watching us with her arms crossed.<br/>
Between me and Ren, I wonder who she is watching.<br/>
"… I see." (Ren)<br/>
Ren listens to me expressionlessly.<br/>
"For now, I’ll have you tell me Witch’s location." (Naofumi)<br/>
"… I apologize. I don’t know." (Ren)<br/>
"Cut the crap. Weren’t you a bandit under Witch’s orders?" (Naofumi)<br/>
"You’re wrong. The one who made me a bandit… was none other than myself." (Ren)<br/>
Ren starts speaking.<br/>
Apparently, the day Ren joined Witch, she said there was a person she had to meet. The two proceeded to a certain village.<br/>
It was quite close to where they teleported.<br/>
And there, Ren was introduced to a man.<br/>
He got the feeling they had met somewhere before, but he couldn’t remember where.<br/>
That man drew out a sword, and offered to spar with Ren.<br/>
"I see, so you want to train with me." (Ren)<br/>
Ren lightly exchanged blows with the man for a while… and then the man began exchanging words with Witch.<br/>
"Honestly… Expectation—-. With this—–" (Man)<br/>
"So— is what it’ll be…" (Witch)<br/>
"But, won’t that—–" (Man)<br/>
"Right—- Stubborn, and hard—– advantage of." (Witch)<br/>
The two stared at him, making him feel nervous. But the Witch he trusted in was smiling, so he thought nothing of it.<br/>
"Now then, Ren-sama. You’re tired, rigt? Let’s go rest at the inn." (Witch)<br/>
And Witch dragged Ren off to an expensive looking inn.<br/>
"Truly, we look forward to travelling with Ren-sama." (Witch)<br/>
"Yeah! Ren-sama is much better than the Spear Hero." (Woman 2 I think)<br/>
"I-I see. I’ll also work hard to save the world for you all." (Ren)<br/>
Ren strengthened his resolve for the people who believed in him.<br/>
Sick of the people of this world turning on him, he clung to whoever said they trusted him…<br/>
The next morning… all his possessions were gone. Besides his sword, they had taken everything.<br/>
In their place was a single letter.<br/>
"This is that letter." (Ren)<br/>
He was keeping it on him?<br/>
Ren hands that letter over to me.<br/>
It looks like it’s been crushed before, but it’s still barely legible.<br/>
"Let’s see… "After much deliberation, we found that we would be unable to use you, so we took the liberty of taking everything we could use from you. I’m grateful you helped me escape from the Shield and the Spear, but neither your personality nor looks are of my preference. Let’s see… If you defeat the Shield, then perhaps I will show you some affection. But if it’s you it will probably be impossible. Ohohoho"." (Naofumi reading Witch’s letter) (TL: Can Ren even read?)<br/>
Annoying!<br/>
… Witch! She really deserves no salvation!<br/>
And to give up on Ren in only one day, that woman really works fast.<br/>
Could she have been aiming at Ren’s equipment and loot from the beginning?<br/>
"That’s when my head started to become a little strange… My field of vision turned pitch black, and I unlocked the Curse Series." (Ren)<br/>
The person he decided to trust turned on him immediately. I can understand his feelings.<br/>
If Raphtalia betrayed me right after I decided to trust her, then my Wrath Shield would have unlocked much sooner.<br/>
"After that… I fell. I left the inn, looking for money to replace what was lost… Just as it was taken, I wanted to take but I wanted to hide so I wore a mask…" (Ren)<br/>
He assaulted the bandit’s carriage, made them his subordinates, and built his Bandit troup.<br/>
His story was very straightforward.<br/>
"Naofumi… I’m truly sorry for not believing in you. This may be asking for too much, but will you not forgive me for the things I’ve done to you?" (Ren)<br/>
"I have no intentions of forgetting." (Naofumi)<br/>
"I see… Then If I cannot be forgiven for the sins I’ve piled up, I will lend you power to make up for them. Please remember those words." (Ren)<br/>
Ren faces me and earnestly lowers his head.<br/>
… It seems he’s really repenting.<br/>
The fact that I even considered forgiving him at that moment must be due to my weakness.<br/>
I have no idea whether I’ll ever forgive this world’s people.<br/>
And I plan to continue teasing him. I should at least have the right to do that.<br/>
"I never thought Witch was that low of a person. I had my doubts, but… She seemed to offer true kindness so I believed in her. It truly was a foolish move that shouldn’t be forgiven. That might have been out last chance to capture that woman…! No, I can’t let that be the last one!" (Ren)<br/>
"Well, she does have a needlessly good face, and she can tell lies without care. That woman." (Naofumi)<br/>
"Badmouthing the former princess? Well it’s not like I don’t see where you’re coming from…" (Female Knight)<br/>
Female Knight scratches her head and murmurs to herself.<br/>
But where exactly could that woman have gone?<br/>
From Ren’s story, she definitely has a conspirator.<br/>
Someone we might have seem before… Someone connected to Ren.<br/>
Who could it have been?<br/>
I have no idea.<br/>
For now, let’s put Witch’s letter aside and worry about Itsuki.<br/>
After coming to me, Motoyasu and Ren, there’s a high possibility she’ll go to Itsuki.<br/>
I don’t know what she’ll do, but it definitely won’t be anything good.<br/>
She never brings anything but trouble.<br/>
"Next is… Ah, right." (Naofumi)<br/>
I guess I should teach Ren how to get stronger.<br/>
He’s repenting, and it doesn’t sound bad to make him an ally.<br/>
Personally, I think he should suffer a bit more, but if Ren, the Hero of the Sword, were to grasp all the strengthening methods, and if he were to move at my command then he will have much more uses than leaving him be.<br/>
But I guess that depends on Female Knight.<br/>
"I’ll be having you do training to polish your body." (Female Knight)<br/>
"Even when I might be executed?" (Ren)<br/>
"What of it? I want you to polish your heart along with it." (Female Knight)<br/>
"…Understood." (Ren)<br/>
Ren follows Female Knight’s words.<br/>
I’m starting to see Female Knight as a muscle head. I wonder why.<br/>
"What is it?" (Female Knight)<br/>
"Nothing…" (Naofumi)<br/>
"It’s fine if we move as long as we’re within Gaelion’s magic, right?" (Female Knight)<br/>
"Yeah…" (Naofumi)<br/>
"You said that you would give your strength to Iwatani-dono. I will trust those words. Don’t let down my expectations!" (Female Knight)<br/>
"Y-yes!" (Ren)<br/>
Ren immediately submits to Female Knight.<br/>
I guess it works out for me just fine.<br/>
"Ren, if I gave you freedom of movement, what would you do?" (Naofumi)<br/>
"… I’d help the people I caused trouble for." (Ren)<br/>
"I see. Then what will you do about money? The guild won’t pay you, right?" (Naofumi)<br/>
"About that. There’s something I want you to look at." (Ren)<br/>
Ren beckons me closer. I wonder what it is.<br/>
"Naofumi, please give me a copper coin." (Ren)<br/>
"Hm? That sounds like a pain, but I can lend you one." (Naofumi)<br/>
"I can’t give it back." (Ren)<br/>
"Ha? Why not?" (Naofumi)<br/>
"It’s fine, just hand one over. I’ll trade it for drops." (Ren)<br/>
Ren pulls some fur out of his sword and tosses it over.<br/>
Its quality is poor…<br/>
But there’s no helping it. It’s worth more than one copper. I hand over one copper coin to Ren.<br/>
And… The second it comes into contact with Ren’s finger, the copper begins to turn black and erode away. It crumbles to dust, and gets swept away by the wind.<br/>
"What!?" (Naofumi)<br/>
"… It’s apparently the compensation for using my Curse Skill." (Ran)<br/>
My Blutopfer deals great damage to me and decreases my stats.<br/>
Ren’s skill’s compensation… is like this because it is Greed?<br/>
I guess the inability to hold anything precious can be considered a curse.<br/>
I guess Ren won’t be able to hold money for a while.<br/>
"All the drops also become of poor quality. I think it also decreases luck." (Ren)<br/>
"How long does it last… Wait, didn’t you use another one as well?" (Naofumi)<br/>
"… When I used that one, my level fell from 95 to 85… I don’t know if there are any other repercussions as well." (Ren)<br/>
Oy, the price was quite high.<br/>
Though mine is as well.<br/>
But from the extent of its effects, the side effects shouldn’t last as long as Blutopfer’s.<br/>
"You seem to have a lot of problems. So what will you do?" (Naofumi)<br/>
"Honestly, I wish to assist you as thanks for returning me to normal. This world isn’t a game. I need to make sure I don’t become conceited again. If I make a mistake, I want you to tell me. I’ve decided to believe Naofumi’s words." (Ren)<br/>
"I see…" (Naofumi)<br/>
… What’s with this sudden change?<br/>
His face shows some resolve, but his obedience is quite suspicious.<br/>
I should handle this with caution.<br/>
"I won’t run from my crimes anymore. If I am to be executed for my crimes relating to the Spirit Turtle, then I will gladly present my neck. But, I am to be forgiven, then Welt, Bakter, Terishia, Fauly, I will fight to achieve the peaceful world my four comrades wished for. That’s all I want now." (Ren)<br/>
Ren says, as he begins to do pushups.<br/>
