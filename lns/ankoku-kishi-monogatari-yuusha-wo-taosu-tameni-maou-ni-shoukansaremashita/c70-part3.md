Chapter 70.3: Song God’s Theater<br/>
Thinking that it couldn’t be helped, I moved my body.<br/>
I was attacked by vertigo when I tried to descend from the bed. This might be the side-effect of Assass. Though it was a miracle drug that could rapidly increase my power, it has a severe recoil.<br/>
I forced my feet to walk until I finally arrived at the entrance of the room.<br/>
The door was open from the inside. The latch was also inside.<br/>
Basically, I wasn’t being locked up at all.<br/>
I stumbled upon the stairs as soon as I left the room.<br/>
I heard someone’s voice from the floor below.<br/>
I somehow managed to descend the stairs while leaning on the handrail.<br/>
「Wait, Regena!! I think you shouldn’t do that!!」<br/>
It was the flustered voice of a man.<br/>
I heard the sound of splashing water from the place ahead of me. It seems the bathroom was right ahead of me.<br/>
"<br/>
"<br/>
I’d noticed this for a while now but, the owner of this house was a rich one.<br/>
Naturally, it doesn’t mean that having a bathroom in one house was normal, the same goes for any other house. That’s why public bathhouses were popular..<br/>
Only the riches could afford to have a bathroom in their own residence.<br/>
I approached the bathroom. I wonder who’s making that ruckus inside the bathroom? Let’s first confirm their faces.<br/>
「Please Master!! Please at least allow me to rinse your back!!」<br/>
「No, even if you say that… Kuna, please say something!!!」<br/>
「Muuh, If Regena rinses your back, it’s only natural for Kuna to rinse your front, right.」<br/>
「WHA!! STOP IT, KUNA!! UHOOO♪♪」<br/>
I was wondering what they’re doing there. I couldn’t see the inside since it was blocked by a thin silk-like cloth.<br/>
I got entangled on my own feet when I approached the source of the voice.<br/>
I fell forward just like that, taking down the thin cloth along with me.<br/>
「WHAT THE!!!」<br/>
Oh no, they noticed me. It’ll be bad if I don’t escape immediately.<br/>
But, my legs refused to move.<br/>
Someone then came in my direction.<br/>
「Are you alright?」<br/>
I raised my face, pulling the cloth that draped on my head off upon hearing that inquiry.<br/>
There, I saw a man standing in front of me.<br/>
And then, I saw THAT.<br/>
「M-MONSTEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEER!!!」<br/>
And screamed to the top of my lungs.<br/>
I was raised in Ishtar temple, the guardian of harlos. Even though I’m still a v*rgin, there were so many occasions where I saw naked men’s bodies due to the nature of the place I was raised in.<br/>
Amongst them, there were nasty men who would show off their small caterpillar-sized d*ck.<br/>
But, the one that this man in front of me had was definitely not a caterpillar. And no, it wasn’t a snake either. THAT was… an evil dragon.<br/>
That man’s face evoked the memories from before I fell unconscious.<br/>
That man was… the Dark Knight.<br/>
An indescribable fear rose in my heart.<br/>
「Your face is pale and your body can’t move properly. I think you still need some rest.」<br/>
The Dark Knight stretched his hand out to me as he told me so. When he did so, the Dark Knight’s evil dragon was also drawn near till just right in front of my face.<br/>
「U~hn.」<br/>
Thus, I fainted.<br/>
===<br/>
◆<br/>
Dark Knight; Kuroki<br/>
「LIES!! WHY WOULD AINOE-NEESAN TRY TO KILL ME!! AS IF I’M GOING TO BELIEVE THE DARK KNIGHT’S WORDS!!」<br/>
Sienna rebutted as she sent a harsh glare in my direction.<br/>
I heaved a sigh.<br/>
She was starting to rampage again after waking up again. Honestly, trying to calm her down was a tough job.<br/>
And then, I explained what happened to her so far after she calmed down.<br/>
「Believe it or not, that’s the truth.」<br/>
But, she didn’t seem to trust me.<br/>
「I won’t believe you… Ainoe-neesan is so kind to me.」<br/>
Sienna spoke with her head hanging down.<br/>
Well, she might’ve been kind when you’d just joined the troupe. But, it seems that kindness had slowly turned into hatred as Sienna became more and more popular.<br/>
「That might be true when you just joined the troupe. But, how about now?」<br/>
「…」<br/>
Sienna was at a loss for now.<br/>
It seems she finally realized the truth.<br/>
「Moreover, didn’t you realize that the Karkinos attack from before was to get rid of you?」<br/>
When I told her so, Sienna raised her face.<br/>
「Sure enough… I often find something falling from above, or poison mixed in my food or drink but… I heard that they’d already arrested the culprit after that. But, if that’s also Ainoe-neesan’s plot…」<br/>
Sienna was pondering deeply over this matter.<br/>
「Haa… Here, your belongings.」<br/>
I placed a certain thing on top of the desk.<br/>
「Are you sure about returning my sword?」<br/>
「Yeah. It’s originally your belonging after all. In addition, I think it’s better if you don’t use this drug again later.」<br/>
After the sword, I took out a small jar.<br/>
「Is that… the pot that contain assass?」<br/>
I just did a little investigation but even that was enough to know that assass was a dangerous drug.<br/>
Sure, the power of the one who consumes it would increase, but there was a severe recoil after the drug lost its effect. It was a dangerous drug that might kill its user if used improperly.<br/>
She slept throughout the day because of this drug.<br/>
Well, to think that my original plan to enjoy sightseeing in Ariadya went in a completely different direction.<br/>
「Why did you tell me that? It’s as if you’re worrying about me.」<br/>
Sienna asked with a puzzled look on her face.<br/>
Sure enough, the fact that I’m worrying about her was strange.<br/>
Why did I worry about her, I wonder?<br/>
I had no intentions of becoming a good person. That’s why I, myself, am not clear about the reason behind me saving her life.<br/>
「Kuroki~」<br/>
Kuna entered the room when I was worrying about this matter.<br/>
Kuna should be in the middle of drying her hair in the next room. Has she dried her hair already?<br/>
The thin silk-like loungewear she wore emphasized her perfect style and curves.<br/>
「Moonlight… Goddess.」<br/>
I heard Sienna muttering while she was looking at Kuna.<br/>
Kuna came from the side and then sat on my lap.<br/>
And then, Kuna let out an enchanting giggle, looking at Sienna as she leaned her head on my chest.<br/>
As if she was showing off our intimate relationship.<br/>
「You don’t have to go out of your way to save her, Kuroki. You should just kill her right away and be done with it.」<br/>
Sienna’s shoulder twitched upon hearing Kuna’s remark.<br/>
「No, you can’t do that, Kuna.」<br/>
I patted Kuna’s head while telling her so.<br/>
Sure enough, killing Sienna would take care of the problem, but I didn’t feel like doing that.<br/>
When considering my current position, I sided with the demon side rather than the human side. But, it didn’t mean that I’d never killed demons or monsters in the past.<br/>
Even though he felt no hesitation when killing monsters, he ended up hesitating when it came to killing humans. Maybe it has something to do with appearance.<br/>
He might not have opted to save Sienna if she was a monster.<br/>
It was discrimination to a certain extent.<br/>
「Mu~h. What are you going to do with this woman then? Are you going to increase the number of your woman again?」<br/>
Kuna spoke with bulging cheeks, seemingly vexed by that possibility.<br/>
「NO! I ABSOLUTELY HAVE NO INTENTION TO DO THAT!!!」<br/>
I desperately shook my head in denial.<br/>
I can’t deny the fact that Sienna was a rare beauty.<br/>
Her slender body and alluringly long legs aside, I’d already confirmed when I carried her back here, which must have been an act of god, that her skin was soft and had just enough springiness.<br/>
But, there was no way I’m gonna force her.<br/>
I wouldn’t force her no matter how much I wanted to lick her leg.<br/>
「Mumumu~!!!」<br/>
Kuna was pinching my side as I lost in my delusion about her deliciously long legs.<br/>
F*CK. It seems she realized what I was thinking about.<br/>
Kuna’s glare was too adorable.<br/>
「OUCH! IT HURTS, STOP! KUNA!」<br/>
After that, I somehow managed to pacify Kuna.<br/>
When I looked at Sienna, I found that she was looking at us with an anxious look on her face.<br/>
It was only natural for her to have that face knowing that she had barely avoided death.<br/>
Though I had no intentions of killing her, I couldn’t release her as it is. Reason being Ainoe would proceed straight to kill Sienna once I released the latter.<br/>
Moreover, there was a high possibility that Sienna might go to Reiji and co’s place.<br/>
When that happens, Ainoe would be executed for sure.<br/>
Though I had no intention of siding with AInoe, I also had no intention to side with Sienna since siding with either one of them was a huge demerit on my part.<br/>
That’s why I’d only confined Sienna to prevent her from escaping.<br/>
The black briar that twined around her body would tightened up whenever she tried to leave the mansion. That much should be enough to prevent her from escaping from this place.<br/>
Her livelihood itself would at least be guaranteed.<br/>
But, just as Kuna had said, I couldn’t keep her for a long time in this place.<br/>
What should I do now?<br/>
The important point in this case was that everything would be okay as long as Ainoe didn’t try to kill Sienna. In addition, I could release Sienna after I made her promise to not go to Reiji and co’s place.<br/>
For that, the first thing I had to do was persuade Ainoe.<br/>
But, was that possible? Will Sienna really be willing to reconcile with someone who tried to kill her?<br/>
「Ha~h.」<br/>
I guess I’ll have to at least try it first.<br/>
Thus, I made a plan to visit Ainoe tomorrow.<br/>
