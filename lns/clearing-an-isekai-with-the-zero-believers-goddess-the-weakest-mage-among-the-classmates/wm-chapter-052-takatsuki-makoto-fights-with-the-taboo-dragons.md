Damn it, I was looking forward to seeing your reactions when the cliffhanger of the previous chapter hit. Looks like you have been spared! <br/>
Enjoy!<br/>
<br/>
[Water Magic: Yamata no Orochi].<br/>
I put my everything on this spell that took me seven days of getting along with the Spirits.<br/>
Water Monarch Magic: Yamata No Orochi.<br/>
A gigantic 8-headed snake that could be mistaken for a mountain appears.<br/>
When I look back, there’s Sakurai-kun with an excited expression, Sa-san whose eyes are sparkling, and Yokoyama-san who fell on her butt.<br/>
"Hey hey, Takatsuki-kun! This is a snake, right?!" (Aya)<br/>
Looks like the lamia Sa-san felt some sort of kinship with it.<br/>
…This girl really has changed.<br/>
"Spirit-sans, there’s 2 displeasing guys down there. Can you please throw them out of the dungeon?" (Makoto)<br/>
*Hiissssssss!*<br/>
The Water Orochi raised a cry, and dove right into the darkness of the cave. <br/>
This is my first time using it, but the pressure of Monarch Rank Magic is incredible.<br/>
I heard that the magic above Superior Rank becomes life-like, but the Orochi feels like it is alive.<br/>
Or more like, scary.<br/>
I wonder if Lucy will one day use this kind of magic…<br/>
If her magic goes awry, I feel like the party would be wiped out.<br/>
"Takatsuki-kun! That’s incredible!" (Sakurai)<br/>
Sakurai-kun is totally hyped.<br/>
"It would be nice if it works though." (Makoto)<br/>
"That’s Monarch Magic?" (Sakurai)<br/>
"Yeah. I think it went well for being my first time." (Makoto)<br/>
"Eh?! …Is that so… M-Monarch Rank…?" (Yokoyama)<br/>
"Saki-chan, can you stand?" (Aya)<br/>
Sa-san helps Yokoyama-san who is sitting on her butt with weak legs.<br/>
"Sa-san, can you three regroup with Lucy and the others?" (Makoto)<br/>
"Okay but, what about you, Takatsuki-kun?" (Aya)<br/>
"I have to control the spell until the Taboo Dragons are brought outside the dungeon." (Makoto)<br/>
"What should I do?" (Sakurai)<br/>
Sakurai-kun asks.<br/>
Oi oi, what are you saying, Hero-sama?<br/>
"I will throw the enemies outside the dungeon, so cut them down." (Makoto)<br/>
"G-Got it." (Sakurai)<br/>
Water Magic may look flashy, but it has low attack power, so even with Monarch  Magic, I don’t think it can defeat the enemy.<br/>
"T-Takatsuki-kun!" (Yokoyama)<br/>
Yokoyama-san suddenly calls me.<br/>
"What’s the matter?" (Makoto)<br/>
"Y-Your back!" (Yokoyama)<br/>
*Splash!*<br/>
A giant splash of water rises and the Yamata Orochi appears once again.<br/>
*Kaaaaaaa!*<br/>
An ear-piercing cry resonates in the dungeon.<br/>
"That’s…a Taboo Dragon?" (Aya)<br/>
Sa-san mutters.<br/>
I am not confident to call it a dragon. It was like a gigantic white earth worm.<br/>
There’s several mouths on its body.<br/>
It is currently struggling with the Orochi wrapped around it.<br/>
The other dragon has eyes all over its body, and its eyes were moving around restlessly.<br/>
It is different from what I imagined.<br/>
They called it a fiendish dragon, so I imagined something a bit more grim and sinister.<br/>
If I had to describe it…<br/>
"What’s that?! Gross!" (Aya)<br/>
"Right?" (Makoto)<br/>
I agree with Sa-san.<br/>
The Taboo Dragon is gross. Gross Dragon.<br/>
*Kaaaaaaaaaaaa!*<br/>
The Taboo Dragons raise ear-piercing cries that sound like the scratching of glass as they get taken away by the Orochi.<br/>
"Now, Sakurai-kun, let’s go." (Makoto)<br/>
"Y-Yeah…" (Sakurai)<br/>
◇◇<br/>
The Taboo Dragon is struggling to escape from the coiling of the Orochi. <br/>
I control the spell in order to not allow that, and carry them.<br/>
"Takatsuki-kun, how are you gonna bring them outside?" (Sakurai)<br/>
"There’s a place at the underground lake where there’s a hole. I will bring them all the way there and throw them outside." (Makoto)<br/>
*Kaaaaaaaaaaa!!!*<br/>
The Taboo Dragon is raising screams of pain.<br/>
That one is the Taboo Dragon with lots of mouths, huh.<br/>
"Takatsuki-kun, the Taboo Dragon’s voice has an effect that makes your heart have doubts. Are you okay? Our mages were unable to use magic from that voice." (Sakurai)<br/>
"Is that so." (Makoto)<br/>
It is true that it is a disturbing voice.<br/>
But it doesn’t seem like it is to the point of making me unable to use magic.<br/>
Probably the effect of Clear Mind.<br/>
"It seems like I’m okay." (Makoto)<br/>
"…Our high rank mages were wiped out by that though…" (Sakurai)<br/>
Sakurai-kun said this amazed.<br/>
"Then, does the guy there with a whole lot of eyes have a bad effect as well?" (Makoto)<br/>
"Yeah, you apparently get hit with charm magic when you meet eyes with it. Are you okay?" (Sakurai)<br/>
In regards to charm, it didn’t work with the harpy either.<br/>
"No problems. Are you okay, Sakurai-kun?" (Makoto)<br/>
"With the divine protection of the Sun Goddess, I am not affected by abnormal status effects." (Sakurai)<br/>
"…"<br/>
This damn cheat.<br/>
Sakurai-kun doesn’t notice my gaze.<br/>
*Gyaaaaaaaaa!!*<br/>
He is watching the violent struggle between the two Taboo Dragons and the Water Orochi with excitement.<br/>
"There’s practically no Monarch Rank Mages even in the Highland Kingdom. Especially Water Monarch Magic. It is the first time I see it." (Sakurai)<br/>
"I had to prepare for 7 days in order to use this spell once. Moreover, I can’t use it unless the Spirits are cooperative. It isn’t magic that can be fueled easily." (Makoto)<br/>
"It is not only about activating it. It is pretty rare to see a mage that can control their magic to this extent, you know." (Sakurai)<br/>
He is praising me quite a whole lot.<br/>
Is there no good mage in the Sun Country of Highland?<br/>
"We are close to seeing it." (Makoto)<br/>
There’s the sunlight coming in from the hole at the top of this underground lake area.<br/>
Night has already passed, it seems.<br/>
"It is great that Lucy’s meteors widened the big hole." (Makoto)<br/>
"Did you say something?" (Sakurai)<br/>
"No, speaking to myself." (Makoto)<br/>
Now then, the last step! <br/>
"Sakurai-kun, I will bring the Taboo Dragons outside. My spell will disappear the moment it gets outside, so there’s no redoing." (Makoto)<br/>
"I heard nothing about that!" (Yokoyama)<br/>
Ah, should I have told Saki beforehand?<br/>
"Sakurai-kun should be okay, right?" (Makoto)<br/>
"Kuh, I will!" (Sakurai)<br/>
Sakurai-kun shows an expression of resolve.<br/>
"Spirit-sans, we are going there." (Makoto)<br/>
I ride on top of the Orochi’s head.<br/>
There’s the Taboo Dragon with eyes all-over closeby.<br/>
(Uhe, it is grosser when close…) (Makoto)<br/>
Let’s finish this quickly.<br/>
[Water Magic: Colossal Ascending Dragon].<br/>
The Yamata no Orochi changes its shape into a giant dragon, and rises up to the big hole at the top of the dungeon with the two Taboo Dragons and me.<br/>
(Thanks…Spirit-sans.) (Makoto)<br/>
The moment we left the dungeon, my Spirit Magic lost power, and disappeared.<br/>
The Taboo Dragons and I were thrown outside from high up in the air.<br/>
(Has Sakurai-kun arrived?) (Makoto)<br/>
Thinking this, I see Sakurai-kun clad in a golden aura. <br/>
(He is absorbing the light of the sun?) (Makoto)<br/>
His shine is increasing more and more.<br/>
This is the Light Hero Skill, huh.<br/>
I leave the rest to you, Sakurai-kun.<br/>
