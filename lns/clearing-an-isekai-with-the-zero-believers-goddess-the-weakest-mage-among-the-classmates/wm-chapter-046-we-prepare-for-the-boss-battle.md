<br/>
-Sasaki Aya POV-<br/>
"How is it? Do you think you can use Stealth, Sa-san?" (Makoto)<br/>
Takatsuki-kun asks.<br/>
I am currently in the middle of training my Stealth Skill. <br/>
"Yeah, I think I get it somewhat. But it is difficult." (Aya)<br/>
We are at the Mid Floor of Laberintos.<br/>
On the space at the back of the giant waterfall.<br/>
It is my favorite place, but lately it became a saddening place that reminded me of my family.<br/>
However, it doesn’t sadden me as much now.<br/>
"…"<br/>
When I look at my side, I see Takatsuki-kun spreading his hands in the sky, and saying something in a low voice.<br/>
"What are you doing?" (Aya)<br/>
"I am speaking to the Spirits around here. Telling them to let’s get along." (Makoto)<br/>
"Uhm, when you get along with Spirits, your Spirit Magic gets stronger, was it?" (Aya)<br/>
"Yeah, it is pretty quirky magic, you see." (Makoto)<br/>
"Do you think you can get along with the Spirits?" (Aya)<br/>
"I do. The Spirits of Laberintos are pretty cooperative. They are easy to speak to." (Makoto)<br/>
"Is that so." (Aya)<br/>
I can’t see these so called Spirits, so it doesn’t really click with me.<br/>
But Takatsuki-kun seems to be having fun.<br/>
I don’t remember when, but in the past I thought that he would be happy if he were to come to this world, and that’s exactly what happened.<br/>
While I spaced out watching him, I continued training the Skill.<br/>
"Shh! Sa-san, there’s harpies." (Makoto)<br/>
"!" <br/>
Tension runs.<br/>
My heart that was jumping grows cold.<br/>
When I looked at the atrium part of the cave from the opening of the waterfall, I saw several harpies circling around.<br/>
They are probably searching for prey.<br/>
*Grind!*…I could feel my teeth grinding.<br/>
Acting as if nothing happened. I am going to send the whole lot of you to hell! <br/>
Maybe he noticed my feelings, Takatsuki-kun speaks to me calmly. <br/>
"Sa-san, do those guys always appear from around there?" (Makoto)<br/>
"…Yeah, as far as I know, they come from that big hole where the light comes in from." (Aya)<br/>
"Then, it would be best to think that their nest is also around that part." (Makoto)<br/>
"But we won’t be able to reach that place with us being unable to fly…" (Aya)<br/>
I also think that their nest is close to the ceiling of this underground lake area.<br/>
But there’s no path to reach there.<br/>
"Let’s think about that later with everyone… Looks like those guys flew somewhere else." (Makoto)<br/>
Just as Takatsuki-kun said, the harpies disappeared deep into this underground area.<br/>
"It should be okay now." (Makoto)<br/>
"Yeah." (Aya)<br/>
We go back to what we were doing.<br/>
We are mostly silent in order to not let monsters find us.<br/>
But compared to the loneliness of when I was living alone in this dungeon, this truly calms my heart.<br/>
(However…) (Aya)<br/>
If I were asked whether everything is calming, I would be able to say for sure… <br/>
There’s something that bothers me.<br/>
(The times when we are both alone are most likely gonna be rare.) (Aya)<br/>
I should ask this as naturally as possible.<br/>
I speak to him in a tone as if beginning a normal conversation.<br/>
"Hey, Takatsuki-kun, what kind of relationship do you have with Lucy-san?" (Aya)<br/>
Ah, the way of asking might have been a bit too straight.<br/>
I wonder if he thought weirdly of it.<br/>
But it bothers me.<br/>
The beautiful red haired elf girl.<br/>
She gave me a bit of a thorny impression, but when I spoke to her, she was a girl with a refreshing personality.<br/>
And for some reason, she wears thinly.<br/>
To the point that it made even a girl like me skip a beat.<br/>
"What kind of relationship, you ask? I told you already, didn’t I? A comrade that I formed a party with around half a year ago." (Makoto)<br/>
"A party with only you two, right?" (Aya)<br/>
"At times we would be together with Fuji-yan, or go together with other adventurers. We do have different members every now and then. I was mostly solo though." (Makoto)<br/>
"You adventure alone?" (Aya)<br/>
"It is comfortable after all. I am a pro at goblin hunting, I’ll have you know." (Makoto)<br/>
For some reason, he was making a proud expression.<br/>
It is the same face he was making when he was playing games in his free time on the field trip.<br/>
(He hasn’t changed.) (Aya)<br/>
"But now with Sa-san, it will be a party of 3." (Makoto)<br/>
"Eh?" (Aya)<br/>
"Hm? You don’t want to?" (Makoto)<br/>
"No! Of course I’m okay!" (Aya)<br/>
That surprised me.<br/>
I was thinking about asking him to let me into his party eventually. <br/>
I see, I am already a part of the party! <br/>
"Ah, but I haven’t consulted with Lucy yet." (Makoto)<br/>
"…"<br/>
"But I am sure it will be alright." (Makoto)<br/>
He is calling Lucy without honorifics.<br/>
As far as I know, Takatsuki-kun didn’t have any female friends he would call without honorifics.<br/>
Thinking like that, he is pretty close to Lucy-san.<br/>
(Just that, it seems like calling people by their name is the normal practice in this world…) (Aya)<br/>
Lucy-san suddenly called me ‘Aya’ after all.<br/>
(Would it be better if I call him ‘Makoto’, too? But it would be weird to suddenly change my way of calling him… Uuuh…) (Aya)<br/>
While feeling fuzzy, we continued that day’s training and exploration.<br/>
◇◇<br/>
 -Lucy POV-<br/>
"Now then, let’s begin the training to control your fire." (Makoto)<br/>
After finishing dinner, I began training at the outskirts of the Adventurer City with Makoto.<br/>
I was together with Fujiyan-san and Nina for the day. <br/>
We went to the Adventurer Guild and the merchants to get information about the Harpy Queen, but the results were not good.<br/>
Everyone was gossipping about the Taboo Dragon or the Sun Knight Order and the Light Hero. <br/>
"Apparently, in 2-3 days, the Sun Knight Order will be leaving to subjugate the Taboo Dragon." (Lucy)<br/>
"Hoh, then once the subjugation is done, the monsters in Laberintos might calm down." (Makoto)<br/>
"That’s what they say. The adventurers and merchants were grieving the fact that because of the dragon appearing at the Upper Floor, explorations have reduced, and it is affecting business." (Lucy)<br/>
"Well, figures." (Makoto)<br/>
While saying this, Makoto was using his water magic to create a small dragon and flew it about. <br/>
Even though it was a water ball just a few days ago…<br/>
His art is becoming even more detailed.<br/>
"How many Stone Bullets can you bring out at once now, Lucy?" (Makoto)<br/>
"Only 3…" (Lucy)<br/>
"Ooh, nice. It increased." (Makoto)<br/>
Makoto says this while having 9 mini-sized dragons flying around him.<br/>
I feel like he is making fun of me.<br/>
"How in the world do you make it so you can have such minute control?" (Lucy)<br/>
"When you surpass 120 in Water Magic Proficiency, you can do this." (Makoto)<br/>
"…Okay." (Lucy)<br/>
I was an idiot for asking.<br/>
It doesn’t serve as reference at all.<br/>
What is Proficiency: 120? <br/>
My fire magic proficiency is 15 and my earth magic proficiency is 11.<br/>
Just that, earth magic is easier to use thanks to the staff.<br/>
More accurately speaking, it is thanks to the magic staff that the God Giant tinkered with.<br/>
The training we are doing right now is training to increase the amount of Falling Meteors I can do.<br/>
The amount of harpies that will be this time’s opponent are many.<br/>
‘We want to defeat as many of them as possible in the first move’, is the opinion of Makoto.<br/>
(The Harpy Queen… The target of revenge for the Lamias, the family of Sasaki Aya.) (Lucy)<br/>
The adventure this time around originates from the lamia girl we met recently.<br/>
A girl that had been reincarnated as a Lamia.<br/>
And an acquaintance of Makoto.<br/>
(What kind of acquaintance was she?) (Lucy)<br/>
I heard that ‘she is a friend of mine that studied in the same school as us’.<br/>
Saying ‘she was a bit more of a docile girl before though’ as he laughed, Aya went ‘what do you mean by that?’, and bonged the head of Makoto.<br/>
They get along well.<br/>
Not only that, they are close.<br/>
(They were exploring Laberintos all alone today… Moreover, he said that he invited her to the party.) (Lucy)<br/>
Invite Sasaki Aya to the party.<br/>
I have no issues with that.<br/>
She is the friend of Makoto and Fujiyan-san.<br/>
They are otherworldlers and she has no other acquaintances here.<br/>
Moreover, she reincarnated into a monster, so we can’t act as people who don’t know about her circumstances.<br/>
It is natural to help her.<br/>
But what bothers me is…<br/>
(Aya probably likes Makoto…) (Lucy)<br/>
Did she love him from way back?<br/>
Or did she fall in love with him in this world after they reunited?<br/>
I don’t know.<br/>
"By the way, Lucy, can you guide Sa-san around the city tomorrow?" (Makoto)<br/>
"Eh? Kya!" (Lucy)<br/>
Being suddenly thrown that topic, I ended up dropping the Stone Bullet that I was controlling.<br/>
The rock that was burning with fire magic scorched the ground.<br/>
"Are you okay?" (Makoto)<br/>
"Y-Yeah. By the way, only me? What will you do, Makoto?" (Lucy)<br/>
"I will be communicating with the Spirits in Laberintos again." (Makoto)<br/>
"Are you okay alone?" (Lucy)<br/>
"I have done the [Mapping] of all the escape routes, so I am okay alone. I want you to teach Sa-san how to shop and how to use money." (Makoto)<br/>
"Got it…" (Lucy)<br/>
Alone with Aya, huh.<br/>
After finishing training…we finished the day with fuzzy feelings still in my heart.<br/>
