One would be drenched in sweat just by walking,<br/>
the sun was intense, as if summer had come early.<br/>
Altina urged her horse Karakara forth, and<br/>
looked back several times.<br/>
—— As expected, I should have let everybody<br/>
rest?<br/>
The troops were exhausted, dragging their feet<br/>
as if they were going to collapse.<br/>
But their faces were full of life.<br/>
Because they were going to reach Fort Volks<br/>
soon.<br/>
The base they had left for over a month.<br/>
They can shower, sleep on a bed and eat the food<br/>
they were familiar with after they return.<br/>
Despite their fatigue, the soldiers had bright<br/>
expressions.<br/>
Deeply troubled.<br/>
Altina was always troubled.<br/>
At this moment, if Regis was here, he would be<br/>
able to adjust the plans for the troop’s movement according to the situation.<br/>
Thinking back, Altina had always left these to him.<br/>
If Jerome was here, he would be able to make the<br/>
right call after seeing the conditions of the soldiers.<br/>
Altina didn’t have related knowledge or<br/>
experience. On the return trip after this long campaign, the season was rather<br/>
hot. Even though she felt it would be better for them to rest, she didn’t want<br/>
to go against the troop’s wishes to return home quickly.<br/>
She kept dragging the issue as she couldn’t<br/>
decide. Following the movement plan Regis made before he left, it was time for<br/>
a short break.<br/>
Even when the soldiers heard that, they would<br/>
just answer ‘no problem!’. That’s how they were.<br/>
But the 7,000 soldiers had to carry their<br/>
weapons and push the cannons. Some of them were collapsing from fatigue.<br/>
There were casualties from the consecutive<br/>
battles too.<br/>
The soldiers who couldn’t keep up and needed to<br/>
get picked up by the rescue wagons were more than usual.<br/>
Should she let everyone rest?<br/>
Or just carry on like this?<br/>
The soldiers walking in front shouted:<br/>
"I can see the fort——!!"<br/>
Wooahhh! Cheers erupted.<br/>
The joyous atmosphere was contagious, which made<br/>
Altina smile.<br/>
But her frustration over her lack of experience<br/>
as a commander clouded her heart.<br/>
She was only depressed for a moment.<br/>
Just treat this as an experience! Altina was<br/>
someone who could think so positively.<br/>
The Beilschmidt Border Regiment left as a unit<br/>
of 4,000, and returned as the Imperial Fourth Army with almost twice the<br/>
numbers.<br/>
The soldiers came out from the fort.<br/>
Because a messenger alerted them that the unit<br/>
out on a long campaign had returned.<br/>
The one at the very front was Evrard.<br/>
He was a tall and burly knight, the captain of<br/>
the fort defences. He was over fifty years old, but still very energetic.<br/>
"Your Highness~~~!!"<br/>
"It’s been a while, Evrard!"<br/>
"Wonderful! Just wonderful! It’s great that you<br/>
are alright!"<br/>
Evrard galloped over, jumped off his horse and<br/>
got down on one knee.<br/>
His bald head was shiny as usual, and his beard<br/>
was a mix of black and white.<br/>
It had just been a month, but it probably<br/>
worried him a lot.<br/>
Altina dismounted too.<br/>
"You watched over the fort well, thank you."<br/>
"You are being too distant!"<br/>
With a tremor of footsteps, the soldiers from<br/>
the fort ran over.<br/>
The joy of reuniting with their returning<br/>
comrades could be heard everywhere.<br/>
The Beilschmidt Border Regiment was originally<br/>
from the Empire. They had acquaintances even in the Second Army.<br/>
There were people who met again unexpectedly.<br/>
And also grieving for the comrades who couldn’t<br/>
return.<br/>
Altina looked down at the soldiers around her.<br/>
"... Men, are not just numbers."<br/>
"What’s the matter, Princess?"<br/>
"... I lost a thousand men from the Beilschmidt<br/>
Border Regiment that left for the campaign. Even though they have their<br/>
companions and families."<br/>
"I heard that High Britannia was using new<br/>
weapons that had never been seen before. The Second and Seventh Army were<br/>
defeated, even Prince Latreille was wounded. The enemy even made it all the way<br/>
before the capital. Despite the hard battles, you still brought back 3,000<br/>
soldiers safely, that is something to cheer for."<br/>
"Yes… Even though I told Regis the same thing."<br/>
"The sense of responsibility and mourning for<br/>
the men we lost isn’t a bad thing. We are no longer on the battlefield. I may<br/>
have overstepped my bounds, but I prepared a victory feast. There will be<br/>
plenty of wine and meat."<br/>
"Fufu… Thank you. Let’s go back to the fort!"<br/>
Altina mounted her horse.<br/>
Evrard rode beside her.<br/>
The bugles sounded again, and the soldiers<br/>
walked shoulder to shoulder.<br/>
They began singing patriotic songs.<br/>
Altina asked:<br/>
"By the way, where’s Eric?"<br/>
Evrard who was smiling all this while became<br/>
depressed.<br/>
He was full of life just a moment ago, and now<br/>
he looked like an old man.<br/>
After reaching the fort, they saw a swordsman in<br/>
black clothes and a silver haired youth descending the stairs.<br/>
It was Eddie and Auguste.<br/>
"Yo, Altina! You are back!"<br/>
"... It’s great that you are alright."<br/>
Even though he was dressed like a man before the<br/>
troops, Auguste’s real identity was Felicia.<br/>
Altina raised a hand in response.<br/>
A large carriage entered the fort. Clarisse got<br/>
down and bowed deeply.<br/>
Eddie tilted his head.<br/>
"Eh? Where’s Regis?"<br/>
"He went to the capital for his promotion and acceptance<br/>
of his peerage."<br/>
"I see. That will happen after all his<br/>
accomplishment."<br/>
"Really! Right when the Germanian Federation is<br/>
about to attack!"<br/>
"Well, the Empire had never been peaceful."<br/>
"That might be so…"<br/>
Some of the soldiers led the horses to rest,<br/>
some carried the wounded to the infirmary, and the fort became lively.<br/>
It would be fine to leave the rest to Evrard.<br/>
Altina walked to her room. And climbed a long<br/>
flight of stairs.<br/>
"Eddie, Felicia, are both of you well?"<br/>
"I didn’t even catch a cold."<br/>
"... Sorry, I caught a cold once."<br/>
Felicia didn’t need to act since there wasn’t<br/>
any soldiers here, and showed her usual frail and demure side.<br/>
When she was acting as Auguste, one could even<br/>
feel a majestic aura, such incredible acting skills.<br/>
Eddie scratched his head.<br/>
"Ah, well… it can’t be helped for Felicia. The<br/>
cold weather persisted longer than usual."<br/>
"... I-Is that so?"<br/>
"It will be great if I can protect you from<br/>
catching a cold. Well, if you are feeling under the weather, don’t be too<br/>
concerned about anything and just rely on me."<br/>
"Yes… Thank you. I will count on you like usual<br/>
then."<br/>
"I will make the cold days warm too."<br/>
"... I’m so glad."<br/>
Felicia’s cheeks blushed.<br/>
It didn’t suit him, but Eddie smiled with a<br/>
gentle gaze too.<br/>
Altina felt her mood strangely turning for the<br/>
worse.<br/>
She felt that she was an eyesore?<br/>
And sighed.<br/>
She shifted her gaze away from them, and looked<br/>
at Clarisse who was walking slightly behind her.<br/>
"... Hey Clarisse."<br/>
"What can I do for you, Princess?"<br/>
"When will Regis be back?"<br/>
"... I asked him, he said it would take between<br/>
a week to a month. After finishing his business at the capital, he would need<br/>
some time to come back here. It would probably take between 6 to 30 days."<br/>
"Hmm, it would take that much time after all…<br/>
Hah… It would be great if I could go to the capital too."<br/>
Altina slouched her shoulders.<br/>
Eddie smiled wryly.<br/>
"What are you saying? The commander can’t leave<br/>
her unit behind and run off. If you do that, it wouldn’t be your unit anymore."<br/>
"Yeah... This is unreasonable, I know at least<br/>
that much. But for some reason, whenever I see you and Felicia, I will feel the<br/>
urge of wanting to see Regis! I don’t understand why though."<br/>
"Hmm? But why?"<br/>
Eddie looked baffled.<br/>
Felicia who was blushing turned a deeper shade<br/>
of red, and was stammering.<br/>
"T-That is… Sister…"<br/>
"Ara ara…"<br/>
Clarisse sighed deeply.<br/>
Altina parted with Eddie and Felicia in front of<br/>
her room ——<br/>
She entered her room and wiped herself with hot<br/>
water.<br/>
And sat inside a wooden bucket.<br/>
Clarisse soaked a silk cloth with hot water from<br/>
a flask, and gently squeezed the water onto Altina’s skin.<br/>
She started warming up.<br/>
"Phew…"<br/>
"Your skin is really beautiful, Princess.<br/>
"Is that so? But I think it’s similar to<br/>
Clarisse though?"<br/>
"Fufu, thank you very much. But the Princess’<br/>
skin is like a shiny gem. And it looks so tender and delicious."<br/>
"... Y-You can’t bite okay?"<br/>
"Don’t worry, I won’t. But… Such a day will come<br/>
one day. Hah… My dear Princess…"<br/>
"I will be bitten? Don’t joke with me, I won’t<br/>
let my guard down no matter who my opponent is."<br/>
"... You said guard down."<br/>
"Hm?"<br/>
"Fufufu… You don’t need to worry for now. Your<br/>
Highness is really the Princess."<br/>
"Hmmm?"<br/>
Clarisse became strangely happy, and wiped<br/>
Altina’s body as if she wanted her skin to shine.<br/>
As if her troubles and filth from the long<br/>
campaign had been washed away, Altina’s mood got better.<br/>
She sat before her dressing table she had not<br/>
seen for so long that she was starting to missed it. Clarisse helped to brush<br/>
her hair.<br/>
Altina giggled.<br/>
"Hee… Eheehee."<br/>
"Your highness, does it tickles?"<br/>
"Not at all. It just feel so nostalgic."<br/>
"That’s true."<br/>
"Hey Clarisse… You will stay with me forever<br/>
right?"<br/>
"Of course. But Regis will be back soon right?"<br/>
"I-I’m not talking about Regis!? Well, of course<br/>
he will be back. He promised."<br/>
Clarisse applied a thin layer of oil, and<br/>
Altina’s hair was elegant just like her skin.<br/>
But it was a bit itchy and Altina kept fidgeting<br/>
her body.<br/>
The victory feast began in the evening, the<br/>
campaign group, garrison group and the former Second Army soldiers all drank<br/>
together.<br/>
Even though training was the only way to improve<br/>
the coordination between the units, this could deepen the bonds between them<br/>
mentally.<br/>
Being happy about surviving, feeling sad for<br/>
those who passed, the banquet lasted into the wee hours of the night.<br/>
It might carry on until dawn.<br/>
Night——<br/>
Altina visited Eric who didn’t attend the<br/>
victory feast.<br/>
She found out from the lady doctor that Eric had<br/>
recovered, and didn’t need to stay in the infirmary and was staying home too.<br/>
She knocked on the door.<br/>
"... Who is it?"<br/>
A response came from behind the door.<br/>
Altina took a deep breath and said:<br/>
"I’m alone, is it convenient?"<br/>
"Eh!? Your Highness!?"<br/>
A high pitched panicky voice sounded out,<br/>
followed by hurried footsteps.<br/>
After the sound of the door being unlocked, the<br/>
door was opened forcefully.<br/>
It was late at night, but Eric was still wearing<br/>
his usual leather clothes as he stood there with his eyes wide open.<br/>
Altina smiled awkwardly.<br/>
"Sorry, it took quite a bit of effort to excuse<br/>
myself from the feast. Were you sleeping?"<br/>
"Not at all!"<br/>
The candles flickered in the room.<br/>
Normally speaking, it was possible to make it<br/>
through the night with just the moonlight. But Fort Volks was modified from a<br/>
mine, so there wasn’t any windows for lighting.<br/>
The soldiers would use torchlight and candles to<br/>
illuminate the room.<br/>
"I have something to tell you, is it<br/>
convenient?"<br/>
"Y-Yes! I will change right now and visit you in<br/>
the meeting room!"<br/>
"There is no need for that but… wouldn't it be<br/>
better not to do it in the corridor?"<br/>
Sound would carry in the corridor.<br/>
Finally, Altina entered the room. Eric went down<br/>
on one knee.<br/>
"For Your Highness to enter such a place is…"<br/>
"Well, according to the lady doctor’s report,<br/>
your injuries have healed right? So I was wondering why you didn’t show up at<br/>
the victory feast."<br/>
"Ugh… M-My apologies! I should have put<br/>
everything down and greeted you!"<br/>
"Alright, hearing flattery words too often gets<br/>
kind of annoying. It’s not something that could be done by my own power.<br/>
Instead of that, I am more worried about your condition."<br/>
Eric lowered his gaze to the floor as he knelt.<br/>
Normally, a Non-Commissioned Officer such as a<br/>
Fifth Grade Combat Officer would bunk together with others inside a large room.<br/>
However, Eric was assigned a personal room<br/>
because he was Altina’s Escort Officer.<br/>
Beside the bed was a nice desk.<br/>
If Altina sat at the desk, she would be looking<br/>
down at the kneeling Eric.<br/>
In the past, when she visit Regis without<br/>
invitation, he would sit on the bed and offer her the chair.<br/>
On hindsight, a Fifth Grade Admin officer acting<br/>
so respectfully wouldn’t be a surprise.<br/>
She turned into a strange person once again.<br/>
With no other choice, Altina pulled the chair<br/>
before the bed and sat on it.<br/>
Eric, it’s hard to talk like this, so sit on the<br/>
bed."<br/>
"Eh!? H-how could I…"<br/>
"When it is just the two of us, it’s fine to not<br/>
be so formal. I didn’t come here to make you kneel, but to speak with you."<br/>
"... My apologies."<br/>
Eric sat down cautiously and respectfully on the<br/>
edge of the bed.<br/>
This was bought after they took down Fort Volks,<br/>
not a straw filled mattress, but layers of cloth laid on top of a springboard.<br/>
A high class item provided to Commissioned Officers.<br/>
He croaked a little.<br/>
Although Eric paid more attention to formalities<br/>
than others, he wasn’t that stubborn.<br/>
He must have his reasons —— Altina guessed.<br/>
It was probably related to Evrard’s gloomy<br/>
expression.<br/>
"... Well? What’s the reason?"<br/>
Altina preferred getting straight to the point<br/>
instead of going round in circles.<br/>
Eric lowered his head.<br/>
"Ughhh…"<br/>
"Is it something you can’t tell me?"<br/>
"Not at all!"<br/>
Tears welled in his eyes.<br/>
His shoulders trembled.<br/>
Altina waited quietly for his reply.<br/>
She was no longer a child, she will hold it back<br/>
if necessary. Even more so for the sake of her subordinates.<br/>
Eric opened his lightly trembling lips.<br/>
"My left hand…"<br/>
"Yes. I heard that your wound has healed?"<br/>
Eric’s tears streamed down his cheeks.<br/>
"... I… Can’t be a knight anymore."<br/>
He gritted his teeth.<br/>
And reached out his left hand.<br/>
His fingers were trembling.<br/>
"... I can’t… use any strength."<br/>
His pale slender fingers were just like a<br/>
girl’s.<br/>
But there weren’t any wounds.<br/>
Altina reached out with her left hand and<br/>
touched his fingers.<br/>
"Grip it."<br/>
Eric clasped his left hand with a pained<br/>
expression.<br/>
It was akin to shaking hands.<br/>
He should be able to hold a mug.<br/>
But it would be impossible to lift heavy<br/>
weapons.<br/>
Knights need to hold their lance in their right<br/>
hand, and the reins with their left. If they couldn’t muster the strength, they<br/>
wouldn’t be able to fight on horseback.<br/>
Tears fell from Eric’s eyes.<br/>
"Ughh… Uuu… That’s all I can do…"<br/>
"Is that so…"<br/>
"If… I can only use such child-like strength… I<br/>
won’t be able to fight. I can’t be the Princess’ shield, and will be a burden<br/>
instead…"<br/>
He held back his sobs and said between snivels.<br/>
Altina held back with the same strength as Eric.<br/>
"B-But the lady doctor said the power should<br/>
recover in two months…"<br/>
Eric shook his head.<br/>
"No… That’s not it… She is referring to my<br/>
shoulder… Even though it is recovering… But my fingers couldn’t use any<br/>
strength."<br/>
Altina had participated in many battles, and<br/>
this wasn’t the first time she visited wounded soldiers.<br/>
She met soldiers whose shoulders and back were<br/>
hurt, and knew that they lost their strength in their arms and legs.<br/>
Even though their muscles were still there,<br/>
there were people who couldn’t move their fingers or even stand up.<br/>
Without understanding the reason, there was no<br/>
way to cure it too.<br/>
Eric’s grip was as strong as a child.<br/>
It won’t affect his daily life, but he won’t be<br/>
able to serve as an Escort Officer, or even as a soldier.<br/>
Altina’s hand that was holding him turned stiff.<br/>
She didn’t know what to say.<br/>
"......"<br/>
"Ughh… Your Highness… I am sorry… I… I am<br/>
useless now…"<br/>
Eric’s shoulders trembled as he gritted his<br/>
teeth loudly.<br/>
He won’t be able to take the field like this.<br/>
He won’t be able to handle the task of ferrying<br/>
supplies.<br/>
Normally, he would be discharged and sent home.<br/>
But would this be fine? Regis said that if Eric<br/>
hadn’t been there, he would have died.<br/>
"T-That’s right, if it was Regis…"<br/>
"... Eh?"<br/>
Eric wiped his eyes that had gotten swollen<br/>
because of his tears.<br/>
Altina grabbed his left hand with both of her<br/>
hands suddenly.<br/>
"I am sorry. Maybe I said something cruel. You<br/>
can be angry for my irresponsibility and willfulness… but, I still think that<br/>
Eric is a reliable Escort Officer."<br/>
"Y-Your Highness…?"<br/>
"During the Founding Day festival, Regis said<br/>
that it was thanks to you that we noticed that Auguste was actually a girl<br/>
disguised as a boy. You also prepared the horses for our escape, and protected<br/>
Regis during the fight with Franziska of ‘Renard Pendu’."<br/>
"... Y-Yes."<br/>
"I don’t want to lose Eric. Consult the lady<br/>
doctor again. She just got back from the campaign, and has yet to diagnose your<br/>
injury in detail right?"<br/>
"Y-Yes… But her diagnosis would definitely be<br/>
that it is hopeless."<br/>
"No matter how long it is, I will wait. And<br/>
maybe Regis would know something."<br/>
"Regis… must be disappointed… to see me like<br/>
this right…?"<br/>
Eric looked really timid.<br/>
Altina shook her head hard.<br/>
"Not at all! Impossible! Regis won’t just sit<br/>
and watch idly! Definitely! He will definitely say ‘I read about this in a book<br/>
before’!"<br/>
"... Really?"<br/>
"Yes, really."<br/>
Eric lowered his eyes.<br/>
And sighed.<br/>
"But… Regis he… didn’t visit the infirmary or<br/>
came here. Did he already forgot about it?"<br/>
"Don’t be stupid! Regis went to the capital for<br/>
his promotion and to accept his peerage!"<br/>
"Eh!?"<br/>
"Didn’t anyone tell you!? Sigh… But you didn’t<br/>
ask either. I just came to find out how your health is. Oh right, I promised to<br/>
write letters to him."<br/>
"Letters? Your Highness… will be writing?"<br/>
Eric wiped his eyes and showed a shocked<br/>
expression once again.<br/>
Altina frowned.<br/>
"What, I’m just writing a letter, why are you<br/>
making it sound so strange?"<br/>
"I-I didn’t say that! It’s just that… I didn’t<br/>
see Your Highness holding a pen much."<br/>
"Even I can write letters. I already promised. I<br/>
will write every day."<br/>
"Every day!?"<br/>
Eric opened his eyes wide as if he had forgotten<br/>
about his own matters.<br/>
Was it something that shocking?<br/>
How regrettable.<br/>
"Every, every day. First, I will write about Eric."<br/>
"... Y-Yes… That’s right. Every day… I am a bit<br/>
surprised. Even though the absolutely critical information would be written so<br/>
badly that it makes Regis sigh…"<br/>
"Ugh."<br/>
Altina averted her eyes.<br/>
She wasn’t bad at writing, but it was a pain<br/>
sitting in a chair and only getting to move your hands.<br/>
Eric bowed deeply.<br/>
"... Thank you very much… Your Highness, for<br/>
your concern… Just your words are enough to make me feel that it is wonderful<br/>
that I became a knight."<br/>
"Yes! And it’s not over! I have not given up! Be<br/>
it changing the Empire or your issue!"<br/>
Eric had a baffled face.<br/>
News of the Emperor’s passing probably haven’t<br/>
reach the fort yet, and Eric didn’t know about Latreille’s announcement on<br/>
taking the throne.<br/>
It couldn’t be helped since this was the<br/>
borders.<br/>
Altina sat straight on her chair again and<br/>
pondered for a moment.<br/>
"Errr… where should I start…"<br/>
At this moment, there was a knocking on the<br/>
door.<br/>
Who could it be? Eric muttered and stood up.<br/>
Altina finally let go of his hand.<br/>
With his right hand on the hilt, Eric opened the<br/>
door.<br/>
Standing at the corridor was Clarisse holding an<br/>
entire tea set on a tray.<br/>
She was smiling.<br/>
"It seemed that the conversation would take a<br/>
while. Would you like tea with sugar?"<br/>
"Eh… Ms Clarisse…"<br/>
Altina waved happily.<br/>
"Ahah, as expected of Clarisse! It’s just nice,<br/>
come join us. Let’s write the letter together!"<br/>
"Ara, you seem to be having a wonderful time."<br/>
Eric tilted his head.<br/>
"Is this okay? Didn’t Regis and ‘the Princess’<br/>
made a promise to write letters every day?"<br/>
"Ugh… I-It’s fine. Right? The most important<br/>
thing is to rely on your comrades. Challenging an opponent you have no hope of<br/>
winning and fighting on your own is a display of courage right?"<br/>
She raised a finger and said in Regis’ tone.<br/>
Eric and Clarisse looked at each other and<br/>
laughed.<br/>
Why are they laughing——!? Altina thought as she<br/>
pouted.<br/>
### Chapter 4<br/>
The Meeting of the Stars<br/>
"Bastian! I found a carriage!"<br/>
"Really!?"<br/>
He was just thinking that Elise was<br/>
uncharacteristically late in returning to the meeting point, when she appeared<br/>
with surprisingly great news..<br/>
Her blond hair swayed as she ran over.<br/>
She was really excited and out of breath.<br/>
"Hah, hah… There’s a carriage who would take<br/>
this route occasionally, he said he would go all the way to the capital!"<br/>
"Ohh! We finally found one!"<br/>
Bastian and Elise was in Wollallen city that was<br/>
30 Li away from the capital Versailles.<br/>
Because the High Britannia Army’s invasion route<br/>
cut across the middle of the Empire from west to east before heading north, this<br/>
city managed to avoid the ravages of war.<br/>
And that was why a lot of refugees who were<br/>
afraid of being implicated in the war escaped here.<br/>
Because all the rooms were full, a lot of people<br/>
set up camp at the edge of the city. Tentages were put up and covered with<br/>
cloth.<br/>
—— Why were Bastian and Elise in this city?<br/>
The Third Prince of Belgaria, Heinrich Trois<br/>
Bastian de Belgaria, kept his identity a secret and studied abroad in High<br/>
Britannia.<br/>
And Elise’s real name was Elizabeth Victoria.<br/>
Even though she was named the successor by the previous Queen, the new Queen<br/>
Margaret Steelart was after her life, so she was being pursued by the Royal Army.<br/>
After encountering all sorts of matters, Bastian<br/>
and Elise started moving together.<br/>
And then, two months ago——<br/>
The Kingdom of High Britannia declared war<br/>
against the Belgaria Empire.<br/>
The citizens were basking in the consecutive<br/>
victories, but after they received news that the ‘Queen’s Navy’ had been<br/>
defeated, news of further losses soon followed.<br/>
The names of the Fourth Princess Marie Quatre<br/>
Argentina de Belgaria and her strategist Regis d’Auric were famous in High<br/>
Britannia.<br/>
Under the gloom and tense atmosphere from losing<br/>
the war, public order in the cities deteriorated. The unreasonable persecution<br/>
towards Belgarians had reached dangerous levels.<br/>
That reason, and also the fact that he became a<br/>
wanted man made Bastian returned to the Belgaria empire.He also brought Elise<br/>
with him.<br/>
Originally, he was planning to travel with a<br/>
close friend —— Roland across the ocean.<br/>
However, in order to protect Bastian and Elise<br/>
from a bullet fired by a ruffian, Roland’s short life ended.<br/>
"I will entrust this to you… in order… for the<br/>
world to progress… into a place where everyone can pursue their… their own<br/>
happiness…"<br/>
"I promise! Leave it to me!"<br/>
The only thing left In the hands of Bastian who<br/>
fell into deep sadness, was Roland’s notebook.<br/>
They spent four days on the rocking sailship——<br/>
Passing through the surveillance network of the<br/>
High Britannia Royal Naval, they finally made it to a harbour city to the<br/>
southwest of the Belgaria Empire.<br/>
In this city, Bastian could only relay the<br/>
saddening news to the envoy from House Tiraso Laverde who came to receive<br/>
Roland.<br/>
Even though the envoy was saddened by the news,<br/>
he still offered shelter to Bastian and Elise.<br/>
However, there was a goal in Bastian’s heart.<br/>
It was just a vague feeling without any clear<br/>
direction, but he couldn’t hide in this place far away from the capital. That<br/>
was what his heart was telling him.<br/>
Bastian’s philosophy was to ‘do it immediately<br/>
when you think about it’.<br/>
After that, the two of them decided to head for<br/>
the capital.<br/>
Elise also bore the thought that ‘instead of<br/>
living helplessly in seclusion, it would be better to understand the situation<br/>
in the Empire’.<br/>
To be safe, they sent a message to the merchant<br/>
Marbella who was based in High Britannia through the Tiraso Laverde House.<br/>
Marbella saved the lives of Bastian and Elise,<br/>
and harboured them until he recovered. She even retrieved the ‘Ring of the<br/>
Royal Family’ that fell into the river.<br/>
And she thinks that Elise was the one who was<br/>
worthy of the throne, and promised to help in anyway she could.<br/>
We will definitely repay her kindness one day ——<br/>
The two of them thought.<br/>
But now wasn’t the time.<br/>
Bastian and Elise boarded the carriage heading<br/>
for the capital from the harbour city.<br/>
The weather was great so their journey proceeded<br/>
smoothly…<br/>
But when they reached Venomoth city, their<br/>
journey stopped.<br/>
It was understandable.<br/>
The region around the capital had become the<br/>
battlefield against the High Britannia Army. There was no telling how the<br/>
battle would end, so a lot of people had escaped here.<br/>
No one wanted to head there.<br/>
They couldn’t find any carriage that was willing<br/>
to go there. They searched all morning, and the sun was about to set.<br/>
Was there no other way but to go there on foot<br/>
—— As Bastian was thinking about that, Elise found a carriage that was willing<br/>
to head for the capital.<br/>
Bastian paid them three times the market price,<br/>
and boarded the carriage heading for the capital.<br/>
This is bad. The worst. Really the worst. Where<br/>
did we go wrong? When we allied with the lousy High Britannians? When we asked<br/>
to be the escort of the supply team? Or when we assaulted the home base of the<br/>
Fourth Army?<br/>
Things were going so well before…<br/>
My mood is so bad that even the best dishes<br/>
would be thrown onto the ground by me right now.<br/>
So in the end, the reason we failed is because I<br/>
didn’t kill the Belgarian Princess?<br/>
"... Damn it."<br/>
"... Fran?... Are you alright?"<br/>
As she was looking down and muttering, a<br/>
concerned voice rose beside her.<br/>
Franziska sighed.<br/>
"I’m always fine alright? Be it walking or<br/>
breathing. And also, being cute."<br/>
"... Oh. If you keep talking to the ground,<br/>
fairies will come out."<br/>
"I can’t see them anyway."<br/>
"Ara, then it’s better not to say too much, they<br/>
will suck away your life force."<br/>
"Ehhh!?"<br/>
"Look up when you are walking."<br/>
The woman who was talking with a serious<br/>
expression was her elder sister Jessica.<br/>
With her light coloured hair, pale skin and<br/>
slender limbs, she didn’t look like a mercenary at all.<br/>
But she was a member of the ‘Renard Pendu’,<br/>
known as the ‘Magician’.<br/>
The other person traveling with them was their<br/>
youngest sister Martina.<br/>
She was just ten years old, and looked younger<br/>
than other children of this age. Her ponytail on both sides of her head<br/>
resembled Franziska.<br/>
"Sister is cute——"<br/>
"Uwah~ alright alright! Martina is really cute<br/>
too~!"<br/>
Martina squinted her eyes because it felt itchy<br/>
when Franziska ruffled her head.<br/>
The three of them walked along the road on the<br/>
hilly region.<br/>
That night ——<br/>
Even though there wasn’t any rain, there was a<br/>
huge fog, and the advantage of the new rifles was gone.<br/>
The supply team was destroyed by the enemy<br/>
cavalry.<br/>
The moment the fog rose, Gilbert judged that it<br/>
was impossible to guard the supply team, and led all the elites of the ‘Renard<br/>
Pendu’ mercenary band to assault the enemy headquarters.<br/>
With a total of 16,000 men, even if the enemy<br/>
used half of their forces to attack, there would still be 8,000 men left in the<br/>
headquarters.<br/>
There were only 300 mercenaries.<br/>
It was a despairingly hopeless battle.<br/>
And of course, Franziska wanted to go too —— But<br/>
Gilbert ordered:<br/>
"You will escort the two of them to the<br/>
rendezvous point first."<br/>
"Why!? I can fight too!"<br/>
"Of course I know that! That’s why I gave you<br/>
this escort mission!"<br/>
He had an intimidating aura that wouldn’t take<br/>
no for an answer.<br/>
He was serious.<br/>
And there wasn’t time to debate.<br/>
Their mercenary comrades also showed smiles that<br/>
didn’t suit them.<br/>
"We will leave our ‘Magician’ to you,<br/>
Franziska."<br/>
"Protect your little sister too."<br/>
"We will return victorious soon, so prepare a<br/>
meal and wait for us!"<br/>
Don’t call my name without honorifics, I am not<br/>
your wife or your mother! Cook for you, are you kidding me!? I am only doing<br/>
this because it’s my brother’s orders!<br/>
She cursed as she saw them off.<br/>
Franziska knew that she won’t see many of her<br/>
comrades again.<br/>
But if it was Gilbert, he will make it work.<br/>
He will turn this despairing battle into<br/>
success.<br/>
She believed in him.<br/>
But reality wasn’t like a fairy tale.<br/>
—— The plan failed, and Gilbert was taken<br/>
prisoner.<br/>
‘Renard Pendu’ was wiped out.<br/>
Franziska brought the two of them and left the<br/>
rendezvous point.<br/>
And kept walking along the road.<br/>
Tracking the Imperial Fourth Army that captured<br/>
their brother Gilbert on foot.<br/>
Because an entire army was marching, there was<br/>
countless footprints and wheel tracks on the ground. To their left was a vast<br/>
forest.<br/>
Franziska sighed.<br/>
"... Well, it would be better to save them<br/>
soon."<br/>
Franziska thought that if she acted alone at<br/>
night, she could avoid the sentries and sneak to where Gilbert was held<br/>
captive.<br/>
If she could undo Gilbert’s bonds, he would be<br/>
able to rescue the other captured comrades. At the very least, they would be<br/>
able to escape.<br/>
But Jessica shook her head.<br/>
"... You will just lose your life."<br/>
She could prophesize the future by reading the<br/>
stars.<br/>
She also made the ‘unfavourable’ prediction for<br/>
this war.<br/>
That might be so, but the Germanian Federation<br/>
didn’t have any major civil war that required the service of ‘Renard Pendu’,<br/>
and the rewards offered by the High Britannia Kingdom was very enticing.<br/>
Jumping right into danger for their livelihood<br/>
was normal for mercenaries. Even now, Franziska didn’t think Gilbert’s original<br/>
judgement was wrong.<br/>
But ignoring Jessica’s prediction still spooked<br/>
her even now.<br/>
"Ughh… But, we are just tracking them from<br/>
behind. The army will reach the capital soon… Maybe big brother will…"<br/>
She heard that the Imperial Army would hang the<br/>
mercenaries they capture.<br/>
Gilbert might be executed at this very instant<br/>
—— Just thinking about that made Franziska lose her breath.<br/>
Martina looked worried.<br/>
Jessica looked towards the sky.<br/>
The sun was shining from the west onto their<br/>
backs, casting a long shadow onto the ground.<br/>
And of course, it was impossible to see the<br/>
stars at this time.<br/>
But she still muttered to herself:<br/>
"... It will be fine to follow this path."<br/>
"What did you say!?"<br/>
"... Follow big brother… That’s what the stars<br/>
are telling me."<br/>
"The stars during the day, and they are talking<br/>
to you!? Ahh, really! Divination and things like that are not to be trusted!"<br/>
"... This is astrology, a branch of study."<br/>
"Hah~"<br/>
"Cheer up, sister——"<br/>
"Only Martina can heal my heart."<br/>
"... Don’t worry, the Fourth Princess won’t<br/>
execute big brother."<br/>
"Why are you so certain? Did you ask the stars<br/>
again?"<br/>
"... If she wanted to, she would have killed him<br/>
the day they took him prisoner… The struggle for the throne between the Fourth<br/>
Princess and Second Prince is heating up, and the Princess is at a<br/>
disadvantage… She would need more strength."<br/>
Jessica wasn’t just proficient in astrology, she<br/>
also had the talent of a strategist.<br/>
That’s why Franziska fought off the urge to<br/>
infiltrate the Fourth Army’s camp despite her frustrations.<br/>
"... Hmm?"<br/>
They could hear the sound of horse hooves in<br/>
front of them.<br/>
Were it the Empire’s patrol? Franziska grew<br/>
tense as she thought about that.<br/>
At the same moment, the sound of horses<br/>
galloping approached from behind.<br/>
"Tch… Pincer attack!?"<br/>
Franziska loaded the crossbow on her waist and<br/>
held it at the ready.<br/>
"What?"<br/>
Jessica tilted her head.<br/>
Even though she could see the future, she was<br/>
slow to react to the crisis before her.<br/>
Army patrols won’t do a pincer attack on the<br/>
main road like this. It wasn’t a place where travelers and merchants loiter.<br/>
Franziska said with disgust.<br/>
"Bandits!"<br/>
"Ehh!?"<br/>
Martina was frightened but still reached for the<br/>
dagger at her waist. Despite being a child, she was still an apprentice<br/>
mercenary trained by the fierce ‘Renard Pendu’. She won’t lose to normal<br/>
soldiers.<br/>
But it would be another story if the enemy had<br/>
numbers.<br/>
The sound of the hooves suggested just that.<br/>
"Run into the wood!"<br/>
"... There are probably people hiding there."<br/>
When she heard that Franziska searched for signs<br/>
of them. But she couldn’t find any.<br/>
"Where are they!?"<br/>
"... If Franziska couldn’t find them, it would<br/>
be impossible for me right? But they really are there."<br/>
"Wait, this isn’t the time for jokes…!!"<br/>
They saw the people who rode in on horses from<br/>
both sides of the road.<br/>
As expected, they were bandits.<br/>
At this moment, Franziska understood who the<br/>
people emerging from the woods were.<br/>
She cursed in her heart.<br/>
—— This is the worst!<br/>
Like Jessica said, even the bandits foresaw that<br/>
their prey might run into the woods and set up an ambush there.<br/>
They didn’t have the right side.<br/>
But there was only hills as far as their eyes<br/>
could see.<br/>
Even if they ran there, they would be caught by<br/>
the horsemen in no time.<br/>
"Tch…"<br/>
There were less than 30 bandits. But it was a<br/>
large number to surround three women and children.<br/>
Franziska glanced at the enemy.<br/>
She didn’t have enough bolts.<br/>
—— Damn it damn it damn it, this is the worst!<br/>
The enemy was twice the number of her bolts.<br/>
If she was alone, Franziska just needed to<br/>
snatch a horse, then shoot to injure the horse of any pursuers.<br/>
But Jessica couldn’t ride a horse. Martina<br/>
wasn’t proficient, and was still in training.<br/>
"As expected, astrology is a sham… I will tell<br/>
big brother next time."<br/>
"... Isn’t this strange?"<br/>
"The thing that is strange is big sister’s<br/>
brain!"<br/>
The horses of the bandit neighed.<br/>
A bulky man riding a huge horse looked down at<br/>
them. He had a scar on his face, and looked like a veteran mercenary.<br/>
So this guy is the leader huh.<br/>
The bearded man breathed out foul air.<br/>
"Oh, so you are from ‘Renard Pendu’!"<br/>
"What!?"<br/>
They knew who we were!? Franziska widened her<br/>
eyes.<br/>
The leader smirked.<br/>
"When I was in the Germanian Federation, I was<br/>
in the same camp as you! I heard your famous band lost to the Empire, and my<br/>
patriotism pushed me to hunt down you lot. I hit the jackpot!"<br/>
His minions around him laughed sinisterly.<br/>
What patriotism! They are just beasts hunting<br/>
down the remnants of defeated mercenaries!<br/>
Franziska cursed at them in her heart.<br/>
But the situation was dire.<br/>
The enemy were mercenaries turned bandits,<br/>
numbered more than her bolts, and showed no signs of being careless despite<br/>
facing only women.<br/>
They hated the fame of ‘Renard Pendu’ that much…<br/>
Take the leader hostage?<br/>
No, they don’t seem to value the life of the<br/>
leader.<br/>
What if they attack Jessica and Martina in the<br/>
meantime?<br/>
Her back shivered.<br/>
An enemy readied his bow.<br/>
And the one he aimed at was Martina!?<br/>
"Stop!"<br/>
Franziska stood before Martina to protect her.<br/>
Laughter broke out among the bandits.<br/>
The leader rubbed his belly and said:<br/>
"Is that enough? There are archers behind you<br/>
too."<br/>
"Ughh!?"<br/>
A bandit behind her also nocked an arrow. He was<br/>
aiming at Martina too.<br/>
There were four bowmen in front, and three<br/>
behind!<br/>
She couldn’t defend!<br/>
If she was alone, Franziska was confident in<br/>
dodging the attacks and retaliate with her crossbow.<br/>
But before she could kill everyone —— No matter<br/>
what happens, Martina would be shot.<br/>
Her hands holding her crossbow shivered.<br/>
She didn’t make any large movement, but her<br/>
breathing was hard.<br/>
"Stop… Stop… Stop it! Don’t take my family from<br/>
me!"<br/>
"Are you kidding me, you mercenary! The soldiers<br/>
you killed have family too. Become our lunch here then!"<br/>
"Ughh…"<br/>
"Put your weapon down! I might spare your life<br/>
if you do that!"<br/>
"Ughh…"<br/>
Franziska teared up from her anger.<br/>
But she had no means of resisting.<br/>
She put her readied crossbow by her feet.<br/>
And raised both hands in surrender.<br/>
Her crying face spread to Martina.<br/>
S-Sister…"<br/>
"I’m sorry… Sorry… I… Big Brother asked me to<br/>
protect you… But I couldn’t do anything."<br/>
Jessica looked to the sky.<br/>
It was harder to tell how she felt from her<br/>
expression.<br/>
Even though she was known as the ‘Magician’, she<br/>
couldn’t come up with a way to turn the tide.<br/>
What would happen next? Become their minion? Or<br/>
sold to the Imperial Army? The leader snorted.<br/>
"Franz, next… take off your clothes."<br/>
"Hah!?"<br/>
"Well? You want me to kill you one by one?"<br/>
"... You bastard!"<br/>
This was the first time in Franziska’s life that<br/>
she felt such incredible bloodlust. Fireworks were blowing up in her brain.<br/>
The leader narrowed his eyes.<br/>
"Hey, shoot the smallest one."<br/>
His minion laughed happily and pulled his bow.<br/>
Martina screamed in terror.<br/>
Franziska could only roar angrily.<br/>
"Stop it!"<br/>
"You understand the position you are in,<br/>
mercenary? You get it now? Ahhh?"<br/>
"Ugh… Uuu… I, I know already!"<br/>
She removed her light armour.<br/>
It fell to the ground with a clank.<br/>
She removed the strings on her forearms.<br/>
And revealed her arms.<br/>
The gawking bandits felt disgusting.<br/>
I will shoot you through the eyeballs and kill<br/>
you —— Franziska swore.<br/>
She loosened the ribbons on her chest. The<br/>
strings on her back loosened too, and her clothes fell onto the ground.<br/>
After seeing Franziska in her underwear, the<br/>
bandits howled ferally.<br/>
Franziska felt a different sense of danger from<br/>
the battlefield, as if bugs were crawling towards her.<br/>
Her shoulders trembled.<br/>
She wasn’t sure if it was because of the shame<br/>
or her hate.<br/>
She could taste the blood from biting her lower<br/>
lips.<br/>
Jessica said slowly.<br/>
"... I am sorry… He came later than I expected."<br/>
"Hah?"<br/>
Franziska couldn’t spare the effort to<br/>
understand her vague words.<br/>
But even so, she regained her composure to<br/>
notice someone running in the woods.<br/>
—— What is that!?<br/>
That was someone who was faster than the<br/>
swiftest mercenary in ‘Renard Pendu’. It was hard to imagine that was a human.<br/>
That person didn’t fear about being surrounded<br/>
by bandits, and leapt right in.<br/>
A youth with brown hair ——<br/>
His eyes were crimson.<br/>
He looked about Franziska’s age, which was about<br/>
16.<br/>
But his movement was so fast that time in the<br/>
surrounding seemed to have stopped.<br/>
The bandits probably didn’t see because they<br/>
were laughing despicably as they watched Franziska took her clothes off —— They<br/>
finally noticed him when he stood before them.<br/>
The youth with brown hair and crimson eyes stood<br/>
beside Franziska.<br/>
The leader yelled.<br/>
"Kisama, who are you!?"<br/>
"I should be the one asking, what are the lot of<br/>
you doing? A group surrounding a girl and bullying her… I will listen to what<br/>
you have to say before beating all of you up, so explain yourself!"<br/>
Haha, the bandits laughed.<br/>
The leader rubbed his stomach.<br/>
"The reason? Because… We are bandits! Moron!<br/>
What can you do alone!? Are you here to die!?"<br/>
Franziska gritted her teeth.<br/>
She held hope for an instant when she saw his<br/>
incredible movements…<br/>
But the situation was still the same.<br/>
In the end, if they were shot from the front and<br/>
back, it would still end the same.<br/>
The other party knew too.<br/>
"Hey! Men are useless, kill him!"<br/>
After hearing the command of the leader, a<br/>
bandit notched an arrow.<br/>
"Puuahhh!?"<br/>
That bandit spew blood.<br/>
—— What happened!?<br/>
Most of the bandits couldn’t understand what was<br/>
happening despite it occurring right before their eyes.<br/>
Franziska could barely keep up. The youth beside<br/>
her seemed to have thrown something out.<br/>
In the chest of the bandit vomiting blood was a<br/>
fruit knife.<br/>
Throwing knife!?<br/>
Both the distance and speed was unusual.<br/>
The youth glared around him coldly.<br/>
"... I won’t hold back when protecting someone.<br/>
In order to keep others safe from murderers, I have the resolve to kill."<br/>
Instead of telling it to the bandits, he was<br/>
actually telling it to himself.<br/>
The leader yelled.<br/>
"Ugh… Don’t take us for fools! I will kill<br/>
you——!!"<br/>
As if they were kicked in the back by that<br/>
order, the bandits readied their bows.<br/>
Knives flew towards their chests.<br/>
The bandits who guarded their chest with their<br/>
arms were stabbed in the throat by a second knife.<br/>
As if he had grasped the movement of everyone on<br/>
scene. Even though it was a pincer attack——<br/>
The four men in front and three behind.<br/>
Before they could pull their bows, the youth had<br/>
thrown eight knives.<br/>
Even Franziska couldn’t keep up with his movement.<br/>
She wasn’t certain if her brother Gilbert or<br/>
Duke Balzac she fought in Fort Volks were that fast.<br/>
Knives were the fastest weapon of all, but that<br/>
was still very incredible.<br/>
Even though she was the one being saved,<br/>
Franziska couldn’t stop trembling.<br/>
But Franziska wasn’t a normal girl who could<br/>
only watch idly.<br/>
She kicked up the crossbow on the ground, and<br/>
pulled the trigger once she grabbed it.<br/>
A needle like bolt flew out.<br/>
Towards the head of the leader.<br/>
"Ahh!?"<br/>
Blood splattered.<br/>
The leader of the bandits flipped backwards off<br/>
the horse. With a bolt through his eye.<br/>
Franziska fulfilled her promise to herself.<br/>
The bandits screamed and started fleeing.<br/>
—— I will kill you all!<br/>
A second bolt was loaded.<br/>
But the bandits either escaped on horseback or<br/>
fled into the woods. As expected of bandits, they were fast in running away.<br/>
No one was left.<br/>
"Mister, thank you——!!"<br/>
A little girl suddenly hugged him.<br/>
"Uwaahhh!?"<br/>
Bastian panicked.<br/>
It was a surprise to be hugged so suddenly, but<br/>
being pounced on by such a young child was unexpected.<br/>
"Eheehee! I am Martina! What about you Mister!?"<br/>
"I am Bastian."<br/>
"Thank you Mister Bastian!"<br/>
"Are you hurt?"<br/>
"Nope!"<br/>
The young girl who was about Bastian’s age<br/>
lowered her head a little.<br/>
"... Erm… Thank… Thank you…"<br/>
Honestly speaking, Bastian didn’t know where to<br/>
look.<br/>
Judging from her skills with a crossbow, he<br/>
couldn’t let his guard down. But Bastian still felt too embarrassed to look at<br/>
her.<br/>
"Anyway, put on your clothes first."<br/>
"Ughh!? D-Don’t look here! Pervert! Even though<br/>
no one but big brother saw me like this before!"<br/>
"I am not thinking about that!?"<br/>
Seemed like there was no need to worry for now.<br/>
The girl picked up her clothes and tied her<br/>
ribbon frantically.<br/>
She wore her light armour with deft movements.<br/>
And then, the woman who seemed the oldest with a<br/>
calm aura bowed deeply.<br/>
"... My deepest thanks. I am Jessica."<br/>
"What a crisis to be surrounded by bandits."<br/>
"... That’s true, but thanks to that, we get to<br/>
meet Sir Bastian."<br/>
"Me?"<br/>
He tilted his head.<br/>
The girl who dressed herself as fast as she<br/>
could interrupted.<br/>
"Bastian huh!? You are running in the forest all<br/>
this while? Are you really human? That speed is too incredible right!?"<br/>
"Haha… I heard sound of horse trots when I was<br/>
traveling on the road in a carriage. To be safe, I move on ahead to check the<br/>
situation. I told them to catch up slowly, so they should be here now…"<br/>
He checked down the road, and saw a carriage<br/>
approaching.<br/>
It was the carriage they hired at Venomoth.<br/>
Elise leaned out from the cargo section and<br/>
waved.<br/>
When they reached, she didn’t wait for the<br/>
carriage to stop completely before jumping off and running over.<br/>
"Bastian!"<br/>
"Hey, that’s dangerous?"<br/>
"E-Erm… Who are they…!?"<br/>
"Actually, they were surrounded by bandits——"<br/>
Bastian recounted how he met them.<br/>
Jessica and Martina introduced themselves again,<br/>
Elise also introduced herself as ‘overseas student from High Britannia’.<br/>
Jessica said to the girl with crossbow.<br/>
"... Introduce yourself properly alright?"<br/>
"Ugh… I, I got it. Erm… I am Franziska!"<br/>
"I see. You are unhurt?"<br/>
"Sort off. But I was so angry that I could die."<br/>
"Ohh."<br/>
Jessica asked calmly:<br/>
"... Sir Bastian, where are you headed?"<br/>
"I plan to go around the battlefield and head<br/>
for the capital. I don’t know how the situation ahead is though."<br/>
"... Well, what a coincidence. We are heading<br/>
for the capital too."<br/>
"Sis!?"<br/>
Seeing Franziska so surprised, Jessica gave her<br/>
a look and didn’t say anything.<br/>
Bastian tilted his head.<br/>
"What’s the matter?"<br/>
"... Nothing, Franziska is just a little spooked<br/>
because we were just attacked by bandits."<br/>
"Ahh, I understand."<br/>
"... However, it is a little dangerous for three<br/>
woman to travel on their own. It would be great if a reliable man could<br/>
accompany us."<br/>
Jessica looked up at Bastian slightly.<br/>
Martina also looked up with her big eyes as if<br/>
she was expecting something.<br/>
Only Franziska was pouting, muttering ‘Ughh… He<br/>
saw me." with her cheeks red.<br/>
"Erm… What should we do?"<br/>
Bastian asked Elise.<br/>
She said matter of factly:<br/>
"It’s true that it’s dangerous for an all female<br/>
group traveling by themselves. The carriage is spacious, so it’s fine for them<br/>
to board!"<br/>
"Will it be a problem?"<br/>
"For the driver, the more passengers there are,<br/>
the merrier it is."<br/>
He asked to be safe and received the reply ——<br/>
It’s fine as long as you pay.<br/>
Jessica took out an unfamiliar currency.<br/>
"... Thaler silver coins?"<br/>
That seemed to be Germanian currency.<br/>
The driver agreed.<br/>
And so it turned out like this —— The trio also<br/>
boarded the carriage.<br/>
Bastian and Elise sat side by side at the right<br/>
side of the luggage compartment, while Jessica’s group sat on the left.<br/>
With a crack, the carriage moved again.<br/>
Bastian looked down the road.<br/>
"According to the driver, we will reach the<br/>
region that is probably a war zone in another day, so we will be making a<br/>
detour. We should reach the capital in another three days."<br/>
Jessica nodded.<br/>
Martina seemed to be sleepy because of fatigue.<br/>
Franziska seemed to be troubled and looked<br/>
sullen.<br/>
The carriage advanced slowly on the road.<br/>
The sun setted behind the hills to the west.<br/>
They started making camp before it was<br/>
completely dark.<br/>
It was great that they had the idea that more<br/>
would be better when they procured food.<br/>
Jessica asked Elise with her unchanging mask<br/>
like expression:<br/>
"... By the way… Why did you lie about being a<br/>
student studying abroad?"<br/>
