<br/>
Yes, it’s that time of month again. No, it’s not a period.<br/>
It’s payroll time (As an accountant, I am the one writing the payrolls.). ;–;<br/>
Days on Cal Mira Island<br/>
For the time being……We are travelling by ship.<br/>
It seems Firo has completely mastered swimming. When she swims she looks like a penguin.<br/>
Firo:"Master."<br/>
While floating in the water Firo grabs onto the reins for the boat that I am holding .<br/>
……I have a very bad feeling about this.<br/>
Firo:"Let Firo ferry the boat."<br/>
Naofumi:"Huh?"<br/>
While sitting on the boat with one hand on the oars, I think about the request.<br/>
Well, I understand what she is trying to do.<br/>
Naofumi:"Raphtalia, you don’t seem to be vomiting."<br/>
Raphtalia:"I am fine on boats!"<br/>
That’s a relief.<br/>
I nod and strongly shake the reins.<br/>
Firo:"Go~!"<br/>
Firo gallantly swims forwards while pulling the boat at high speeds.<br/>
Raphtalia:"Wa-Wa-Waaaaaah!"<br/>
As we were being ferried a funny voice was heard.<br/>
Well, it is normal to be surprised.<br/>
Raphtalia:" It’s just like a foreign Dophi Ship."<br/>
What’s that?<br/>
If I remember correctly, a Dophi is a demon that resembles a dolphin.<br/>
I can somehow imagine that.<br/>
Ships being pulled across the sea by large quantities of Dophi……I imagine it to be such a place.<br/>
We are being very efficient, since Firo is able to do it herself.<br/>
Or rather, does Firo even know where she is heading towards? ……In more ways than one.<br/>
Firo:"Where is the island?"<br/>
Raphtalia:"Over there."<br/>
After confirming where the island Firo is supposed to ferry us to, she changes the direction she is swimming in.<br/>
This fellow sure adapts quickly.<br/>
Firo:"Master~, next time we play, dive with Firo to the bottom of the sea, it’s very beautiful."<br/>
Naofumi:"I’ll suffocate."<br/>
How long and how fast can you dive for in the sea?<br/>
I would hate it. Coming to a different world, and drowning while playing in the sea.<br/>
Firo:"Onee-chan can dive for a long time, she won’t lose to Firo."<br/>
Naofumi:"Really?"<br/>
Raphtalia:"Y-Yeah…… Diving is my forte."<br/>
Well, if she couldn’t swim, her parents would not have pushed her into the sea, away from the demons when the wave happened.<br/>
Raphtalia:" Shall I fetch some seafood for later?"<br/>
Naofumi:"That’s fine….. But it always comes out at the hotel."<br/>
Raphtalia:"…….That seems be the case."<br/>
I’m getting slightly tired of seafood. Well, the dishes here are mostly in Meunière style, there is an absence of sashimi.<br/>
(Tlnote: Meunière: Rolled lightly in flour and sautéed in butter.)<br/>
Raphtalia:"Is it safe to eat it raw?"<br/>
Naofumi:"Dunno……"<br/>
Firo:"Is it delicious?"<br/>
Naofumi:"Let’s feed it to Firo and see."<br/>
The problem with feeding it to Firo is that there is still the possibility that it isn’t safe for us.<br/>
Naofumi:"Next time I’ll make some food from my world."<br/>
Firo:"Yay~!"<br/>
Raphtalia:"I’m looking forward to it."<br/>
Naofumi:"……Though it’ll probably be from the East."<br/>
A cook book would be something I would like to search for soon. Incidentaly, it also seems that my shield has a cooking skill.<br/>
And so, while chatting idly, we arrived at today’s destination surprisingly swiftly.<br/>
Well, we were able to see it from the start, it barely took us any time at all to get here.<br/>
Naofumi:"Th-That was surprising."<br/>
While getting off the boat, my legs were trembling, and I am having trouble standing.<br/>
Knowing the ridiculous speed that the boat travelled to its destination at is surprising.<br/>
Firo’s speed is quite considerable.<br/>
After arriving at the island, we comfortably move to the hunting grounds.<br/>
As a result, the experience points that demons give are increasing every time. Of course that’s excluding the Miraka Bracelet.<br/>
If equipped, the experience increased even more.<br/>
Anyway, for the time being since Raphtalia is the lowest level, she equips the bracelet first.<br/>
Raphtalia:"It’s been a while since I hunted demons with Naofumi-sama."<br/>
Naofumi:"Now that I think about it, that’s right."<br/>
Due to one thing or the other, from the fight against the pope all the way to Cal Mira Island, the only fighting that was done was from Firo.<br/>
Though I don’t think it has been that long either.<br/>
I mean…. when we were living as fugitives we had to hunt demons in order to procure food.<br/>
Naofumi:"From now on let’s level up together at this Cal Mira Archipelago. Do your best."<br/>
Raphtalia:"Okay!"<br/>
Firo:"Okay~!"<br/>
As we chatted and worked on raising our levels, we noticed that there were more people on Cal Mira Island than the day before.<br/>
As expected, the adventurers don’t really head towards the center of the island much.<br/>
Well, usually the upper limit for them is level 40. Unless they are a chosen adventurer it would be dangerous.<br/>
Though that might not be the reason I rarely met them……<br/>
Just that……How should I say it, those who are overly greedy will turn into bone……<br/>
I am reminded of the law survival of the fittest.<br/>
How many adventurers have died on this island?<br/>
I refrain from questioning it too much since they aren’t in the same class as us……<br/>
Raphtalia:"Tei!"<br/>
Firo:"Taaaaa!"<br/>
Demons are cut apart in a single one of Rapthalia’s sword strikes, and the demons that are kicked by Firo resemble meat paste.<br/>
……Correction, Raphtalia and Firo still have quite a lot to spare.<br/>
Furthermore, since I was strengthened, I can efficiently and safely defend against large numbers of demons.<br/>
Oh right, there is that Shield Bash.<br/>
Naofumi:"Shield Bash!"<br/>
I set my sights on an enemy, chant the skill to hit with my shield. Therefore, the demon was hit by the shield.<br/>
I watch as the Yellow Beetle is smashed……and I hear a nice smack.<br/>
Though, it didn’t seem to do very much damage.<br/>
However……Its movement stopped.<br/>
It seems to have been stunned for about three seconds.<br/>
This is a skill that inflicts an abnormal state called Stun or confusion.<br/>
Though it’s still a problem that i can’t do any damage……<br/>
Firo:"Bug~"<br/>
Some munching sounds resounded.<br/>
……During the opening that the yellow beetle shown when its movement stopped, it was pitifully finished off with Firo eating it.<br/>
Cool down time is 5 seconds. It is easy to use. Doesn’t cost much SP either.<br/>
(Tlnote: WHAT!? 3 second stun on a 5 second cooldown that doesn’t cost much SP? Can somebody yell: "NERF!"?)<br/>
As we approach the center of the island, the demons increase in levels, and Raphtalia was struggling slightly.<br/>
Naofumi:"Are you alright?"<br/>
Raphtalia:"There are no problems!"<br/>
Firo:"This is nothing~"<br/>
Well, by struggling I meant, instead of needing one attack, now it’s two.<br/>
So, at the center of today’s island, we encountered a Karma Dog Familiar.<br/>
Similar to a circular orb……A big dog with a pitch black body, had wings growing out from some magic-lens object from it’s back.<br/>
This breed of dog……similar to a Golden retriever? It’s an indescribably deformed demon. However, it doesn’t change that this is still a brutal demon.<br/>
I confirm the displayed name as Karma Dog.<br/>
Is it the boss of this island?<br/>
I can’t imagine the guy that summoned something like this Karma Dog Familiar as his familiar.<br/>
Naofumi:"Tzuvait ・Aura!"<br/>
I use support magic on Raphtalia and Firo who challange the Karma Dog.<br/>
The Karma dog tries to attack me by biting me with its enormous fangs.<br/>
Naofumi:"Hmph!"<br/>
The karma dog clamps down on my hand with its mouth, as I try to hold it down.<br/>
With a loud clang, I stop the movements of the Karma Dog.<br/>
Naofumi:"Shield Bash!"<br/>
I use one strike of Shield Bash on the Karma Dog.<br/>
If Raphtalia and Firo can take advantage of this opening it would be good.<br/>
And, contrary to what I thought, the Karma dog wasn’t showing any effects from the Abnormal state, does it have a resistance?<br/>
For just a moment, I felt the power of its bite weaken, but it seems to be recovering quickly.<br/>
Its movements are fast though, but thanks to me holding it down, we can fight it safely.<br/>
After defeating it, we are able to catch up since the experience gained is considerable.<br/>
And so our everyday life on the island continued as such.<br/>
The next day we defeated a Karma Squirrel. Of course, it included the Familiar.<br/>
During yesterday night I checked the skills included in the shields that I obtained.<br/>
It was quite fortunate that I got a skilled called Highten Reaction that informed me of any hostilities from demons.<br/>
I used it in the beginning in the hunting grounds.<br/>
Naofumi:" Highten Reaction!"<br/>
I tilt my neck, puzzled, as nothing happened. Then Firo blinks several times.<br/>
Firo:"Master, there’s a strange feeling of something flying around everywhere."<br/>
It was brought to my attention.<br/>
At first I didn’t understand what happened, but I immediately thought about it.<br/>
It was due to the swarm of demons aiming at me.<br/>
Of course, it included the ones that other adventurers that were fighting.<br/>
The effective range is about 15 meters.<br/>
As expected, I had to return their demons and apologize to the other adventurers for troubling them, during that time it came to light that I was the hero of the shield.<br/>
I had no intention of hiding it, but there are some obstinate guys that have a problem with me.<br/>
Still, Highten Reaction has no effect on demons that are above a certain level of intelligence.<br/>
Similarly we defeated a Karma Rabbit, and I absorb it into the shield.<br/>
Ah, it had a charm that was considered a good rare item. Of course, when a demon is defeated it will be dismantled before absorbing.<br/>
I wonder what principle they appear on? It’s quite likely that it could be from the dimensional crack.<br/>
And then, an ore called Oracle Ore dropped. After confirming the ore, it seems to be one of the necessary materials used to reinforce a weapon.<br/>
Therefore I started gathering it.<br/>
Since a weapon called Karma Dog Claw dropped, I took it out and gave it to Firo to equip.<br/>
……But it’s size didn’t fit. We were fighting against Karma Dogs for a while, and a larger sized one dropped so we finished without trouble.<br/>
Though the size is all over the place……Can’t anything be done about it?<br/>
Firo:"Master~ This is claw is ominous~"<br/>
Naofumi:"Don’t worry about it. It’s probably not particularly cursed."<br/>
Firo:"Though-…..When kicking, some black stuff sprays out and the demons become unappetizing. The enemies before were more tender~……"<br/>
Hmm……I wonder if it’s because the weapon has a darkness attribute. Do you want a different weapon to make your food with?<br/>
Naofumi:"How about you Raphtalia?"<br/>
A Karma Rabbit Sword dropped from a Karma Rabbit for Raphtalia.<br/>
Raphtalia:"For some reason my body has become very light, it is very peculiar."<br/>
Before coming to a different world, using weapons dropped from bosses would be very exciting, but for some reason it doesn’t seem so good.<br/>
I should probably ask the old man at the weapon shop to make weapons from the materials from the Karma bosses.<br/>
Well, it should be fine since the offensive power is good.<br/>
Though the bad point is that it doesn’t have blood clean coating, so the weapon won’t last a long time.<br/>
While staying at the hotel, I can make my shield a whetstone, and there are also a lot of other shields to go through.<br/>
Let’s give priority to that.<br/>
I should take the weapon to the old man for the coating……It is necessary to prepare for the next wave too.<br/>
It would be best for it to pass anti-climatically.<br/>
As our levels rise steadily, a sense of impending crises also rises.<br/>
For the time being, to combat the anxiety, I will continue to collect shields from new demons and open up more possibilities to deal with any problems.<br/>
I cannot do anything without being careful……<br/>
Well, should I check out the area where unknown demons inhabit after the wave……?<br/>
I have the queen’s funding so gold should be no problem.<br/>
Anyway, Including Raphtalia and Firo, we started strengthening ourselves.<br/>
<br/>
