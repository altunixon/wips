Chapter 41 <br/>
 <br/>
 <br/>
On our way north, we came across a town. <br/>
 <br/>
Naofumi: "What? There's a toll fee?" <br/>
 <br/>
The guards stopped us as we were about to enter the town and asked for a toll, so I showed them the note I received from the feudal lord of Forest village... <br/>
 <br/>
Guard: "These kinds of things aren't accepted! Pay quickly!" <br/>
Raphtalia: "But-" <br/>
 <br/>
The guard didn't even respond when Raphtalia tried to negotiate, only asking for gold. <br/>
Despite all that negotiating, the guard held his ground. <br/>
 <br/>
Naofumi: "What a stubborn bastard!" <br/>
 <br/>
Even though the guard looked like he was going to rush us, he stood there and just glared at me with hostility. <br/>
Hmm... Something must have happened here. <br/>
After I started peddling in this world, I learned a few things. <br/>
No one would perform such unreasonable extortion unless they had strong backup. <br/>
 <br/>
It seems whoever this person works with is powerful. <br/>
It seems we have to call this guy's partner to negotiate, we'll have to discuss about human relations. <br/>
It'll only work if his partner is not hostile though. <br/>
As for why this guy's partner isn't here, there are a few reasons... <br/>
 <br/>
Naofumi: "The Feudal lord here must be an outrageous bastard." <br/>
 <br/>
I muttered while looking at the town. The guard's expression changes upon hearing that. <br/>
 <br/>
Guard: "Don’t you dare speak ill of the lord! Or else I will punish you!" <br/>
 <br/>
Ah I see. So it's a problem with the top dog. In this case, neither threats nor negotiations will be effective. <br/>
The road is closed so I can't pass. There will be punishment if caught. <br/>
Maybe if I make enough of a commotion for the lord to appear. <br/>
However, there is little reward for such a risk... <br/>
 <br/>
Naofumi: "I understand. You guys have it tough too..." <br/>
 <br/>
I hand the amount asked to the guard. <br/>
The guard looked a little shocked. <br/>
 <br/>
Guard: "Yeah... This is good" <br/>
 <br/>
The guard whispered to me. <br/>
 <br/>
Guard: "I'm sorry..." <br/>
Naofumi: "It can't be helped." <br/>
 <br/>
Is this in the jurisdiction of that trash king? Or is this country's feudal lord also rotten. <br/>
I intended to sell the food loaded in my carts, but I stopped when they collected tax. <br/>
 <br/>
The inn seems to be fairly high class, at least when compared to the neighbourhood. <br/>
Everything in this town seems to be taxed: daily necessities, food, weapons, armour, crafted goods and even the hotel fee. Everything is expensive. <br/>
Living here must be hard. <br/>
 <br/>
The commerce is totally in decline and the markets aren't lively at all. <br/>
The unreasonably heavy taxation must have taken its toll. <br/>
 <br/>
Naofumi: "Collect information on the village that's short on food" <br/>
Raphtalia: "Understood" <br/>
Firo: "Okay~! Master I want a souvenir~" <br/>
Naofumi: "You eat so much food and you still want more?" <br/>
 <br/>
This Firo, demanding a souvenir despite the high prices... <br/>
We head to the bar with Firo in her human form. <br/>
By the way, I changed my shield to the Book Shield. <br/>
 <br/>
There, I saw a fellow who I would rather not have encountered. <br/>
 <br/>
"Fellow": "It seems that way" <br/>
 <br/>
Although he has a bow, there is also a sword on his waist, his equipments also seems to be of low quality. <br/>
Similar to my Book Shield as camouflage, the bow is small and plain. <br/>
If this was our first meeting and if he wore a glove, I wouldn't have known him. <br/>
But, his companion was dressed in very conspicuous colours. It looks like he's trying to hide himself. Probably. <br/>
 <br/>
That's right, the hero of the Bow is having a discussion in the corner of the bar. <br/>
 <br/>
He doesn't seem to have noticed me. <br/>
What are they talking about? I'll get closer and concentrate on listening… <br/>
 <br/>
Villager: "The lord here..." <br/>
 <br/>
Apparently, they are gathering information about the lord's notoriety. <br/>
According to the story, he fill his own pocket with the raised tax money, accept bribes from merchants and employed bodyguards to severely punish anyone who object <br/>
It seems this feudal lord is also trash. <br/>
 <br/>
Itsuki: "That's overboard, I must punish him." <br/>
 <br/>
Whoops! <br/>
I almost fell over when I heard Itsuki's dangerous line. <br/>
First off, how am I supposed to respond to that...? <br/>
What are you trying to do staying concealed anyway, what kind of shogun are you? <br/>
Are you going to leave right after the revolution? <br/>
 <br/>
Didn't I hear some rumours similar to this about the Hero of the Bow? <br/>
In hind sight, rumours aren't really reliable since I am known as the saint of the holy bird. But I am almost known as the nefarious Hero of the Shield. <br/>
Because nobody knows my real identity, I can still get by pretending to be a saint. <br/>
As for the reason why Itsuki is hiding, I do not know. <br/>
For example... Is the country asking him to hide? <br/>
I can't really speculate due to lack of information on Itsuki. <br/>
There's little to nothing on the Hero of the Bow either. <br/>
Are you hiding intentionally...? <br/>
 <br/>
Itsuki: "Everyone, let’s go." <br/>
 <br/>
Itsuki finished his talk, left the bar, and disappeared into the night. <br/>
The next morning, the feudal lord was removed… <br/>
After making a mess of the feudal lord's mansion, Itsuki's subordinates revealed themselves to start preaching. <br/>
The trash king heard about it, and in the end, the Lordship was transferred to another person. <br/>
I am reminded of dramas about olden times and a journey of revolutions. <br/>
 <br/>
Are they retarded…? <br/>
 <br/>
This is too troublesome to be involved in. <br/>
I returned to the hotel after looking for what I originally came for, information on the village that wants to buy food. <br/>
Firo's souvenir? There’s no way I'll buy something like that in such an expensive town. <br/>
I just read my magic book and ignored Firo who seemed to be complaining to me about something. <br/>
I learned another spell. <br/>
What the aunty from the magic shop told me about the Hero of the shield being good at using support and healing magic seems to be true... <br/>
 <br/>
Next morning. <br/>
As I expected, adventurers hired by the country are secretly investigating the town, stories about how the lord lost power are everywhere. <br/>
In the middle of the town, I see Itsuki engaging in small talk with a beautiful girl. <br/>
 <br/>
Girl: "Really, thank you very much." <br/>
Itsuki: "There is no such thing. Its secret you know." <br/>
 <br/>
That's a secret my ass. <br/>
 <br/>
Yup. <br/>
 <br/>
My suspicion has been confirmed. <br/>
Now I know why there are no rumours of Itsuki. <br/>
This guy is pretending to hide himself and creating the image of being humble. <br/>
And rejoices when people "finds out" and confront him about it, what an unpleasant hobby. <br/>
 <br/>
That guy's retarded. <br/>
 <br/>
Hiding your true identity to satisfy your "superhero unmasking for the public" desires, truly obnoxious.  <br/>
Otherwise, you wouldn't be chatting in such a conspicuous place. <br/>
At least I understand the reason she would be indebted to such a guy. <br/>
It seems she was almost taken away due to being unable to pay the tax and she has to take care of a bedridden old man. <br/>
This is ridiculous. We left the town at a quick pace. <br/>
 <br/>
After travelling for half a day, we reached the village bordering a neighbouring country. <br/>
It seems that all the food that wasn't sold yesterday is in high demand. Apparently the entire region is in famine. <br/>
However, it looks like there are a lot of guys that aren't residents of this village. <br/>
Their clothes don't seem to be from this country. <br/>
 <br/>
Naofumi: "Hey. You over there..." <br/>
 <br/>
It seems they are from the neighbouring country where their tyrant of a king was exterminated. <br/>
Are they here to peddle? <br/>
After they looked into my carriage, they came to have a talk about business. <br/>
They don't seem to have money so maybe they'll try to barter. Their medical herbs are good and maybe some lumber for woodworking... <br/>
I got off the carriage and asked about their circumstances. <br/>
 <br/>
Villager: "Thanks for saving us money" <br/>
 <br/>
Even if I am handed string or coal, as long as I acquire enough, it will be useful. <br/>
Though I only traded because they had a nice amount of medical herbs. <br/>
 <br/>
Villager: "I'm sorry. For a while now, there has been little to sell......" <br/>
 <br/>
If I look closely, he resembles a thin twig, seems like he'll die at any moment. <br/>
 <br/>
Naofumi: "…Here's a little gift. Although it's not much, eat it sparingly." <br/>
 <br/>
Because it can't be helped, I borrowed a large pan from the group of villagers. <br/>
The village suffering from starvation cooperates willingly. <br/>
There's many things that are about to rot. Give or take 4 days until they go bad. <br/>
That’s even after I got the skill Anti-corruption which delays rotting. <br/>
 <br/>
Villager: "Thank you very much!" <br/>
 <br/>
They hungrily devoured everything I made in the pan. <br/>
Meanwhile, I inquired why this is happening. <br/>
It seems that regardless of whether or not the king was a tyrant, life was fine. <br/>
Taxes weren't too high, and some people even took it easy. <br/>
But it seems that was over soon. <br/>
It seems that the known as the Resistance that took over, they increased the taxes. <br/>
 <br/>
Naofumi: "What? Didn’t you guys overthrow the evil king?" <br/>
Villager: "......Money is required to properly administer a country, hence taxes were raised, and military power was also reduced due to cost." <br/>
 <br/>
Indeed, rather than the king being bad, it is folly to not even keep a minimum amount of military power in order to defend the country. <br/>
It is said that it is not a country without its people, but what do you say about a country that cannot protect its people? <br/>
 <br/>
It seems only bad rumours of the king were being spread. <br/>
I don't know what the king was thinking but, I feel a strange sense of camaraderie with the king that was labelled as a tyrant. <br/>
Something could have been done if the king was negotiated with instead of being exterminated. <br/>
 <br/>
As for the trash king in this country, he's been evil since the beginning. <br/>
 <br/>
Villager: "Only the head changed and it's becoming impossible to live. So we bring what little wealth we have into this Melromarc country and try to live." <br/>
 <br/>
Firo: "I feel sorry for your king~! I wish everyone the best. Anyway, I'm hungry so who do I blame?" <br/>
Naofumi: "Shut up you bird! My spirit as the owner will be doubted!" <br/>
Firo: "Okay~" <br/>
 <br/>
I scolded Firo for opening another's wounds. <br/>
It seems recently she has become unable to read the atmosphere, and has become foul-mouthed. <br/>
 <br/>
Raphtalia: "I wonder who she is learning from..." <br/>
 <br/>
Raphtalia watched and commented under her breath. <br/>
 <br/>
Naofumi:"Did you say something?" <br/>
Raphtalia: "Nope, absolutely nothing..." <br/>
 <br/>
It seems Itsuki took part in the Resistance. He might have been bad behind it since the beginning. <br/>
Anyway, are these people entering this country illegally to buy black-market food? <br/>
It seems the prices of food have sky-rocketed in this area. And I can just rake it in. <br/>
 <br/>
If I'm not mistaken, Itsuki...Shogun-sama has done some reforms around this area. <br/>
Though the after service sucks... <br/>
Because his sense of justice was satisfied, he moved on. <br/>
 <br/>
Villager: "Although this nation could attack our country as it is weakening, it is simply impossible to live during a famine..." <br/>
Naofumi: "Hmm I see..." <br/>
 <br/>
The wave may also be influencing famines. <br/>
 <br/>
Villager: "This is?" <br/>
Naofumi: "This is a remodelled plant that was causing trouble down south of this country, I modified it with a special technique so that it will grow when planted. It will probably be okay, but pay attention to managing it. If it is handled carelessly, it could be dangerous." <br/>
Villager: "O-Okay......" <br/>
Naofumi: "I'll be around this neighbourhood again in the future. You can thank me then." <br/>
 <br/>
Because the three carts were sold completely, I gave two seeds as a bonus. <br/>
As for what will happen to the village? That's a different story. <br/>
 <br/>
It seems that my true identity was revealed, but because the small neighbouring country was saved from famine, the residents weren't bothered by it. <br/>
Additionally, due to the large amount of medical herbs acquired here, it seems an epidemic was prevented in the east district after we decided to sell there.
