Anouncement: Due to exams (I’m a high school student) I won’t be translating for the first half of January<br/>
Also, I think this is what 212 was referring to<br/>
<br/>
From Yuru Yuri<br/>
Chapter 211: Infighting<br/>
"As expected of Firo-tan. My heart is beating so fast my chest will split open…" (Motoyasu)<br/>
Even though Motoyasu was kicked, he’s showing an expression of ecstasy as he gets up.<br/>
How long will this headache continue?<br/>
And from the sound, it didn’t seem like Firo held back at all with that Kick.<br/>
It was a serious kick, and she’s also receiving a bonus from the Lust Spear. My Zveit Aura should also still be in effect… Yet he withstood that.<br/>
The past Motoyasu would have been split in half. Even the Curse Series shouldn’t increase his stats to this extent.<br/>
I don’t know why, but he’s still doing just fine.<br/>
"Motoyasu-" (Naofumi)<br/>
"WHAT is it, FAther?" (Motoyasu)<br/>
(TL: Motoyasu is randomly switching between Hiragana and Katakana here.)<br/>
"… Never mind… Have you been trying out other reinforcement methods?" (Naofumi)<br/>
"YES Firo-taN’s fATHEr’s words are absolUTE." (Motoyasu)<br/>
… I don’t need your imitation!<br/>
So this idiot finally began using the strengthening methods I passed to Shadow.<br/>
The result… The current Motoyasu is probably stronger than me.<br/>
My Wrath hasn’t been enhanced much, and it’s only at level III.<br/>
Motoyasu is at IV. His weapon’s definitely stronger.<br/>
If I make an enemy of him, will I lose?<br/>
What should I do in this situation?<br/>
Firo is putting up an amazing fight.<br/>
And he’s counteracting with the boost of his curse skills.<br/>
… Isn’t this bad? Motoyasu probably won’t fight Firo seriously.<br/>
But Firo is coming at him with all of her might.<br/>
Right now Motoyasu hasn’t taken too much damage, but if Firo continues like this things may get ugly.<br/>
After that, Firo will, without a doubt, come after me.<br/>
If Motoyasu fights to the death, we may have a chance, but we’ve been told that killing heroes is bad.<br/>
If possible, I wasn’t to avoid that.<br/>
"Hah… Hah…n…" (Firo)<br/>
Firo takes an offensive stance.<br/>
This stance is…<br/>
Magic power begins swirling around her center of gravity. The current me can see it.<br/>
I think this is the stance to recover mana.<br/>
But in this situation, it probably isn’t replenishment, but amplification.<br/>
"Reach Firo-tan! My feelings!" (Motoyasu)<br/>
Motoyasu sees this as an opportunity to attack.<br/>
But…<br/>
Firo’s magic replenishment finishes much faster than I expected.<br/>
「High Quick!」 (Firo)<br/>
There’s a flash!<br/>
A white afterimage passes through Motoyasu’s body. The sight of a white ribbon continuously piercing through Motoyasu’s body is burned into my eyes.<br/>
"Gufu…" (Motoyasu)<br/>
M-Motoyasu! Could he be done already!?<br/>
"Amazing. Firo-tan!" (Motoyasu)<br/>
Ah. He got up.<br/>
That’s good. The meat shield protecting me is still alive.<br/>
"Um… Should we be doing anything?" (Atlas)<br/>
"You want to go into that battlefield? It’ll be dangerous even for me, you know." (Naofumi)<br/>
"Right…" (Atlas)<br/>
But should we really just stay on the sidelines?<br/>
I should probably look for a way to escape…<br/>
"Rishia, try to run!" (Naofumi)<br/>
I order Rishia to try running alone.<br/>
"Fue!?" (Rishia)<br/>
"Naofumi?" (Melty)<br/>
"Now! Quickly!" (Naofumi)<br/>
"Yes, Naofumi-sama is saying it, so Rishia-san, please run!" (Atlas)<br/>
"Y-yes!" (Rishia)<br/>
Upon Atlas’s recommendation, Rishia begins running away.<br/>
But… she soon returns.<br/>
"Fueeee! Why am I back here!?" (Rishia)<br/>
As I thought. We’re in something like a special loop.<br/>
It seems we’ll be unable to escape for a while.<br/>
Motoyasu and Firo are still fighting.<br/>
I’m grasping for the means to do something, but I can’t think of anything.<br/>
I just hope that the two forces will collapse simultaneously.<br/>
But the situation is heading in a negative direction.<br/>
"Diiiiee-!" (Filo Rials)<br/>
Motoyasu’s three subordinate Filo Rials begin attacking Firo.<br/>
"W-why is everyone-!?" (Motoyasu)<br/>
Motoyasu stands in front to protect Firo.<br/>
But the Filo Rials continue their assault, one with a kick, another with magic, and the last one with a battle axe.<br/>
The one who kicked was Red, the one who cast was Blue and the one rushing with an axe on their shoulder is Green.<br/>
All of them have strange looks in their eyes.<br/>
"Hate… The one who monopolizes Mokkun’s love, while seducing another man. I hate you!" (Filo Rial)<br/>
"Mo-kun is ours…" (Filo Rial)<br/>
"Yeah… I won’t approve of that person!" (Filo Rial)<br/>
"S-stop! Everyone!" (Motoyasu)<br/>
"""I Want to be the one to eat Mo-kun (Mokkun)! And that bitch is in the way!""" (Filo Rials)<br/>
To protect Firo. Motoyasu begins fighting the three.<br/>
Though not as fast as Firo, they are still quite fast.<br/>
"Atlas." (Naofumi)<br/>
"Yes, something black is wrapped around those three. It’s more potent than with Firo-chan." (Atlas)<br/>
"Ah, I see." (Naofumi)<br/>
From what I see, they have yet to Class Up.<br/>
The fact that they are able to hold off Motoyasu must be due to his own support.<br/>
I mean, they’re clearly being effected by his Curse Series.<br/>
Lust and Envy.<br/>
Like Firo, Lust is putting them in heat, and Envy is making them attack Firo.<br/>
With those three on the offense, Motoyasu has no choice but to defend her.<br/>
But they’re his precious daughters. I don’t think he can hurt them.<br/>
Motoyasu is protecting Firo. Firo is approaching me with a dangerous aura. The three Filo Rials are trying to kill her.<br/>
It may be my imagination, but originally, Motoyasu was the enemy, Firo was an ally, and the Filo Rials were Motoyasu’s subordinates, and by transitive property, were enemies.<br/>
In reality, Motoyasu is now an ally(?), Firo is an Enemy, and the three are… A third power?<br/>
I’m starting to have a hard time differentiating friend and foe.<br/>
And then…<br/>
"Master… Finally the nuisance is gone…" (Firo)<br/>
With her back to Motoyasu, Firo begins walking towards me, step by step.<br/>
I’ve had a long time to think, so I have a few plans to test out.<br/>
Among them should be one that should be able to handle this situation.<br/>
Idea 1: Activate the Wrath Shield and turn everything to ash.<br/>
Con: The wrath shield hasn’t been strengthened, so the fire power may be lacking.<br/>
It will be difficult to beat Firo with it. Even including Iron Maiden and Blutopfer.<br/>
I can’t even use the latter. Even if I get the chance, the chances of it hitting Firo are low. And if it did hit, Firo would die.<br/>
Idea 2: Use idea 1 to take out Motoyasu.<br/>
Con: I don’t have enough information on the current Motoyasu to take him on with certainty.<br/>
I also don’t know the exact effects of his skills.<br/>
Idea 3: Talk to and convince Motoyasu.<br/>
Con: There’s no precedent showing he can even be reasoned with. To get him to agree, I may have to have Firo talk to him.<br/>
But with Firo like this, I can’t really do that.<br/>
Idea 4: Talk to and convince Firo.<br/>
Con: She’s not in a state where words will reach her. Convincing her seems impossible. I don’t think she’ll agree to anything I ask of her.<br/>
Idea 5: Cast support on Motoyasu’s followers and have them take care of everything.<br/>
Con: Firo will get killed. I want to avoid that.<br/>
This is no good.<br/>
Even taking an uncertain gamble is better than these options.<br/>
I wondered about the power of a Wrath Shield reinforced Shield prison and E Float Shield.<br/>
My personal defense is very high, but I wasn’t sure about external attachments.<br/>
And so I experimented with infusing these items with Magic.<br/>
But… in order to make them succeed…<br/>
"Master~…" (Firo)<br/>
I’m going to be defiled!<br/>
That is…<br/>
"A-at least in human form!" (Naofumi)<br/>
What the hell am I saying!?<br/>
But being violated by a little girl has to be better than being violated by a giant bird.<br/>
"No." (Firo)<br/>
Ku… That’s a nostalgic line from Firo.<br/>
When we first taught her to speak, Firo repeated that word over and over.<br/>
So I’m going to be defiled by a giant bird. I would rather die.<br/>
Motoyasu may be delighted with this, but this is not my fetish!<br/>
I have to restrain Firo no matter what.<br/>
「Shield-」 (Naofumi)<br/>
I feel the flow of energy all around my body.<br/>
My desperation, my desire to succeed in this no matter what, makes my mind move faster. I begin to understand this power.<br/>
This is… Not Magic. Is it… the Chi that Atlas senses?<br/>
No, this power surfaced when I was about to activate Shield Prison.<br/>
This is probably the phenomenon known as SP.<br/>
「Pri-」 (Naofumi)<br/>
I feel the power flowing towards my designated target.<br/>
I see… Is that the point where I have to send my magic?<br/>
I get the feeling that I can do it.<br/>
But I don’t have time. Before I cast it, I cut it off.<br/>
「…」 (Naofumi)<br/>
The power flowing out returns to my body.<br/>
But there is something that surprises me even more.<br/>
When I was about to release it, Firo jumped away from the point that I targeted.<br/>
Did her instincts tell her to avoid it?<br/>
So even if I successfully infuse it with magic, Firo will avoid it.<br/>
I’m doing this without any practice. And it requires a lot of concentration to infuse the magic. And now I find that It probably won’t even hit her.<br/>
I don’t have any more options. I could try using this power to strengthen the Meteor Shield, but it’s still cooling down.<br/>
But… If I give up here, my purity…!<br/>
Perhaps I should shift my target to Motoyasu?<br/>
