Boy that was an annoying chapter, I fucking hate explanations...... <br/>
Oh well.  <br/>
 <br/>
Chapter 35 <br/>
 <br/>
Naofumi: "Hm?" <br/>
 <br/>
About an hour before arriving at the next village, I heard a strange sound while working in the carriage. <br/>
There are wheezing sounds coming from a carriage next to ours. When I look outside, I saw a man with an impatient expression on his face, holding onto a bag. <br/>
 <br/>
Naofumi: "What's the rush?" <br/>
 <br/>
The key to being proficient in business is the ability to act curious. <br/>
 <br/>
Naofumi: "Hey, you over there, what’s wrong?" <br/>
Villager: "I need to return to the village on the other side of the mountain quickly." <br/>
Naofumi: "Why are you in such a rush to return to the village over there?" <br/>
 <br/>
The man wanted to buy medicine for his parents but Firo ran past him. <br/>
 <br/>
Villager: "Yes, every second counts." <br/>
 <br/>
I understand the circumstances of this man who caught up to my carriage. <br/>
Hmm...The cost of getting to the other side of the mountain should be around 50 coppers. <br/>
 <br/>
Naofumi: "Firo, how fast can you get there if you go at top speed?" <br/>
Firo: "Uhmm, let's see… If I were to run without pulling the carriage we would arrive quickly." <br/>
Naofumi: "Understood." <br/>
 <br/>
I glanced at Raphtalia who read my mind and nodded. <br/>
 <br/>
Naofumi: "I'll take you there for 1 silver is that fine?" <br/>
Villager: "Eh!?" <br/>
 <br/>
The man has a shocked expression. <br/>
 <br/>
Villager: "I just bought medicine, I don't have any more money..." <br/>
Naofumi: "One silver is already cheap you know? You can repay me with medical herbs when we get there. That's my final offer." <br/>
Villager: "In that case......" <br/>
Naofumi: "Alright it's done. Firo!" <br/>
Firo: "Okay~!" <br/>
 <br/>
Firo leaves the carriage on the side of the road and turns around. <br/>
I pick up the man and put him in the wagon on Firo's back. <br/>
 <br/>
Villager: "Uwah!" <br/>
 <br/>
Firo carries the wagon with both hands and dashed at full speed. <br/>
Raphtalia is waving away from the carriage. <br/>
 <br/>
Firo: "I'm leaving!" <br/>
Villager?: "Oh!" <br/>
 <br/>
Dotadotadota! <br/>
When Firo runs seriously, she is two times faster than an average Philorial. <br/>
We arrived at the man's house in the village across a mountain in no time. <br/>
 <br/>
Villager: "What frightening speed......" <br/>
Naofumi: "Don't you need to give your parent the medicine? Don't drop it." <br/>
Villager: "Oh, right!" <br/>
 <br/>
The man enters the house. I enter after him as I have yet to receive my compensation. <br/>
It is a very normal house in a farming village. <br/>
I heard coughing sounds as I stepped inside. <br/>
 <br/>
Villager: "Mom, I brought medicine. Endure it and drink." <br/>
 <br/>
As I walked towards the voice, I saw a pale old woman who looks as if she is about to die at any time. <br/>
What medicine is that, the effects seem greater than any I know. <br/>
Hm... <br/>
 <br/>
Naofumi: "Hey. Before you let her drink it, boil it in hot water first." <br/>
Villager: "Is that ok?" <br/>
Naofumi: "Pass me the medicine" <br/>
 <br/>
I received the medicine from the man and fed it to the old woman while rubbing her back. <br/>
The skill Medical effect Up seems to be working. <br/>
 <br/>
Old woman: "Cough...... Cough......" <br/>
 <br/>
The old woman somehow managed to finish the medicine. <br/>
In my eyes, I can see some light scattering. <br/>
Apparently it was pretty effective. <br/>
The old woman's condition seems to have improved by leaps and bounds. Some redness returned to her complexion and her coughing has decreased. <br/>
 <br/>
Naofumi: "You should rest for a while. Your son will bring you food immediately." <br/>
 <br/>
The old woman looks up at me while trembling. <br/>
 <br/>
Naofumi: "Now then." <br/>
 <br/>
I leave for the kitchen where the man is. <br/>
 <br/>
Villager : "Oh, did she drink it properly?" <br/>
Naofumi: "Yeah, her condition seems to have stabilised as well." <br/>
 <br/>
The man's shoulders sag in relief at my answer. <br/>
 <br/>
Naofumi: "You can pay me later." <br/>
Villager: "Okay" <br/>
 <br/>
I leave the house and head to where Firo is waiting. <br/>
Before we leave the village, the man's expression becomes tense. <br/>
 <br/>
Villager: "Um..." <br/>
Naofumi: "What’s up?" <br/>
 <br/>
I answered the man while packing up peddling goods. <br/>
 <br/>
Villager: "Because of you, mother's complexion has improved remarkably." <br/>
Naofumi: "It’s not necessary for you to thank me." <br/>
 <br/>
I have a bad reputation, so if people hear this, they will be doubtful. <br/>
 <br/>
Villager: "At least tell me your name." <br/>
Naofumi: "I have no reason to tell you. The medicine did all the work. Now, bring a silver piece or some suitable herbs." <br/>
Villager: "O-okay!" <br/>
 <br/>
The man brought some items and some food from his house and gave it to me. <br/>
 <br/>
Naofumi: "Thanks, best regards and see you later." <br/>
Villager: "Thank you very much!" <br/>
 <br/>
The man seems to be a lot more cheerful. <br/>
As a side note, on my next visit, the old woman seems to have become very energetic... Maybe a little bit too energetic for an old woman. <br/>
 <br/>
I got back on the wagon as we return and begin compounding medicine while translating the intermediate recipe book. <br/>
The intermediate recipe book seems to be easier to translate than the magic book. <br/>
I was exhausted after being able to barely translate a treatment potion. <br/>
I've gotten pretty far. <br/>
Various things have happened in this past month, I wonder if I can meet my brother some time… <br/>
(tl note: He has a brother? or is it just my shit translations? "ここ一ヶ月色々あって忘れていたが、もしも生きて弟に会えたら何か言ってやるのも良いかもしれな い") <br/>
 <br/>
Raphtalia: "Naofumi-sama, I've finished selling items." <br/>
 <br/>
We arrived at the village sometime in between evening and afternoon. <br/>
 <br/>
Naofumi: "Can you take this baggage and letter to the next village?" <br/>
Raphtalia: "Sure" <br/>
 <br/>
I get off the carriage and load the baggage. <br/>
This luggage must not be worth much to trust an unknown peddler with it. <br/>
Since it might be stolen, it should be full of cheap things. <br/>
Well, it's not my problem since I can earn some pocket change. <br/>
I continue from village to village, town to town in this manner. <br/>
If I feed someone medicine directly, it seems the effects do improve. <br/>
After two weeks, I've become famous for being a peddler with a rare demon. <br/>
As my credibility increases, customers who want a ride also increase. <br/>
I've been saving up money slowly. <br/>
There's some merit in being a travelling peddler. <br/>
First is being able to sell medicine smoothly. <br/>
Then, any demons that were defeated on the way were absorbed, increasing my stats. <br/>
On this trip, I found out that every region has different demons. <br/>
As a result of peddling, my shield seems to be getting stronger. <br/>
 <br/>
I also overheard various information. <br/>
I didn't know what the other heroes, Motoyasu, Ren, and Itsuki were doing before. <br/>
 <br/>
Motoyasu seems to be in south-western region, I heard he solved a famine for a village by providing some legendary crop. <br/>
That knowledge seems to have come from a game. <br/>
 <br/>
Ren is in the south-east region where atrocious devils are residing. It seems there's a rumour about him dealing with a violent dragon. <br/>
 <br/>
And Itsuki... Well, he seems to have brought down a tyrant in a small country to the north. <br/>
But there's no evidence of who Itsuki took down. There are also vague rumours that claim Itsuki of the Bow is the strongest hero. <br/>
 <br/>
Before I came to this strange world, I read about the 4 holy weapons and the events that are happening resembled what I read... <br/>
 <br/>
The journey continues with these thoughts. <br/>
Our levels after two weeks. <br/>
 <br/>
Me Lv 34 <br/>
Raphtalia Lv 37 <br/>
Firo Lv 32 <br/>
 <br/>
We have grown. <br/>
Firo's growth is abnormal because she is a demon... <br/>
Especially her physical abilities, before she needed both hands (Wings?) to pull the carriage, now she can do it with 1 while yawning. <br/>
(Tl note: 両手（翼？）<= that's in the actual chapter.) <br/>
The person in question says. <br/>
 <br/>
Firo: "This carriage is too light, my motivation is dropping." <br/>
 <br/>
Oh well. That's a good thing <br/>
It seems the Status Up bonuses from my shield is effective. <br/>
Though there are other changes. <br/>
 <br/>
Pickaxe Shield <br/>
Unsealing completed… Equipment Bonus: Mining Skill 1 <br/>
 <br/>
Crystal Ore Shield <br/>
Unsealing completed… Equipment Bonus: Craft Skill 1 <br/>
 <br/>
I wonder. When we arrived at a prosperous mining town, I found a broken pickaxe on the road and absorbed some crystal ore which was thrown away. <br/>
Although these two skill bonuses seem good for making money, I lack information. <br/>
If I fail in processing some ore, it would become trash, I think a recipe would be necessary. <br/>
In the first place, I had to solve the intermediate recipe book I got. <br/>
The deciphering was completed in 2 weeks. There were 3 weeks before that when I couldn't understand anything and had a staring contest with the book. <br/>
 <br/>
Antidote <br/>
Herbicide <br/>
Healing Ointment  <br/>
Treatment Medicine (Already able to make) <br/>
Nutritional Supplement (Already able to make) <br/>
Gunpowder <br/>
Strong acid <br/>
Magic Power water <br/>
Soul Healing Medicine  <br/>
Insecticide <br/>
 <br/>
That is what I have deciphered so far. The basic of the intermediate class is that the effects change depending on how it's mixed. <br/>
Although I can't be certain, understanding the recipe seems to provide a bonus. <br/>
I let my shield absorb some of the intermediate recipe book. <br/>
And the results were. <br/>
 <br/>
Book Shield <br/>
Unsealing completed……Equipment Bonus: Magical Power Up (Small) <br/>
 <br/>
Yup. I had high hopes that an intermediate recipe shield would appear. It seems to be a waste. <br/>
Besides, the defence is very low. <br/>
However, during the next morning, when I finished deciphering the Intermediate Recipe book. <br/>
 <br/>
Demon treants appeared, which were quickly dealt with and then absorbed. <br/>
 <br/>
Requirement for Trent Shield has been released. <br/>
Requirement for Blue Trent Shield has been released. <br/>
Requirement for Black Trent Shield has been released. <br/>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <br/>
Treant Shield <br/>
Unsealing completed……Equipment Bonus: Plate Appraisal 2 <br/>
 <br/>
Blue Treant Shield <br/>
Unsealing completed……Equipment Bonus: Intermediate Compound Recipe 1 <br/>
 <br/>
Black Treant Shield  <br/>
Unsealing completed……Equipment Bonus: Half Compounding  <br/>
 <br/>
Is this some kind of bullying? <br/>
Right after I finished deciphering that book too! <br/>
All I learned was the Heal Ointment? Perhaps, those monsters are materials for a recipe. <br/>
I cried when recipe 2 and 3 pops up. <br/>
I don't know how to make gunpowder, but it seems these treants are materials for herbicide and the healing ointment. <br/>
It seems that gunpowder can be substituted with some king flammable grass called Crackling grass. <br/>
I experiment with the gunpowder by collecting it into bags and creating make-shift bombs. <br/>
After setting the bags on fire, I hurl them at an enemy. <br/>
After throwing it, I dive to the side. Oh my, it seems the power of the bombs was terrible, it just burnt the bag and turned to ash. <br/>
It seems I'm not even allowed to attack with tools such as bombs. That's actually kind of amazing. <br/>
 <br/>
The strong acid that I store in a glass bottle seems to be a little less acidic than sulphuric acid. <br/>
This is not a medical herb, but it seems I can mix it with water. I don't know what I can do with this yet so I'll just let my shield absorb it. <br/>
 <br/>
The Magic Power water restores magical power when drunk. But, the materials are rare and hard to get. <br/>
It is an expensive medical herb. If I create this, I should sell it. <br/>
The Soul Healing Medicine seems to restore SP. It also seems to be rare and difficult to prepare. <br/>
 <br/>
Insecticide was easy. I just dissolve and mix grass that repels insects until it hardens. <br/>
Of the new recipes I learnt, the antidote, heal ointment and insecticide seems to be popular. <br/>
However, the herbicide seems to only sell in small quantities since people don't need that much. <br/>
I let my shield absorb the extras. <br/>
 <br/>
Requirement for Anti Poison Shield has been released. <br/>
Requirement for Glyphosate Shield has been released. (Tl note: http://i.imgur.com/t82ZsY2.jpg LOL) <br/>
Requirement for Medicine Shield has been released. <br/>
Requirement for Plant Fire Shield has been released. <br/>
Requirement for Killer Insect Shield α has been released. <br/>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <br/>
Anti Poison Shield <br/>
Unsealing completed… Equipment Bonus: Defence Power 5 <br/>
 <br/>
 <br/>
Glyphosate Shield <br/>
Unsealing completed… Equipment Bonus: 5% Damage Reduction from Plants <br/>
 <br/>
 <br/>
Medicine Shield <br/>
Unsealing completed… Equipment Bonus: Medicine Effect Range Expansion (small) <br/>
 <br/>
Plant Fire Shield <br/>
Unsealing completed… Equipment Bonus: Fire Resistance (Small) <br/>
 <br/>
 <br/>
Killer Insect Shield α <br/>
Unsealing completed… Equipment Bonus: 3% Damage Reduction from Insects <br/>
 <br/>
Perhaps I originally would have received the anti-poison shield, for Poison Resistance (Intermediate) but that probably changed because I acquired the Chimeric Viper Shield first. <br/>
The skills that I have acquired change due to the fact that I already have it, so instead of replacing the current skill, it gets replaced by something new. <br/>
I am also confused as to what the range expansion from the Medicine shield does. <br/>
Does it make it so that medicine is effective at a range or will be it effective to its surroundings? <br/>
 <br/>
I think the latter makes it way too convenient. <br/>
I wonder if the Plant Fire Shield is also effective against magic. <br/>
What Is Glyphosate? It's the chemical name for an herbicide. As for the Killer Insect Shield α... Maybe it will turn into Killer Insect Shield β if I increase the amount of herbs mixed. <br/>
The effect of reducing damage from specific enemies seems to be convenient. <br/>
 <br/>
The problem is deciphering the magic book. <br/>
It seems to be considerably difficult. <br/>
Raphtalia seems to have gotten the hang of it, but she can't use any magic effectively yet. <br/>
A ball of light floats in front of Raphtalia for a few seconds. <br/>
You're making this prestigious hero look bad. <br/>
Therefore, after Raphtalia goes to sleep, I asked Firo to use transformation magic. <br/>
Though it's difficult to call that magic, I am grasping at straws. <br/>
 <br/>
Firo: "Uhmm. Imagine what you want to become and feel the power gushing from the bottom of your body." <br/>
 <br/>
Yup. I completely don't understand. <br/>
I'm done thinking. <br/>
It seems that even after deciphering characters to read, I can't use magic. <br/>
I can't get the feeling of magic flowing since I am originally from a world without magic. <br/>
Still... I must learn magic. <br/>
I must live up to the expectations of that magic shop aunty. <br/>
 <br/>
Not participating in a wave would be a problem. Since no one else is protecting the villages and towns, it has become my job. <br/>
Sooner or later, being able to use magic might make a difference. <br/>
Though there is also the option of buying a crystal ball, a book is much cheaper. <br/>
Therefore, recently while riding the carriage, I've been groaning with a magic book in one hand. <br/>
It seems Raphtalia's explanation on magical power is the same as Firo's, it’s a feeling in your body that comes from the soul. <br/>
The feeling of sensing magical power that even Firo has, what kind of sense is that? <br/>
I continuously ponder that question in my head. <br/>
 <br/>
Oh well, such are the results of two weeks.
