Chapter 272: The Second Conference of Heroes [Start]<br/>
I step out of the Onsen and expose my body to the nighttime breeze. While I bask in the cool air, Ren and Motoyasu get out as well.<br/>
Itsuki and Rishia are already out, and they’re cooling off together.<br/>
I can see nothing but a couple when I look at them, but Itsuki’s expressionless face makes it feel like they had just experienced a failed date.<br/>
"Naofumi." (Ren)<br/>
Ren calls out to me.<br/>
I’m not sure what Raphtalia and the others are doing, but they haven’t exited the women’s side yet.<br/>
They’re taking a long bath.<br/>
"What?" (Naofumi)<br/>
"I asked this island’s count when I got here. He allowed us to use the conference room we used last time. Can we gather all the heroes there to talk?" (Ren)<br/>
"Isn’t the village fine?" (Naofumi)<br/>
"That’s true, but if you think about it, that’s the place where the heroes started arguing with and denying one another. That’s why I want us to gather there and talk once more." (Ren)<br/>
"How unnecessary." (Naofumi)<br/>
"I’ve already talked to Itsuki and Motoyasu. Let’s talk a bit before the women come out." (Ren)<br/>
"Waiting for them is a waste of time. I guess it’s fine." (Naofumi)<br/>
There’s nothing gained in waiting, so I’m fine with it.<br/>
It seems that Ren will be satisfied by it.<br/>
We climb the spiral stairs to the room we met in before.<br/>
Last time I climbed these steps, I was able to look out at the other islands.<br/>
When I try to look through the windows now, my vision is clouded by the darkness of night. I see nothing but shadows.<br/>
The island’s activation period is long over.<br/>
It’s like a resort’s off-season.<br/>
This island will only be lively again in 10 years.<br/>
I remember hearing it from the lord here.<br/>
Even during off-season, adventurers still come.<br/>
The area’s a tourist attraction, and the monsters have moderate strength, so hunting is permitted to a certain extent.<br/>
There are some rare monsters to be found. Are the materials rare as well?<br/>
I didn’t get too much money for them though.<br/>
Ren, Motoyasu and Midori, Itsuki and Rishia, and I enter the room and find seats around the round table.<br/>
"Henceforth, the second official conference of Heroes shall commence." (Ren)<br/>
Ren raises his hand and declares.<br/>
"There’s no chairman, I’d like to act as a representative." (Ren)<br/>
"Got it." (Naofumi)<br/>
Recently, Ren’s been overflowing with enthusiasm.<br/>
The goal of fighting the wave has ignited a flame within his soul.<br/>
My end goal is survival, so I doubt I’ll ever become like that.<br/>
The fact that he’s still obsessed with himself means that he hasn’t changed that much from the start.<br/>
Though, I think he’s on a better track than before.<br/>
"And? What did you want to talk about?" (Naofumi)<br/>
"Let’s continue the discussion that was suspended last time." (Ren)<br/>
"I think we were arguing about reinforcement methods." (Naofumi)<br/>
"Yeah…" (Ren)<br/>
Ren raises his sword out front and starts reading something I cannot see.<br/>
"Naofumi gave Shadow… a list of our various methods of getting stronger. We can combine them to obtain greater strength. At first, I didn’t believe it… but Naofumi was able to integrate all of them to put a stop to the calamity we caused. This points to the fact that his words were the truth." (Ren)<br/>
"That’s right." (Motoyasu)<br/>
Motoyasu and Ren both nod.<br/>
Itsuki just gives off the feeling of nodding.<br/>
"Because of my curse, I was unable to carry out smithing or enhancements well, but thanks to the daily usage of the onsens, I’m gradually getting better." (Ren)<br/>
"There’s no way Father-in-Law would ever lie. I learned to put these methods to practice myself!" (Motoyasu)<br/>
Motoyasu announces this fact with a smile on his face.<br/>
"I know, so calm down. Itsuki, what about you?" (Naofumi)<br/>
"… I understand." (Itsuki)<br/>
Itsuki fiddles with the icons on his status. His eyes dart back and forth.<br/>
"I did it." (Itsuki)<br/>
It’s because he can’t think for himself right now.<br/>
The current Itsuki doesn’t know how to doubt others.<br/>
I guess this makes his situation worthwhile.<br/>
"… So it was true. If I wasn’t so prideful at that time, then perhaps all of that wouldn’t have happened." (Itsuki)<br/>
Since his symptoms are slowly being alleviated, Itsuki is able to utter some words of regret.<br/>
Is this because of the curse? Or are those his true thoughts? Who can say.<br/>
"That’s why, once more, I wish to continue this talk." (Ren)<br/>
"Are you sure there’s more to talk about?" (Naofumi)<br/>
"No, there has to be something else." (Ren)<br/>
"What is there left to say?" (Naofumi)<br/>
I think I know everything I need to know from the other three heroes.<br/>
"Naofumi, recently, I’ve been travelling with Eclaire, Rishia, and the others from your village. During that time, I discovered something that I want to show you." (Ren)<br/>
"What?" (Naofumi)<br/>
"This." (Ren)<br/>
Ren changes the shape of his sword and presents it to me.<br/>
It’s a strangely shaped sword which looks like a bundle of strings strung around each other countless times.<br/>
Honestly, it doesn’t look strong at all.<br/>
"What is that?" (Naofumi)<br/>
"It’s a blade called the Comrade Sword. It’s ability is"Comrade Growth Adjustment (Small)"" (Ren)<br/>
"What are the conditions to unlock it?" (Naofumi) (TL: Literally, the Nakama Sword)<br/>
"… I don’t know. Before I knew it, it was unlocked." (Ren)<br/>
"Fumu…" (Naofumi)<br/>
Comrade Growth Adjustment (Small)… is it? It’s the same as my slave enhancement.<br/>
Looking at the current Ren, I have no idea how he got it.<br/>
"If this were a game, would the unlock condition be something like trusting your companions from the bottom of your heart?" (Naofumi)<br/>
I start off with a vague enquiry, and Ren nods.<br/>
"Probably…" (Ren)<br/>
With a bitter expression, he continues.<br/>
"As I thought. I didn’t fully trust my previous comrades. If only this sword came out earlier, then perhaps they wouldn’t have died." (Ren)<br/>
"That’s one possibility. But that doesn’t make it useless now." (Naofumi)<br/>
"… As expected of Naofumi. That’s why, like this, I want to discuss any new things we may have discovered." (Ren)<br/>
"I see. I understand where you’re coming from." (Naofumi)<br/>
I think there are plenty of things I haven’t discovered yet, so asking around may be useful.<br/>
There may be materials I have yet to feed my shield with highly desirable abilities.<br/>
Comrade Sword… It seems to have an ability like my Slave Use Shield.<br/>
… Wait a second. Do the effects stack?<br/>
I mean, Ren’s trusted comrades are Female Knight and Taniko, right?<br/>
Female Knight’s another case, but Taniko’s my slave.<br/>
If his comrade growth correction stacks with my slave one, then it would be really useful.<br/>
I’ll need to carefully look over Taniko’s status later.<br/>
By the way, I’m also doing a bit of research on my own.<br/>
"Then, should I teach you something?" (Naofumi)<br/>
"What is it?" (Ren)<br/>
"Yeah, when I fed my slave’s hair and such to the Shield, more Shields with growth corrections came out. In Ren’s case, I recommend feeding Kiel or Taniko’s weapon to your sword." (Naofumi)<br/>
What I found were racial Shield systems.<br/>
But, there are plenty of skill-trees I’m unable to unlock as of yet.<br/>
Atlas, Fohl, and Sadina’s races are currently impossible.<br/>
What I unlocked were race Growth Corrections.<br/>
"Recommend… Naofumi even knows that much." (Ren)<br/>
"But it’s not like I’ve tried feeding meat and bone." (Naofumi)<br/>
As if I could do something that insane.<br/>
The Heroes must remain as humans.<br/>
"Right. Ren, try Female Knight’s hair too. Perhaps you’ll get a Comrade Sword II." (Naofumi)<br/>
"Eclaire is a bit…" (Ren)<br/>
She looks like one who would complain a bit.<br/>
That girl seems like the type who would say, ‘A girl’s hair is her life’ or something.<br/>
(TL: A Japanese saying)<br/>
"Father-in-Law, I’ve also tried absorbing everyone’s feathers into my spear." (Motoyasu)<br/>
"I’ve already unlocked all of the Filo Rial series." (Naofumi)<br/>
"As expected of Father-in-Law! How did you get them all!? Please tell me!" (Motoyasu)<br/>
"Motoyasu, you’re being loud. Think about it by yourself." (Naofumi)<br/>
My base stats have risen a considerable amount.<br/>
Now that I think about it… Sadina said that Raphtalia was not of the Raccoon tribe.<br/>
Though she’s of some relation to them.<br/>
There was a Raccoon Shield on my shield tree, but it never unlocked.<br/>
I’ve always wondered why, but it must be because Raphtalia is a subspecies.<br/>
I guess I’m satisfied with that explanation.<br/>
By the way, Sadina’s didn’t unlock either.<br/>
I fed her materials to the Shield too, but the Luka Shield didn’t unlock.<br/>
She said she was of the Sakamata Race, I think.<br/>
Taniko was of the Nui Race, and when I inserted Kiel’s fur into the shield, the Wanui Shield was unlocked.<br/>
(TL: Nui is an anagram of Inu, which is dog. If I scramble Dog, they become too OP.)<br/>
(ED: God Kiel lol)<br/>
From a glance, they both have dog ears and tails, but it seems they’re a little different.<br/>
I mean, Kiel can transform.<br/>
Anyways, with all the subspecies and relatives, even if I know the basic traits, I can’t tell apart the specific species.<br/>
Raphtalia’s race is pretty much like the difference between a Balloon and an Orange Balloon.<br/>
If I took some Raccoon hair, would I understand something?<br/>
No, it didn’t help at all.<br/>
An icon did light up, but it didn’t unlock.<br/>
I should have been able to see the name of her racial shield, but I couldn’t figure it out.<br/>
Though several shields lit up, even if I knew the race, I could’t change to it.<br/>
The Shields linked to Raccoon are ones like High Raccoon and East Raccoon. There are quite a few.<br/>
Perhaps it would be good to look at the Filo Rial tree for reference.<br/>
After I received Fitoria’s feather, though it unlocked the series, after a certain point, the names showed up as ???.<br/>
It’s like that.<br/>
The Filo Rial series has had all the material requirements met, so as long as I raise my level, I should become able to use them. Even now, there are a few locked ones.<br/>
In Raphtalia’s case, the materials are insufficient.<br/>
Is hair not enough?<br/>
But it’s not like she’s a monster, so I can’t get any meat or bone.<br/>
… But if you think about it, could I use humans as materials too?<br/>
What exactly are these legendary weapons?<br/>
"Father-in-Law?" (Motoyasu)<br/>
"… What?" (Naofumi)<br/>
Is he going to talk about Filo Rials again?<br/>
"How about feeding death row prisoners to your weapon?" (Motoyasu)<br/>
"………………………………………… Ren, how about it?" (Naofumi)<br/>
"Nonono! I get the feeling that’s a line that should never be crossed…" (Ren)<br/>
"That’s right, let’s give up." (Naofumi)<br/>
Motoyasu. You’re getting quite dangerous.<br/>
I think it’s best to carefully distance myself from him.<br/>
I forcibly change the topic.<br/>
"Ah, right. The Hero Inscription on this island, did you people read it?" (Naofumi)<br/>
Itsuki is still learning. His magic doesn’t recover, so he can’t read magic words.<br/>
Even so, he’s learning the written language.<br/>
That’s why I address this question to Ren and Motoyasu.<br/>
"Yeah, I read it." (Ren)<br/>
"Of course, Father-in-Law!" (Motoyasu)<br/>
"What magic did you get?" (Naofumi)<br/>
There’s a possibility that the magic learned depends on the individual.<br/>
I learned Zveit Aura, but it’s not certain that Ren and Motoyasu learned the same.<br/>
"Zveit Magic Enchant."<br/>
