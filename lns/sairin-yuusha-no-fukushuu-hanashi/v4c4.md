「Huh――、hah hah」<br/>
The ground is trampled and the trees were avoided as Elfi keep descend the holy mountain with the “Demon Legs”.<br/>
In the posthaste changing scenery, I am in wary of the pursuers that might be chasing us from behind, but there is no sign that the selectors are coming after us.<br/>
Perhaps they are being wary the fact that I able to overcome those falling star, or maybe they have changed their tactic to wait-and-see before making any moves.<br/>

Report this adAfter a few minutes, we finally reached the foot of the holy mountain without any incident.<br/>
「Haa……Haa……」(Elfi)<br/>
「……Are you okay?」(Iori)<br/>
Elfi seemed to breathe heavily due to having consumed a considerable amount of her physical strength and magical power.<br/>
She is sweating like a waterfall.<br/>
Hence, I take out the cloth from the pouch and *GoshiGoshi* wipe off the sweat.<br/>
「Haa……It was three-time harder than what I thought」(Elfi)<br/>
「……we were saved, thanks, Elfi」(Iori)<br/>
There is no intention of having disdained, but that attack was really something unexpected. If it just a star alone, Elfi and I could handle it somehow. However, it would be impossible to handle the second one if there’s no mental magic.<br/>
From nine out of ten, I almost certainly it is an attack by Lusers and there was a possibility that there was a skilled person of Luser class among the selectors, but I never heard of it when I collecting information at the Kingdom castle.<br/>

「Fuu……」(Elfi)<br/>
After a while, Elfi breathing started to calm down and I begin a talk about Luser after giving her a water.<br/>
「Given the” Obstruction Barrier “and the Lost Magic, they should have prepared themselves. They probably have worn out themselves with this ambushed too」(Iori)<br/>
After failing with that falling star, they probably start moving on to the next step soon.<br/>
「……If so, there are going to be next surprise too?」(Elfi)<br/>
「Even if there was a surprise attack soon, there is a high chance that the magic of such that falling star class cannot be used in succession……Anyway, we can’t afford to let our guard down」(Iori)<br/>
I look up at the holy mountain while gritting my teeth. Even though Luser is nearby, I unable kill him right now.<br/>
There is nothing more frustrating than this.<br/>

Even in the present state, I can kill him if I use the mental magic, but I want to put more attention to absorb the next labyrinth core.<br/>
It would be nice if he shows himself up, but long as he takes some distance like a while ago, I will only be aimed one-sidedly.<br/>
「I’m sorry, but please do not forget to be wary of our surroundings for a while. Even though I’m gonna take some measures against it, but Elfi demon eyes are more efficient」(Iori)<br/>
「Umu, just leave it to me. Because I’m gonna make Iori feel save like riding a dragon and Iori just need to focus on the revenge method」(Elfi)<br/>

「Don’t push yourself too much, okay?」(Iori)<br/>
「If you say that then I will accept those words gratefully. Then, Iori should give me a piggyback ride to the Holy City」(Elfi)<br/>
Elfi does not forget that to stick out her chest haughtily while her knees are *GakuGaku* trembling when she said it.<br/>
I wonder why.<br/>
Rather than when she doing such “kinglike” thing purposely like this, she more looks like a proper demon king when she fighting.<br/>

I went through the highway from the foot of the sacred mountain for around half a day. By the time the sun was leaning, we arrived at the Holy City of Schmelz.<br/>
On the way, I did not neglect my vigilance, however, there was no surprise attack by Luser.<br/>
There was also no sign of being watched, too.<br/>
Because the surrounding is open, it seems that the other party is wary and taking some distance from us.<br/>

Elfi’s magic item was excellent as her disguise didn’t blow before the gate soldier.<br/>

「……this was the first time I saw this city, but it really a beautiful city」(Elfi)<br/>
「Aa, I was surprised when I came here for the first time too」(Iori)<br/>
The cityscape of Religious State consists of white basically.<br/>
The colour that “Holy Light God” Melt wore in the body seems to be white and I wonder if they choose it by considering that.<br/>
Therefore, I can feel a sense of unification that cannot be felt in other countries.<br/>
Together with Elfi who admires the scene, we advance through the city.<br/>
This city separates into several districts.<br/>
Right now we at a districts called『Commercial District』 As the name suggests, there are lodgings and restaurant in the『Commercial District』 The majority of people coming from outside are heading for the『Commercial District』first.<br/>

There are a few other compartments, but it doesn’t matter to us.<br/>
While we are here, we do not have to worry too much about the surprise attack.<br/>
Because, if Holy City is exposed to harm, the Knight’s Templar won’t remain silent about it.<br/>
Even Luser will avoid from causing any trouble with them. Because they probably want to hide the affair regarding the summoning of hero itself.<br/>
「Let’s head to the Inn for the meantime. I will be collecting the information tomorrow」(Iori)<br/>

It due to the factions that were known as the demi-humans companionship faction was established.<br/>

There are three things to do.<br/>
Firstly, I have to ask the blacksmith to use the demon crystal of the “Overlord Squid” that I obtained in the Labyrinth of Death Swamp.<br/>
Secondly, gathering the information regarding the revenge target.<br/>
Thirdly, gathering the information regarding the Religious State Five Demon Lord Labyrinth the “Labyrinth of Mourning Light”<br/>
Even though I can use the mental magic, it is only a matter of a few seconds and the specific invocation conditions are unclear.<br/>
My fighting ability is still far from perfect. However, there is nothing helpful than to secure the much better equipment after all.<br/>

 <br/>
Next, I walk towards the northern part of the『Commercial District』<br/>
There is the『Holy Light District』on the way to the north, where the church library is located and it close by to the『Commercial District』<br/>
It is about thirty minutes on foot from the arms shop.<br/>
It is time when I walked while avoiding the crowd.<br/>
「……!?」(Iori)<br/>
「Kyaa!?」<br/>
As I bumped into a girl who sprung out from the corner of the road. The girl screams and falls on her backside on the ground.<br/>
Instinctively, I stretch out my hand to the jade longsword in respond whether it was a surprise attack from Luser.<br/>
「Ouch……!」<br/>
However, there’s a tear in the eyes of the girl who had fallen on her backside on the ground, and there is no sign that she has some weapon.<br/>
There is a sign that Elfi is using the demon eye in the back, and it does not seem to be any assailant when I look around.<br/>
「……Are you okay?」(Iori)<br/>
I call out the girl while remaining vigilant.<br/>
「Mou, where were you looking at when you are walking……!」<br/>
The girl raises up while complaining.<br/>
But you’re the one who bumps into me in the first place though.<br/>
I stole a glance at the angry girl with tearful eyes.<br/>
She was a girl with a showy pink hair colour.<br/>
Who wears a black tube top that paired with the grey skirt with knee sock that covering her thighs with long boots up to the knees.<br/>
While a tear was floating in her blackish pink eyes, she glaring at me with upturned eyes.<br/>
「Are you hurt?」(Iori)<br/>
「Look here! What were you going to do, if my beautiful body got hurt! Good grief!」<br/>
With such kind of attitude, I’m sure that she got no injuries.<br/>
「Let’s go, Elfi」(Iori)<br/>
「Mu……Are you sure that it okay?」(Elfi)<br/>
「Aa」(Iori)<br/>
Our time is limited.<br/>
Only one of today’s plans has been accomplished and I have to start gathering information as soon as possible too.<br/>
「It’s not okay!!」<br/>
But the girl blocked me who was going to go ahead.<br/>
「……Is there still something else?」(Iori)<br/>
「There is! There is a lot of it! I mean! To just leaving this pretty girl after knocking her down, aren’t you a bit too cold !?」<br/>
This fellow looks a bit like Elfi.<br/>
Especially that self-praising parts when she self-proclaimed that she a beauty or she a cutie.<br/>
「……Wh-what wrong with this woman. She seems a bit of an oddball, Iori」(Elfi)<br/>
「Look at yourself first」(Iori)<br/>
「Umm……I didn’t get it, but」<br/>
“Anyways!” as that girl thrusting her finger at me.<br/>
「Because you have injured the body of a pretty girl, there should are a bit more than just simply asking such question, right! Otherwise, you will be punished!」<br/>
「Is that so? Then, I’m sorry and I’ll pay attention next time. So, are this good enough?」(Iori)<br/>
「Fufun, It’s good that you understand」<br/>
……This fellow really looks like Elfi.<br/>
「Well then, we’re going now」(Iori)<br/>
「Yup, well then bye-bye……Eh! hold on a minute!」<br/>
What an awfully persistent woman.<br/>
Is this some kind of plot?<br/>
There seems to be no hostility, if she one of Luser group member, there is a possibility that she is someone who tries to hold us down at this place. But there is no presence, or did he intend to attack by sniping?<br/>
Maybe we should take her to the back alley and interrogate her.<br/>
I look back at the girl while thinking so.<br/>
「――――」<br/>
The pink eyes were looking into me.<br/>
I do feel a feeling of coercion that Elfi gives off albeit I do not feel any hostility or malice from it.<br/>
It just a feeling that having my heart is being peeped through. Unconsciously my hand extends to the jade longsword.<br/>
「……What?」(Iori)<br/>
「No, it’s nothing. I’m just going to give you some advice」<br/>
「……Advice?」(Iori)<br/>
「It might be better to leave this place as soon as possible」<br/>
「Why?」(Iori)<br/>
「I had a bad hunch and because I stayed in this town for too long. Well, there are other reasons too」<br/>

「That’s because」<br/>
As she stops with a short pause.<br/>
「――It because I attracted the disaster」<br/>

「――――」(Iori)<br/>
To the solidifying me, the girl put out her tongue.<br/>
By closing one eye and laughing with a look like a mischievous child.<br/>
「Then, see you later!」<br/>
Waving here hand here, she runs off in the same way how we met.<br/>
「……see you later?」(Iori)<br/>
What was that?<br/>
「Elfi. Just to make sure, did you sense anything?」(Iori)<br/>
「……Umu. She doesn’t have that much magical power nor she has any special magic items with her. She just a strange woman」(Elfi)<br/>
「Is that so?」(Iori)<br/>
I sense nothing in particular, too. But I’m quite bothered by her ambiguous words.<br/>

Then, the surroundings abruptly got dark.<br/>
For a moment I thought that the sun was hiding in the clouds, but I immediately deny that idea.<br/>
「……A shadow?」(Iori)<br/>
Something big is flying in the sky.<br/>
「What is……」<br/>
「……That is」<br/>
The “Pterosaur ” flew when I looked up at the sky.<br/>
Beyond the Holy Gate, there are several pterosaurs are flying over the Holy City.<br/>
「……It’s absurd because there should be no dragon species inhabit around here」(Iori)<br/>
The pterosaur is a small dragon species.<br/>
It is known as troublesome demonic beings that fell short of the likes of Flames Dragons and Cave Dragons.<br/>
『――GIAAAAAAA!!』<br/>
The pterosaur is roaring high-pitched in the sky.<br/>
「Wha, a dragon? It is a dragon!」<br/>
「What!? Why is there a pterosaur here!?」<br/>
The surrounding people noticed the pterosaurs with a delay.<br/>
There’s those who look up at the sky is petrify, and those who simply scream out, and those who run away rushingly.<br/>
一 The town has fallen into a panic in an instant.<br/>
「Is this that girl doing……?」(Iori)<br/>
That girl said that it would be better to leave here.<br/>
Was it because she has foreseen this raid?<br/>
If she was an official of the Demon king army, it is not something strange for her to knows beforehand.<br/>
I look at the way where that the girls left and of course that pink hair was not found anymore.<br/>
As expected, I should have seized her back then?<br/>
「……It’s coming!」(Elfi)<br/>
Elfi’s shouts have cut through my thoughts.<br/>
The wyvern which was in the sky went down all at once towards the ground.<br/>
While giving an earsplitting roar, they bare their fang at the escaping humans.<br/>
「……Tsk」(Iori)<br/>
I pulled out the jade longsword and thrust myself in between the dragon and the man.<br/>
I stop the charge of the Pterosaur with the “Magic Break Suppression”.<br/>
Because a certain amount of my magical power has returns, the reinforced shield had completely prevented the attack of the Pterosaur.<br/>
「Oi, escape quickly!」(Iori)<br/>
「Y-yes……!」<br/>
The Pterosaur raise and comes swinging down its enormous claw. Then, I receive it with “soft sword” as I confirm the obstacle are already gone.<br/>
Hence, I divert the impact to the ground and swiftly swing the jade longsword.<br/>
『Giiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiii!?』<br/>
As the pterosaur letting out a scream as the blade has gouged one of its eyes.<br/>
「――Move to sideways!」(Elfi)<br/>
Then, Elfi struck it with her demon eyes.<br/>
The unable to dodge pterosaur which agony with a pain is scattering about.<br/>
『GAaaaAAAAAAAA!!』<br/>
『Giiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiii!!』<br/>
Looking at the death of its kind, the attention of other Pterosaur has turned to this place.<br/>
They come all at once while roaring.<br/>
「Elfi, you stop the movement with the demon eyes<br/>
while I will round them up」(Iori)<br/>
「Got it」(Elfi)<br/>
It was when Elfi tried to invoke the “Heavy Collapse”.<br/>
「――I’ll have you atone for the sin of defiling the holy city」<br/>
Along with the voice, a swift slash struck the pterosaur.<br/>
 <br/>
◆<br/>
 <br/>
It was the man who wore the blue-silver armour who use that slash.<br/>
The pterosaur falls to the ground after one of its wing being cut off.<br/>
Then, there countless of magic falling like rain from behind the armoured man.<br/>
「That armour, is it the “Knight Templar”?」(Elfi)<br/>
The highest war potential that Religious state proud of.<br/>
It is a skilled knight who eliminates the person that pose harm to God and the heresies.<br/>
The armour of the blue silver colour which represents the knight templar and they were also feared by the Mazoku.<br/>
If you noticed, those who were wearing pure blueish silver armour were fighting everywhere. Some shoot down the pterosaur with magic while others deliver a slash into it.<br/>
While each of them shows high proficiency and slaughter the pterosaur with cooperative movements.<br/>
At the centre of it was the man who delivered the first slash.<br/>
He is fighting and leads the knights while giving accurate instructions to various places.<br/>
The knights may be stronger than the A rank adventurers that we saw in the labyrinth city.<br/>
It is a fair degree of discipline.<br/>
「There seems to be no room for us」(Elfi)<br/>
「Aa」(Iori)<br/>
Then in a blink of an eye, the pterosaur was annihilated.<br/>
 <br/>
◆<br/>
「I’m the knight of the chivalric of the templar, second corps’ vice commander……Leo William Displender. I appreciate having cooperated in the annihilation of the pterosaur」<br/>
After all the pterosaur were annihilated, the man with the Indigo hair came here to say his thanks.<br/>
He is a tall man with a short-cut in his mid-twenties.<br/>
The armour of the blueish silver wore on his body is engraved with the emblem different from the other knights. As for William between his names, probably it will be a baptismal name.<br/>
「Hmph」<br/>
After having thanked us, Leo snorts his nose.<br/>
「But……this is a sacred holy city. It is not preferable for other than of our chivalric order of templar to wield a sword. Are you guys an outsider? You don’t have to fight next time, and just leave it to us the chivalric order of templar」<br/>
「……You bastard, we just」(Elfi)<br/>
「That’s all, because it’s safe now, so please do as you like」<br/>
Leo left for his group after he keeps talking one-sidedly to us.<br/>
We never have a chance to say a thing at all.<br/>
「What the hell was that? That guy is rude!」(Elfi)<br/>
「……I get the reason for you to get pissed off, but we shouldn’t fight with him. Because there is no reason for us to get involved with the Knights templar」(Iori)<br/>
And if Elfi being exposed that she a Mazoku, it is us the ones who being pointed by their sword. Because they are people who would rush at us without forethought if the other party is a Mazoku’s.<br/>
However, I don’t think that we will lose, but it’s just something unnecessary.<br/>
It is better to not get involved with them.<br/>
一With some exceptions, though.<br/>
「Nevertheless, there’s a lot hindrance happen today」(Iori)<br/>
That girl of those pterosaurs, perhaps it’s my unlucky day, huh.<br/>
I blow out a sigh and turn my gaze toward the knight templar.<br/>
Some time ago Leo and another man were instructions to the knights.<br/>
Since Leo introduced himself as a vice-captain, is another one a captain?<br/>
「……?」(Iori)<br/>
When I turned my eyes at the seems to be captain, I had a sense of deja vu.<br/>
Have I seen that guy somewhere before……?<br/>
He is a man in his prime age around fifties.<br/>
The short-aligned yellow-green hair and those sullen blue eyes. With big well trained muscular build.<br/>
The more I look at him, the more sense of deja vu I felt.<br/>
Besides, I know this sense of deja vu.<br/>
I have experienced it before, too.<br/>
Like when I saw the aged Luser as soon as I was re-summoned――――<br/>
 <br/>
「……That’s it」(Iori)<br/>
「…….?」(Elfi)<br/>
He was the man who was in charge of transporting supplies for the Knights Templar three decades ago.<br/>
If I’m not wrong, his name was Marx Pietro Sandalphon.<br/>
He did not appear in Luser memory, but it is the name that came out when I torturing Dionis.<br/>
He was the transporter man who has been bribed by Dionis and he was the one who supposed to passed the『Amulet of Substitution』to me.<br/>
「……I said that it would be better not to get involved with the Knights Templar, but it seems likely not to be so」(Iori)<br/>
「……?」(Elfi)<br/>
「And, there is another thing to investigate」(Iori)<br/>
There’s another one that attracts my intention, he probably Marx younger brother or even his kin.<br/>
That will be obvious as soon as I investigate it.<br/>
Luser who is leading the selectors.<br/>
The old couple that own orphanages that living nearby the holy city.<br/>
And a man who belongs to the Knight Templar.<br/>
「Well, it’s a good thing to me for having them gathering here」(Iori)<br/>
As my smile brimming over unintentionally.<br/>
Apparently, it seems that I will be able to fulfil my revenge in on go in the Religious state.<br/>
