17-52. Guardians of the World (2)<br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
Satou here. You could find lots of boss characters that break the game balance during the dawn of computer games.<br/>
When I first entered the industry, my seniors told me that it was a tactic to prevent those games from getting sold to second-hand stores, but I still believe they're not being serious even now. I think it's simply because they couldn't make final adjustments to those bosses before they hit the deadline.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
◇<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
『--Incoming Black Octopus class!』<br/>
<br/>
That thing is pretty resistant to magic, they're a pain to deal with.<br/>
<br/>
『Arisa, this is my turn so I announce.』<br/>
『OK, we'll leave defending to you, Nana.』<br/>
『Yes Arisa.』<br/>
<br/>
Multiple layers of the latest type of Castle get deployed, protecting our spaceship.<br/>
<br/>
『Transformation! Trinity Staff Mode!!』<br/>
<br/>
There's no such mode, but I made it so our spaceship transform just as Arisa imagined in her head.<br/>
I simply need to copy wand ship's function which should be limited to one originally and make it three instead.<br/>
<br/>
『You're in charge of aiming, Lulu!』<br/>
『Un, I got it. Firearms Control Anti-god Mode.』<br/>
『Aye aye Ma'am, Fire Control Setting, Anti Immortal Mode.』<br/>
<br/>
The ship's bow that has been split into three are getting wrapped in rainbow colored lights.<br/>
<br/>
『Mythology Down.』<br/>
『Mythology Extinction.』<br/>
『Mythology Gluttony.』<br/>
<br/>
Three anti-god magic shot with the spaceship's assistance swallows up the black octopus.<br/>
Mia's [Mythology Gluttony] is a minor change version customized from [Mythology Eater] for space use.<br/>
Its direct damage is no different from Mythology Eater but it falls short on continuous damage.<br/>
Though unlike on ground, keeping up on continuous damage is hard in space due to its vastness, thus Mythology Gluttony is simply the superior choice for space use.<br/>
<br/>
『--No way.』<br/>
『It survived getting hit by three anti-god magic amplified by the space ship?』<br/>
<br/>
A black globe came out of the explosion.<br/>
<br/>
『Don't worry. We did damage it. It's not unscathed. It's true you know? Its core has been exposed, now's our chance to finish it off. So please, take care of the rest--』<br/>
<br/>
Mia's right, the black octopus has been severely injured.<br/>
<br/>
『Acknowledged.』<br/>
『--First Blade, Unlimited Propagation--Mythology Fang~?』<br/>
<br/>
Countless clones of Tama spun around with huge fangs growing all over those clones body, turning the mountain range-sized creature into a mincemeat as it was attempting to regenerate the body portion that protects its core.<br/>
First time I've seen this technique, but it appears to be a developed form of her special technique [Vanquish Fang].<br/>
She must have worked really hard trying to recreate Arisa and the girls' anti-god magic.<br/>
<br/>
『Second Blade, Lyuryu and Pochi's Friendship Unite Strike--Dragon Drill Stratos, nanodesu!』<br/>
<br/>
Lyuryu and Pochi who's united as one single dragon dog zoomed out at near lightspeed toward the core that Tama exposed.<br/>
Transparent blue and jet black sparks scattered everywhere.<br/>
<br/>
『Gunyunyunyunyu--』<br/>
--ＬＹＵＲＹＵＲＹＵ.<br/>
<br/>
The emergency rocket booster on Pochi's and Lyuryu's exosuit spewed flames out.<br/>
However, even that wasn't enough to break apart the too enormous core.<br/>
<br/>
『--Guts, nanodesu!』<br/>
--ＬＹＵ!<br/>
<br/>
Magic Edge Cannons shot out of Pochi's and Lyuryu's tails one after another.<br/>
The outer shell protecting the core vibrated intensely.<br/>
<br/>
『WOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO nanodesu!』<br/>
--ＬＹＵＲＹＵＲＹＵ.<br/>
<br/>
The outer shell finally yielded to Pochi's and Lyuryu's guts, a crack was formed on it.<br/>
Right as the two exhausted their power, the core's outer shell broke into pieces like an obsidian.<br/>
<br/>
『Very well done desuwa!』<br/>
『Liza-san! We have retrieved Pochi-chan and Lyuryu!』<br/>
『Affirmative--』<br/>
<br/>
The fighter craft Zena-san and lady Karina piloted towed Pochi and Lyuryu away from the outer shell.<br/>
<br/>
『<<Dragonic Penetrator Infinity>>』<br/>
<br/>
There, at laser-like speed, Liza along with a lone white light pierced through like a single arrow.<br/>
Black Octopus's core that had lost its protection had no way to bear this attack, its life force lost its shine as it stopped moving.<br/>
<br/>
"Ooh, amazing."<br/>
<br/>
I didn't think the girls would be able to defeat that annoying Black Octopus.<br/>
Watching their unexpected growth, I'm feeling so proud of them from the bottom of my heart.<br/>
Let's give them the highest possible praise once this is all over.<br/>
<br/>
『Get away, Liza-san!』<br/>
『More Black Octopuses. --Ten of them?!』<br/>
<br/>
Okay, now that's way out of their league.<br/>
<br/>
I get in there with Unit Arrangement to shield Liza and the others.<br/>
<br/>
The sight of satellite-sized Black Octopuses charging straight at me looks quite impactful.<br/>
I invoked [Planet Guard] behind me to protect the girls from a spell I was going to activate next.<br/>
<br/>
--Space magic 『Summon Sun (Call Flare)』.<br/>
<br/>
By connecting space to the surface of the sun, I called forth the flares erupting out of it to roast the Black Octopuses.<br/>
The space magic used to call the flares may not work, but being a natural phenomena, solar flares cannot be erased by the Black Octopuses' magic annulment.<br/>
Black Octopus burned by the Flames of Origin (Flare) stopped moving before entering self-regeneration mode.<br/>
<br/>
One shot of Flare isn't enough to kill them huh.<br/>
<br/>
"These guys are pointlessly tough."<br/>
<br/>
Dragon God caught up to Black Octopuses, then she bit them down with her enormous jaws, and tore them apart with her fangs and claws.<br/>
<br/>
As expected of the strongest god.<br/>
Even though they've stopped moving from my Flare, I can't believe she just went and massacred those tenacious octopuses so easily.<br/>
<br/>
--Crisis Perception.<br/>
<br/>
"Kagura!"<br/>
<br/>
The moment I shouted, the Black Octopuses clung to Dragon God at near light speed one after another, covering her rainbow light in jet black color.<br/>
<br/>
『Dragon God-sama!』<br/>
『This looks bad, doesn't it?』<br/>
"I think she's going to be okay--"<br/>
<br/>
--I won't just stand by and watch.<br/>
<br/>
I teleported next to Kagura with Unit Arrangement and took out the Moon Drawn Sword.<br/>
<br/>
And now to match my body size to it--done.<br/>
<br/>
『Master turned gigantic nodesu!』<br/>
『Ouh, greato~?』<br/>
<br/>
I slash at the Black Octopuses with the Moon Drawn Sword now that I'm sized up just right to wield it.<br/>
<br/>
"This thing isn't too sharp."<br/>
<br/>
Using Unit Creation, I synthesize the broken Holy Magic Divine Sword Pendragon lying in my Storage with the Moon Drawn Sword.<br/>
<br/>
Unit Creation is way too convenient.<br/>
<br/>
With the newly formed rainbow-colored Moon Drawn Sword in hand, I sliced and diced all the Black Octopuses and freed Kagura.<br/>
<br/>
"Yup, nice going."<br/>
"Nothing less to expect from Ichirou. I shan't lose myself."<br/>
<br/>
I had a competition with Kagura to see which would kill more.<br/>
<br/>
『Don't tell me, he's as strong as Dragon God-sama?』<br/>
『World Crisis...』<br/>
<br/>
I felt like I could hear the girls saying something, but I ignored it.<br/>
<br/>
『...This much gap.』<br/>
<br/>
Even god Tenion sounded astounded.<br/>
<br/>
As I gleefully hunted down the black octopuses together with Dragon God, I suddenly felt a presence of noise from the side.<br/>
Turning my line of sight there, I noticed the dragons who were having fun battling the Bizarre Creatures moving oddly. <br/>
<br/>
『Nyu!』<br/>
"Finally showed itself up huh."<br/>
<br/>
A golden shining light emerged out of black clouds formed by the Bizarre Creatures.<br/>
Its size is such that the black octopuses around it look fist-sized. The thing is as big as a planet.<br/>
<br/>
The creature shining golden spots a bizarre chaotic form, like a cross between plant, fish and bird.<br/>
<br/>
According to AR reading, it's named Gold Bird Tree Fish (Chaos).<br/>
<br/>
"What an ugly fake."<br/>
<br/>
For now--.<br/>
<br/>
--Space Magic Call Flare.<br/>
<br/>
After burning it with flames of origin, I let out a volley of [Mythology Down].<br/>
<br/>
『--No way, it's not working at all?』<br/>
<br/>
"Well I mean, you often see last bosses that won't go down with that much attack--"<br/>
<br/>
I turned around to look at Kagura.<br/>
<br/>
"Will fangs work?"<br/>
"But of course. My fangs 『Pierce All』."<br/>
<br/>
Right they were.<br/>
<br/>
Then we should manage somehow.<br/>
<br/>
I took up a newly copied rainbow Moon Drawn Sword in my other hand, sized up to match Chaos and kept slicing and dicing it using both swords.<br/>
Kagura beat up Chaos with Dragon God's fangs and tail.<br/>
<br/>
"This thing is so obstinate."<br/>
"See? I told you it's a pain."<br/>
<br/>
The part I cut and stab keeps regenerating, damage just won't accumulate.<br/>
<br/>
『Master, please let us help you.』<br/>
『Pochi and gang will help nodesu!』<br/>
『Tama will do her best~?』<br/>
『Ichirou-nii! Remember, strength in numbers!』<br/>
『Kuh, she said it ahead of me!』<br/>
<br/>
Beastkin girls riding on Black Dragon Heiron came to help.<br/>
Followed by the spaceship guarded by heavenly dragons.<br/>
<br/>
"Let them help. Should be doable for the you now, right Ichirou?"<br/>
<br/>
I understand that the thing Kagura is referring to can be done.<br/>
<br/>
"Everyone, will you lend me your strength?"<br/>
<br/>
The girls replied unanimously to that question with an obvious answer.<br/>
<br/>
Unit Creation--Familiar Gods.<br/>
<br/>
I made the girls big enough to fight Chaos, and handed them copied Moon Drawn Swords and weapons transformed from those swords.<br/>
<br/>
"Let's do this."<br/>
"""OU"""<br/>
<br/>
A rainbow-colored storm swept over, golden sparks flew everywhere in space.<br/>
<br/>
After brute forcing our way through numbers, Chaos finally suffered wounds all over its body.<br/>
Gouged down to its bones, Chaos roared out like it was screaming.<br/>
<br/>
Is it thanks to ether that sounds get transmitted in a vacuum space?<br/>
<br/>
"Ah! It's running away!"<br/>
<br/>
Chaos ran off toward the deep space while purging down its crumbling body.<br/>
<br/>
"Tama won't let you go~?"<br/>
"Pochi is a pro at playing tag nanodesu!"<br/>
<br/>
Tama and Pochi ran after it at light speed, blocking Chaos's way.<br/>
<br/>
Chaos ran even faster while screaming out.<br/>
<br/>
"Chasing that thing all over the place would be bothersome."<br/>
"Well then, let's finish it off with a Map Weapon."<br/>
"Good idea."<br/>
<br/>
The corner of Kagura's mouth lifted up gleefully.<br/>
<br/>
"Pochi, Tama, come back here."<br/>
<br/>
I got them back here, would be disastrous if they got swept up in it.<br/>
<br/>
"I'll go first."<br/>
<br/>
I gather the enormous divinity sleeping inside my soul on my palm.<br/>
Recreating the image of 'most powerful' I carry in me.<br/>
<br/>
--Meteor Shower.<br/>
<br/>
Innumerable meteors showed up out of nowhere, raining down upon Chaos.<br/>
Tens of thousands meteors tore apart Chaos's layered barriers, drilling its bare body full of holes.<br/>
<br/>
Its clone bodies ran off by using its real body as a scapegoat, but Meteor Shower did not overlook that and turned those clones to space seaweed.<br/>
<br/>
"Still clinging on to dear life after all that huh..."<br/>
<br/>
Chaos that had been completely obliterated along with its clone bodies is beginning to regenerate.<br/>
<br/>
Rainbow lights are overflowing next to me.<br/>
<br/>
The light wrapping Kagura's Dragon God body shined even brighter, rainbow lights gather inside her greatly opened jaws.<br/>
<br/>
A moment later, a flash of light dyed the space rainbow.<br/>
<br/>
In godly vision unaffected by light, I saw Chaos getting erased away by Kagura's breath, evaporating even its body that had spread into adjacent worlds.<br/>
<br/>

<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
"--It's regenerating?"<br/>
<br/>
Chaos that should have been completely obliterated has started to regenerate back.<br/>
<br/>
"This is why I detest this thing. It's way too tenacious despite being so weak."<br/>
"Let's just dump it away then."<br/>
<br/>
Using Unit Arrangement, I move us all including Chaos to the center of the galaxy.<br/>
<br/>
"Beau~tiful~?"<br/>
"""So pretty""" "nanodesu!"<br/>
"That light is something vicious enough to utterly pulverize even the sun, let alone planets though."<br/>
<br/>
Everyone is watching a fountain of blue light gushing out of a black disc.<br/>
<br/>
"You gonna grind it down there?"<br/>
"It would just split apart and fly around everywhere if I did that--"<br/>
<br/>
I grabbed Chaos with my divinity, packed it down inside anti-god magic seals, then I sent it inside the black hole using sight-based Unit Arrangement.<br/>
<br/>
It shouldn't be possible for it to get out of that so long as it doesn't have foul play skills like Unit Arrangement.<br/>
Even if it managed to, it should take thousands, ten thousands of years.<br/>
<br/>
"Most revived adversaries get a power up though."<br/>
<br/>
Arisa, don't set up some weird flag please.<br/>
<br/>
"Then we're just gonna get even stronger to deal with it."<br/>
<br/>
After saying that, I turned my back on the center of the galaxy and made my way back to our planet together with everyone.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
