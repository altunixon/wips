<br/>
A bit of a longer chapter. That queen scares me.<br/>
The Queen<br/>
"Master!?"<br/>
Firo holds me anxiously as I was covered in blood.<br/>
The shield changed to the Chimeric Viper Shield by itself.<br/>
"What horrible wounds! Someone! Help master!"<br/>
A woman who looks like the commander of the punitive force runs towards Firo who was calling for help.<br/>
"Mother!?"<br/>
Melty exclaims in surprise towards the commander.<br/>
That reminds me……. The head of the punitive force looks like the person that was with Melty in the beginning.<br/>
I couldn’t get a good look because of the fan though.<br/>
"Your efforts this time were quite amazing. Hero of the Shield-sama."<br/>
It might be because of her that the pope was trapped.<br/>
"Everybody! Treatment for Hero of the Shield-sama is top priority! This is a royal order. We must save Hero of the shield-sama’s life Without fail !"<br/>
"""Yes Ma’am!"""<br/>
The treatment team within the punitive force gathered around me and began chanting magic.<br/>
"Doraifa ・ Heal"<br/>
Light surrounds me.<br/>
However……There is no sign of the pain receding.<br/>
"Ar-are you cursed?…… For it to be so strong……"<br/>
The treatment team cast de-curse magic with surprised expressions.<br/>
But…… It had no effect.<br/>
"Do a thorough examination! Everyone please hurry!"<br/>
The queen issues instructions to the treatment team and Firo follows hastily.<br/>
"Ugh……"<br/>
My whole body is screaming in pain. But I will not lose consciousness here.<br/>
Because I still do not know whether or not the queen is friend or foe.<br/>
"Y-you are the queen?"<br/>
"Yes, I am the queen of Melromark, Mirelia Q Melromark. I’m sorry for helping so late."<br/>
(Tl note: I have corrected Merlot Mark to Melromark and removed the = since they are just spaces.)<br/>
"……You were definitely slow."<br/>
What does it matter.<br/>
Do you have power? Are you the true ruler of this country?<br/>
Do you even see the big picture behind this event?<br/>
there are a mountain of things I want to say.<br/>
My grudge towards her daughter and trash start to surface.<br/>
"Really……this time was all my fault."<br/>
"Mother……"<br/>
"Mama, why are you apologizing to such a person!?"<br/>
When the bitch impeached, I could see a few veins appear on the queen’s smiling face.<br/>
"Malty…… Prepare yourself because there are a lot of things I need to say to you after we return to the castle."<br/>
Gogogo……. The air trembles.<br/>
Though I’m not the one that this anger is directed at, a chill still runs up my spine.<br/>
With the snap of her finger a shadow appears behind the bitch and arrests her.<br/>
"Wait mama!"<br/>
"Silence this fool at once"<br/>
"Yes Ma’am!"<br/>
The bitch’s mouth is covered by a cloth.<br/>
"W-What are you doing to Mein!?"<br/>
"I am Mein……Malty’s mother. By my authority, the fight between heroes is finished until we get back to the castle. Let’s return to Melromarc castle and rest."<br/>
Motoyasu and the other heroes fall silent due to the queen’s aura of authority.<br/>
"Now then, Hero of the Shield-sama……No, Naofumi Iwatani-sama.Your treatment is our top priority, so please rest. Everything will be prepared immediately."<br/>
The treatment team starts bringing out various magic tools, medicines, and holy water to use on me.<br/>
I feel like an emergency patient in an ambulance from my world.<br/>
"But……"<br/>
Why did the queen come here? Various questions appear as to why she isn’t in the country south-west of us.<br/>
"I know what you want to ask. Why was I outside of the country for so long, why I am leading the punitive force, why did I not come defend you sooner?…… There are a lot of things I need to tell you. However, that can be settled after you are healed."<br/>
"Naofumi-sama!"<br/>
Raphtalia anxiously runs to my side while crying.<br/>
"I thought your heart stopped! Are you okay!?"<br/>
"Who……knows……"<br/>
I feel that I have suffered some grievous wounds.<br/>
My whole body seriously hurts, it would be too troublesome to stand up.<br/>
In her human form Firo and Melty come from the carriage.<br/>
"What terrible wounds……Hurry come over here."<br/>
One of the treatment team members see Firo’s burnt limbs and calls her over.<br/>
However, Firo doesn’t want to leave my side to receive their treatment because she is worried about my wounds.<br/>
"But, Master is……"<br/>
"It’s alright Firo, Naofumi-sama will be cured by these people. Go have your wounds healed."<br/>
Raphtalia gently strokes Firo’s head and whispers in an anxious voice.<br/>
"But……"<br/>
"Naofumi-sama would hate to see Firo getting a scar because of him."<br/>
Will you listen, Firo? She stares at me while tilting her neck.<br/>
Can’t be helped. Normally being so selfish and carefree, to be so anxious for my sake.<br/>
"I’ll be fine, so go over there."<br/>
I squeeze out some instructions for Firo. When Firo reluctantly left to receive healing the treatment member nodded at me.<br/>
The treatment team use different recovery magic that seems to be effective against the curse.<br/>
"What a strong curse!……"<br/>
Mutters one of the healers.<br/>
Yeah, this is certainly a strong curse.<br/>
It literally says Curse Series.<br/>
Since the it’s very effective, the price for using it is equally as high, such as directly receiving the curse myself.<br/>
It is very different from a mere spell.<br/>
"Prepare for Group Synthesis Magic [Sanctuary]"<br/>
Are you going to use that to remove the rest of Self-Burning Curse?<br/>
They aren’t believers of the Three Heroes Church right? Then What religion are they following?<br/>
It does not seem to be the Shield religion.<br/>
As I think about such things my eyelids become heavy and it starts getting dark.<br/>
"Naofumi-sama!"<br/>
"Naofumi!"<br/>
Raphtalia and Melty shake me awake.<br/>
"Yeah? What’s wrong?"<br/>
"Please stay conscious properly."<br/>
"What are you saying, it’s like you think I died."<br/>
Well, in this situation I certainly might die.<br/>
Though I have no intention to die in such a place, I am tired in various ways.<br/>
I want to sleep……just a little.<br/>
But, I can’t sleep yet. We are still far from the safety zone.<br/>
However, I am unable to do anything in my present state.<br/>
In that case……<br/>
"Raphtalia, if something happens run away with Melty on Firo."<br/>
"Understood. But I will be taking Naofumi-sama too. So no matter what, please wake up."<br/>
"Okay. I’ll just sleep a little…… if anything happens wake me up."<br/>
During this exchange a memory appears.<br/>
…… I remember it.<br/>
The story where Raphtalia still looked like a child and would always cry and scream at night.<br/>
Raphtalia had to be ordered to do everything back then.<br/>
"My bad. It looks like there’s no breakfast this time."<br/>
"……It’s fine. Because, this time I’ll defend Naofumi-sama while you sleep.<br/>
(Tl Note: Referring to where Raphtalia was crying and screaming at night by the river and Naofumi defended her all night from monsters)<br/>
After the conversation was over my consciousness went blank and I started dreaming.<br/>
It has been two days since then.<br/>
"Ugh……Heavy."<br/>
"Su……Su……"<br/>
"Munya……Master~"<br/>
"Heavy……Help…..Firo-chan……"<br/>
When I awake I see Raphtalia, Firo, and Melty all on my bed.<br/>
"What the hell is this! Get up!"<br/>
I wake the three of them up immediately and scold them.<br/>
Instead of them looking down, all three of them smiled.<br/>
I was told that I got urgently rushed to receive treatment in Melromarc Castle.<br/>
The curse caused by Blutopfer was very serious, and even specialized curse treatments couldn’t remove it completely.<br/>
Wh en I ask how to cure it, the answer I got was it cannot be cured by magic or medicine. It seems that the only way to cure it is through time.<br/>
But the burns and scratches were healed and my physical fitness has recovered, I just feel lethargic.<br/>
When I check my stats, everything except defence dropped by 30%.<br/>
It seems until Blutopfer’s curse is cured completely they will stay debuffed.<br/>
This is the price which I paid for meddling in troublesome things.<br/>
"So how long till I recover?"<br/>
"The rough estimate is a month for complete recovery."<br/>
A month huh……that’s long.<br/>
Will it happen before the wave?<br/>
That reminds me, I was unable to go to Silt Welt after all.<br/>
For the purpose of Raphtalia and Firo’s class up, we ended up in a strange position.<br/>
"How is your condition?"<br/>
While I was lamenting about the absurdity of the world, the queen came over and asked about my condition.<br/>
I do some stretches to show my body’s condition.<br/>
"……"<br/>
I feel that I can trust her a little since she gave instructions for my treatment even while I was unconscious.<br/>
The queen also asked the treatment team at the hospital how I was doing.<br/>
"I see. Then could you follow me?"<br/>
"Where are we going?"<br/>
"We are going to the castle."<br/>
The queen produces her fan and hides her face, generating a strange pressure.<br/>
"Mother is scary when she’s angry……"<br/>
Melty hides behind my back and starts trembling.<br/>
I feel an unpleasant atmosphere, is that anger?<br/>
"Are you going to execute me?"<br/>
"I will do no such thing. Iwatani-sama."<br/>
I feel her smiling as the atmosphere changes.<br/>
Does the fact that I wasn’t attacked in my sleep mean this is safe?<br/>
"I just think Iwatani-sama would like to witness what will happen. Hohoho."<br/>
"What do you intend to do?"<br/>
"Please come to the castle, I’m sure you will enjoy it. There are various things I need to talk to you about as well, shall I answer everything Iwatana-sama asks after that?"<br/>
It seems the queen has created a situation where I have no choice but to go to the castle.<br/>
She is necessary for me to prove my innocent, so there is no way I can refuse.<br/>
Well there is no reason to decline for now.<br/>
"I want to ask one thing."<br/>
"I would like to talk after we arrive at the castle but……what is it?"<br/>
"You……Did you send Melty to me so she would get involved in this incident?"<br/>
This is the problem I am worried about most.<br/>
Depending on the answer there is a possibility that all the heroes will be rounded up at the castle and gotten rid of, all according to the queen’s plan.<br/>
"……That concern is only a baseless fear. Would that be the correct answer?"<br/>
"Eh!?"<br/>
Melty trembling while staring at her mother.<br/>
"Melty didn’t say it, but she wanted to meet her father so much that she couldn’t sleep at night. So I let her be selfish and meet him."<br/>
Meeting that trash. I was feeling uneasy when I thought the queen sent Melty to meet him.<br/>
" There is nothing to worry about. When such a thing happened I told shadow my ideas."<br/>
"Idea?"<br/>
"Yes, I entrusted Melty to the Hero of the sHield, if he tried to murder her then he would have been arrested."<br/>
The queen snaps her fingers.<br/>
Suddenly a group of assassins appear.<br/>
"What an annoying story."<br/>
"……I apologize to have troubled you. However, I think a lot of problems have been solved."<br/>
"That’s not it. What would you have done if Melty died!?"<br/>
I cannot hide my sympathy for Melty as she looks down sadly.<br/>
"There were always two bodyguards following her and supporting Iwatani-sama in various ways."<br/>
"I see……"<br/>
"For example, the one knight who tried to assassinate her."<br/>
One of the shadows transforms into the shape of a knight, just like that anime with the phantom theif!<br/>
"Villager."<br/>
One of the villagers who helped us in village to the east.<br/>
"Merchant from neighbouring country."<br/>
Even the guys from the neighbouring country that thanked me……<br/>
Certainly, it was strange for a person from the neighbouring country to show up there.<br/>
"I’ll explain the circumstances later. Do you still doubt me even after the shadow appeared when Melty was truly in danger?"<br/>
That reminds me…… a shadow did appear when the Church ambushed us.<br/>
However, that was a really dangerous situation so I couldn’t think straight.<br/>
Firo and I were the only ones able to nullify the Three Heroes Church shadow’s poison…….<br/>
"Mother…… did you know I might have been killed?"<br/>
"It was a possibility."<br/>
Melty hangs her head when the queen answers flatly.<br/>
well, as expected of the parent of bitch and wife of trash.Quite suitable to being a bad person.<br/>
"Are you people really parents?"<br/>
"I cannot argue about that even if I am one. There are a lot of lies that can be told……Let’s see. Do you understand what it takes to be queen of such a country for years?"<br/>
Well……Even if I impeach I don’t understand.<br/>
This fellow. I can only agree that she is trash’s wife.<br/>
"But……I believed in Iwatani-sama. Is that a suitable answer?"<br/>
"……Coward."<br/>
"Otherwise I cannot protect this country."<br/>
"Hah……Wouldn’t it be better if you didn’t arrive?"<br/>
"Naofumi-sama!?"<br/>
Raphtalia speaks anxiously.<br/>
"It seems you are unable to refute it. I won’t spread it. In the first place, if we were enemies I would not have received treatment."<br/>
"Yes, certainly, I think you would want to be present for what is about to happen."<br/>
If we share a mutual interest, then there would be no problems in lending a hand.<br/>
I don’t know what you are after, but if necessary I will use the Wrath Shield again.<br/>
"I brought the carriage of the holy bird here. Let’s return with the luggage."<br/>
"Really!?"<br/>
At the queen’s words Firo steps forwards.<br/>
"Yes of course. It’s in front of the hospital, please confirm it."<br/>
"Yay~! Mel-chan! Let’s go!"<br/>
"Okay!"<br/>
Firo and Melty run out of the room together.<br/>
She really loves that carriage huh.<br/>
After watching the both of them run off, I stare at the queen.<br/>
"I feel disgusted."<br/>
Although I have received some goodwill, I do not know her real intentions.<br/>
The queen antagonized the Three Heroes Church, and furthermore treated the devil of the shield favourably, I wish to know why.<br/>
I can’t even think of a reason.<br/>
I do not believe in some noble reason such as fighting the wave together.<br/>
Or is there still information that I am lacking?<br/>
"I have a goal. I will use any means necessary to achieve it. Although the way we go about things is different, I believe I have the same feelings as Iwatani-sama."<br/>
Similar feelings as me…….<br/>
I don’t know why, but I feel that I somewhat understand.<br/>
After coming to this world, I have experienced various things.<br/>
At least this person is talking to me as an equal.<br/>
"I will follow your instructions for now."<br/>
"I am grateful. Iwantani-sama."<br/>
After obtaining my consent, the queen smiles.<br/>
The smile has a strong will mixed in.<br/>
"Auckley……Malty……. This isn’t over yet……."<br/>
(Tl note: Auckley = trashking for those who forgot.)<br/>
