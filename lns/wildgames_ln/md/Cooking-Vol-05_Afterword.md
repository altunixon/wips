Thank you, everyone, for purchasing the fifth volume of "Cooking with Wild Game".<br/>
In a blink of an eye, five volumes have been published.<br/>
The last volume was published just three months ago, but it still felt so quick.<br/>
Following the last volume, the story this time describes Asuta’s business in the Post Station Town.<br/>
Some readers will read the afterword first so I won’t mention the details, but I hope everyone can appreciate how hard and tenacious Asuta’s work ethics are.<br/>
I mentioned in the past afterwords that this story is first posted on a website. When it comes to publishing in volumes, I’m always troubled by where to stop the story.<br/>
Even when the story is at a stopping point, there is still a need to reduce the word count to compile it into a volume. Hence, I’m always troubled by the need to edit things.<br/>
I needed to cut out tens of thousands of words in this volume alone.<br/>
In terms of page count, that is 46 pages worth of words.<br/>
As you might imagine, when the story is serialized on the web, I will always write as I wish and tend to drone on. Because of this tendency of mine, editing my work will help to reduce descriptions that are too long.<br/>
Because I needed to cut out tens of thousands of words, I removed a certain key dialogue scene. If there is a chance, I hope to insert it into a future volume.<br/>
Other than that, I also edited many places to make the passages read better.<br/>
However, it will be detrimental if I cut away the interesting passages too. So this isn’t an easy task.<br/>
In order to let the readers who got into this story through the published books or from the web enjoy this series, I did the best I can. Is the story satisfying to you? I hope my efforts yield good results.<br/>
Everyone can guess who the main character of the new short story is from the title, correct?<br/>
This character appeared in the previous few volumes, and I’m elated to see her featured in the colored illustrations for this volume.<br/>
When I first drafted the concept of this character, I didn’t expect her to play such a large role in the story. She isn’t as energetic as the Wu clan four sisters, but I hope everyone likes her too.<br/>
I would also like to inform everyone that, starting from the fifth volume, the cover art will change a little.<br/>
The fifth volume also has its scenes depicted in the style of a photo. However, starting from this volume, I decided to emphasize more on the 「expression of a concept」.<br/>
Up until volume four, the cover was mainly 「scenes that happened in the story」, but that might not necessarily apply from this volume onwards.<br/>
Specifically speaking, the scene depicted on the cover of volume five isn’t described in this volume.<br/>
I might have the chance to describe the scene happening on the cover in future volumes, but that won’t happen for volume 5. I intentionally let the cover show a scene that wasn’t mentioned in the volume.<br/>
Actually, when planning the cover of the past four volumes, instead of staying faithful to the story, I have always placed more emphasis on the 「expression of a concept」.<br/>
Using Asuta and Ai Fa from volume one as examples, Asuta didn’t wear a bandana while he was cooking. That’s because I wanted everyone to see 「Asuta’s expression」 clearly. They both wore shoes despite being indoors because I wanted everyone to know 「what their attire is like」.<br/>
The cover is the 「face」 of the story, so I think 「expression of a concept」 is very important.<br/>
The scene on the cover this time is 「Denizens of the Forest’s Edge Rimee Wu and Lala Wu enjoying a meal together with Tara from Post Station Town」.<br/>
Will the Forest’s Edge welcome a peaceful future? I hope everyone can continue to support this work.<br/>
Well then, I will sign off with the usual. My deepest thanks to my editor from HOBBY JAPAN, the illustrator Kochimo-sensei, all the staff who helped in the publishing of this volume, and all the readers who bought this book.<br/>
I hope to meet everyone again in the next volume!<br/>
