Chapter 366: Paranoia Begets Paranoia<br/>
"Anyways, for now…"<br/>
When I looked to see what Fohl was doing, I saw he was being hard pressed by an imitation of Atlas.<br/>
"Onii-sama, you’re in the way."<br/>
"Ku…" (Fohl)<br/>
As if she could see, the fake followed Fohl’s movements with her eyes while she one-sidedly attacked Fohl, who was on the defense.<br/>
She looks a little more childish than the real one, and a little bit prettied up.<br/>
What’s more, her breasts are strangely large.<br/>
Was someone’s wishes mixed into this one?<br/>
The Shield lets out a pinging sound.<br/>
Ah, so you want me to go there.<br/>
I lightly jump towards them, instantly arrive at the fake attacking Fohl, and grab her head with one hand.<br/>
"Onii-sama, are you telling me you can’t differentiate between the real me and an imposter?"<br/>
"!?"<br/>
Atlas exposes herself from the Shield, and begins glaring at Fohl.<br/>
And Fohl’s eyes expand as if he’s witnessing a portrait of hell.<br/>
Well, being attacked by comrades revived from the dead is a sort of Hell in itself.<br/>
"If you can’t tell a fake like this from me, I’ll scorn you."<br/>
"Move aside, ugly!" (Nise Atlas)<br/>
"You’re not Atlas! Atlas would never talk to Aniki like that!" (Fohl)<br/>
Fake Atlas begins to abuse me.<br/>
At the same time, Fohl swings his fist towards her.<br/>
「Dragon of Ruin Inferno Fist X」,<br/>
「Vicious Tiger Piercing Foot X」!<br/>
Calling out finishers one after the other, Fohl aims kicking skills on the fake Atlas.<br/>
His attacks are deciding this.<br/>
Fake Atlas unsteadily retreats a few steps, before muttering.<br/>
"H-how foolish."<br/>
Oh… like the Demi-Human Shadow I defeated once before, her body turns black before she completely fades away.<br/>
I guess that’s a fake for ya.<br/>
The real Atlas would have been able to dodge that.<br/>
"Good grief… it seems Onii-sama hasn’t changed at all."<br/>
"Atlas… and Aniki?" (Fohl)<br/>
"Yeah." (Naofumi)<br/>
"Are you… real?" (Fohl)<br/>
"It seems there was a Fake Atlas here. Did that Goddess look through someone’s head and make it?" (Naofumi)<br/>
It seemed to have no standard of quality.<br/>
That was probably what Fohl once desired.<br/>
Though that is questionable in itself.<br/>
"Aniki, what happened? Atlas too." (Fohl)<br/>
"This and that. I’ll explain it in detail later, but now…" (Naofumi)<br/>
On top of being fused with the Spirit of the Shield, various powers from various worlds have been injected into her, so Atlas was able to show herself.<br/>
Seeing Atlas, Fohl rushed over to her with teary eyes.<br/>
"Atlas!" (Fohl)<br/>
"Ah, Onii-sama." (Atlas)<br/>
Fohl tried to hug her, but he merely passed through.<br/>
She’s a mixture of a spirit, and a soul, so holding her may prove to be a bit difficult.<br/>
I guess if I had to say, Atlas is currently the highest level form of a ghost.<br/>
"I have no body, so it’s impossible." (Atlas)?<br/>
"A-Atlas!" (Fohl)<br/>
"Ah, but I can touch Naofumi-sama, you know." (Atlas)<br/>
Atlas starts nuzzling me.<br/>
Please stop doing things to provoke people…<br/>
I mean, Fohl’s finally started to get around to calling me Aniki. What are you trying to do by turning him hostile?<br/>
"Gununu…" (Fohl)<br/>
"Don’t make such a jealous face. Oy, oy, don’t cry, it’s alright." (Naofumi)<br/>
Perhaps he’s become overcome with emotions on having met his deceased sister. Fohl breaks into tears.<br/>
When Atlas is around, he really turns into an idiotic brother.<br/>
"Aniki!" (Fohl)<br/>
"What? By the way, I’m not a fake." (Naofumi)<br/>
"Aniki!" (Fohl)<br/>
Fohl clings to me.<br/>
I don’t really enjoy being embraced by guys, but… I guess it’s fine for today.<br/>
I mean, he seems to be happy.<br/>
Even so, Firo and Melty won’t come closer to hug me.<br/>
And their treating me as a mysterious enemy.<br/>
I’m well aware they have their reasons, but I’ll remember this.<br/>
"You survived!" (Fohl)<br/>
"Pretty much. But I’m about to burst into tears because no one believes me." (Naofumi)<br/>
While that conversation was going on…<br/>
"Ara ara, if it isn’t a little visitor from hell."<br/>
Medea instantly appears in the air above us. She calmly starts talking to us.<br/>
"I was sure I had killed you, but you’re surprisingly tough." (Medea)<br/>
"It was just a bit of a miracle. Luck was on my side, and I was able to survive your attack." (Naofumi)<br/>
"…"<br/>
She seems to be laughing, but she’s also thinking about something.<br/>
I assume she’s figuring out that I was saved by what the God Slayer left behind.<br/>
She’s not wrong, or anything.<br/>
But I don’t think she’ll be able to figure out I’ve become a being close to her.<br/>
IF she had, she would have immediately erased me with a conceptual attack, or something.<br/>
If that happened, I would immediately counterattack, though.<br/>
I’ve even made countermeasures for that attack.<br/>
With the long time I’ve spent, I’ve thought long and hard about defeating her.<br/>
But to do that, I’ll need to stall for a bit more time.<br/>
Honestly, it’s best to think that I have absolutely no means of attacking until Raphtalia gets here.<br/>
"No matter. I’ll retreat for today. Offer as many thank as you want to your miracle. I was just getting bored, but now it seems we can play a little longer." (Medea)<br/>
Medea snaps her fingers.<br/>
And the Reincarnators that had been on the field, as well as their comrades, the enemy soldiers disappeared in an instant.<br/>
"Well then, let’s play some more games tomorrow. Goodbye." (Medea)<br/>
Just as with when she appeared, she vanished in an instant.<br/>
It appears that she’s really gone.<br/>
Even so, games…<br/>
So this battle is nothing more but a bit of fun for her.<br/>
Damn her! Well, I’ll let her have fun with her games for now.<br/>
We just have to be the ones preparing for battle.<br/>
"Well then, isn’t it about time… you stop looking at me like that?" (Naofumi)<br/>
Starting with Melty, even Firo is vigilant of my presence. It’s an unpleasant feeling.<br/>
"Firo? You don’t recognize me?" (Naofumi)<br/>
"Um, you’re probably Master, Firo think. But like Mel-chan’s mom, and the Musou Grandma, you may be being controlled after death, Firo thinks." (Firo)<br/>
I let out a deep sigh.<br/>
Ah… this world really is crappy.<br/>
It never lets things go my way.<br/>
The second I get here, I’m already getting regrets.<br/>
Can’t this world get destroyed already? Not that I’ll let it.<br/>
"N-Naofumi-san!?"<br/>
Itsuki and Rishia ran over.<br/>
The enemy had completely disappeared, so it’s natural that he reunited with the main forces.<br/>
"Yo, Itsuki. You sure worked hard. And, I understand that you may be wary of me, but please believe me." (Naofumi)<br/>
Itsuki seems half in doubt as he stares at me.<br/>
I think he’ll be a reliable comrade, but it’s troubling that he’s approaching bow in hand.<br/>
"Itsuki! It’s been a while!"<br/>
"Um… who is that over there? He looks kinda like Ren." (Itsuki)<br/>
"Yeah, that’s Ren. Before coming back here, he spent two whole years in his original world." (Naofumi)<br/>
"Eh!?" (Itsuki)<br/>
Itsuki’s face is colored with surprise.<br/>
I mean, even I was quite shocked at it.<br/>
"I know it may be a bit much to believe us here." (Naofumi)<br/>
Female Knight is still giving Ren a suspicious look.<br/>
Ren is trying to find words to return.<br/>
But that Bitch Goddess really never does anything decent.<br/>
"Rafu~."<br/>
"Oh? If it isn’t Raph-chan." (Naofumi)<br/>
If even Raph-chan was wary of me, I’d get depressed, but Raph-chan lovingly brushes up against my side.<br/>
Oh… It seems the ones here who believe me are only Raph-chan and Fohl.<br/>
I’ll give him a lot of pats.<br/>
"Aniki is the real deal. I can tell that he’s not being used." (Fohl)<br/>
"That’s right. It is exceedingly unpleasant to see you handle Naofumi-sama like that." (Atlas)<br/>
"Looking closely, that Atlas-chan. She doesn’t have a body?"<br/>
"I kinda became one with the Spirit of the Shield. I’m different from some fake that was made with someone’s memories at the base, right?" (Atlas)<br/>
Seeing Atlas distance herself from Fohl, Melty and Firo drop their guard.<br/>
Is that really enough to convince them?<br/>
"It’s not like I believe you, or anything, you got that!?" (Melty)<br/>
"Ah, yes, got it." (Naofumi)<br/>
Paranoia really is something else.<br/>
"I know how things generally progressed, but I’d like the specifics." (Naofumi)<br/>
"Um, so Naofumi. Raphtalia-san is…" (Melty)<br/>
Troubled with how to ask the question, Melty tries talking to me.<br/>
It’s not strange for them to think she died with me back then.<br/>
"She’s in the middle of another job. Just like we brought Ren, she’s off to go drag Motoyasu here." (Naofumi)<br/>
"Really!?"<br/>
Hmm? They were listening in? Midori and the other two draw closer.<br/>
These guys love Motoyasu. It’s probably best if I tell them.<br/>
"Is Motoyasu-san alive as well?" (Midori)<br/>
"Yep, he’s still kicking. It seems he was sent to a world parallel this one, so finding him was quite a trial." (Naofumi)<br/>
"So Mokkun isn’t in his original world?" (Kuu)<br/>
"That seems to be the case. I thought I would try searching his world, but I got a response from him around here." (Naofumi)<br/>
"Where’s this parallel world? Is that where Mou-chan is?" (Marin)<br/>
"It’s hard to explain. It’s a different world almost exactly the same as this one, to put it simply." (Naofumi)<br/>
"Different, and yet the same?"<br/>
"If, at that time… wait, that guy can have regret? If, at that time, he had a regret, and wanted to make another choice, then he’s in a world where that can happen." (Naofumi)<br/>
Midori, Firo and the other Filo Rials tilt their heads.<br/>
They’re definitely not getting any of this.<br/>
But Midori is supposed to be smarter than Firo, so I think he understands more. He mutters to himself before seemingly accepting it.<br/>
"To put it so Future Queen of the Filo Rials, Firo, can understand it, there’s a world where you never met Naofumi-san, and you were born and raised as a normal Filo Rial." (Midori)<br/>
"Really?" (Firo)<br/>
"That’s how it is." (Naofumi)<br/>
"Hmm?" (Firo)<br/>
Firo tilts her head again.<br/>
With her head, I think it’ll be impossible to get this through.<br/>
Well, that’s just how she is.<br/>
I really don’t want to meet a smart Firo someday.<br/>
"Anyways, there’s no need for us to stand around here to talk. Shouldn’t we return to somewhere safe?" (Naofumi)<br/>
I mean, we already intercepted the enemy.<br/>
"… Understood. Let’s leave this to a person who can determine whether this Naofumi is real or fake. Until then, we’ll put that matter on hold." (Melty)<br/>
"There’s someone who can do that?" (NAofumi)<br/>
What a convenient special ability.<br/>
Does that mean there’s a reincarnator on our side?<br/>
"What are you talking about? It’s Sadina-san." (Melty)<br/>
Ah, Sadina.<br/>
Does she have the ability to determine my authenticity?<br/>
No… I’ve been with her for a long time, so perhaps she can.<br/>
There’s no helping it. If that’s what it takes to get them to believe me, I’ll undertake Sadina’s appraisal.<br/>
And like that, we left Melromark’s battlefield, and started moving towards the Castle Town.<br/>
