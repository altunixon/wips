<br/>
I am dreaming.<br/>
I am in a space of nothing.<br/>
How many times is this now? I am already getting used to this sight.<br/>
But this time around it was a little different.<br/>
"……"<br/>
The Goddess that normally welcomed me with a smile had her hands on her waist and glaring at me.<br/>
Uhm, are you angry?<br/>
"Hey." (Noah)<br/>
Noah-sama’s voice is cold.<br/>
"Do you remember what was the first thing I asked of you?" (Noah)<br/>
"Uhm…" (Makoto)<br/>
If I remember correctly…<br/>
"Get strong?" (Makoto)<br/>
"Right." (Noah)<br/>
The face of a squinting Goddess-sama is pretty nice.<br/>
"Idiot." (Noah)<br/>
She retorted to my heart’s mutter.<br/>
"Remember what I said next?" (Noah)<br/>
"Ah, yes yes." (Makoto)<br/>
Good luck, right?<br/>
Ah, before that, she told me she had high hopes for me.<br/>
"You don’t remember!" (Noah)<br/>
Goddess-sama flails her arms and goes ‘kiiih!’.<br/>
"I told you that you are my only believer, so I wouldn’t forgive you if you died!" (Noah)<br/>
"Aah." (Makoto)<br/>
Right right. Eh?<br/>
"…Could it be…" (Makoto)<br/>
I could feel the blood draining from my face.<br/>
"I…am dead?" (Makoto)<br/>
"Haah, you really push yourself too hard." (Noah)<br/>
Noah-sama snaps her fingers and a monitor appears in midair.<br/>
"Here, look." (Noah)<br/>
That magic is cool.<br/>
That monitor is showing the state of everyone.<br/>
"Right now your priest friend is doing her best in healing you." (Noah)<br/>
"Makoto! Hey! Makoto, are you okay?!" (Lucy)<br/>
"Lucy! Calm down. He has lost consciousness, but he is still breathing. First we need to provide emergency treatment, and head to a hospital immediately." (Emily)<br/>
"Makoto, don’t die! We are arriving to the city real soon!!" (Jean)<br/>
Jean is carrying me, and Emily is casting healing magic on me.<br/>
Lucy seems to be panicking quite a lot.<br/>
I am sorry, everyone. Making you guys worry like this.<br/>
"It was thanks to you that the Griffon was defeated, so of course they would get desperate to save the one who saved them." (Noah)<br/>
I see. At any rate, I am glad everyone is okay.<br/>
"Noah-sama, I am sorry. I was way too reckless today. I was about to die there." (Makoto)<br/>
"You really are an idiot. Today’s injuries normally would have killed you!" (Noah)<br/>
"Eh?!" (Makoto)<br/>
What do you mean by that?<br/>
"Look at this." (Noah)<br/>
Noah-sama showed me a Soul Book.<br/>
"Wait, isn’t that mine? Please don’t take it without my permission." (Makoto)<br/>
"That much should be okay. We are buddies here, right? More importantly, look at this." (Noah)<br/>
She wraps her arms around my shoulders and pulls me close.<br/>
Wait, too close.<br/>
"Now now, look." (Noah)<br/>
Goddess-sama sticks even closer.<br/>
I look at the Soul Book while activating [Clear Mind].<br/>
Goddess Noah’s Divine Protection.<br/>
Those words were added.<br/>
"This is…" (Makoto)<br/>
"Huhum, you did it, Makoto! Thanks to your everyday prayers, you managed to gain a divine protection! Thanks to that, you were able to resist the attack of the Griffon and the fire magic." (Noah)<br/>
When you get the divine protection of a Goddess, the believer gets a strong power, and there’s times when it might make their body sturdier.<br/>
Looks like I was saved today thanks to that.<br/>
"I see…" (Makoto)<br/>
It has been long.<br/>
It has been 1 year and several months since I came to this world.<br/>
I feel like I have finally gotten a bit closer to where my classmates are.<br/>
"You seem to be happy. This isn’t all I wanted to tell you." (Noah)<br/>
"There’s something else?" (Makoto)<br/>
"Look at this!" (Noah)<br/>
What Noah-sama pointed at read [Spirit User].<br/>
"Spirit User?" (Makoto)<br/>
If I remember correctly, it is a skill elves and dwarves have.<br/>
Lucy had it too.<br/>
"That’s right! We Titan Gods get along well with the Spirits after all! This is a Gift Skill of a Goddess." (Noah)<br/>
"Spirit User…Spirits, huh." (Makoto)<br/>
There were no users of that in the Water Temple.<br/>
Or more like, there’s no users of that in the human race.<br/>
It is a minor magic that elves use minutely.<br/>
"Oh, not happy?" (Noah)<br/>
"No no, that’s not it!" (Makoto)<br/>
I am not dissatisfied, but I just don’t know if it is strong or not, and it seems like those feelings leaked out.<br/>
"I will use them gratefully, Goddess-sama." (Makoto)<br/>
"Fufu, devout yourself from here on as well." (Noah)<br/>
She patted my head.<br/>
Light wraps around my body.<br/>
"Makoto, looks like it is about time to wake up." (Noah)<br/>
Noah-sama smiles kindly.<br/>
"Thank you very much, Goddess-sama. Also, is it okay to invite Lucy to be your believer, Noah-sama?" (Makoto)<br/>
"Hmm, invite, huh." (Noah)<br/>
Eh? She doesn’t seem to be that happy.<br/>
"Actually, I can only get 1 believer every 10 years as punishment for going against the God Realm, you know." (Noah)<br/>
"Eeeh." (Makoto)<br/>
Then I can’t invite anyone.<br/>
"Well, I am fine just having Makoto." (Noah)<br/>
Noah-sama gives me a thumbs up and winks.<br/>
Aren’t you a bit too at ease?<br/>
"It is okay, it is okay. Now then, don’t push yourself too much, okay?" (Noah)<br/>
"Yes, take care, Noah-sama." (Makoto)<br/>
"See ya~." (Noah)<br/>
I was covered in light.<br/>
◇◇<br/>
 <br/>
"Makoto-kun, how are you feeling?"<br/>
When I woke up, I was at the treatment room of the Guild.<br/>
Emily was by my side.<br/>
"Good morning. How long was I unconscious for?" (Makoto)<br/>
"Half a day. It is already night." (Emily)<br/>
I slowly lift my body.<br/>
I asked about what happened after defeating the Griffon.<br/>
When they told the guild that we defeated a Griffon, since it was subjugated by 4 bronze rank adventurers, the guild had fallen into a big ruckus.<br/>
Especially Lucy who weakened the Griffon with her fire magic and Jean who finished it; they were heroes for a day.<br/>
The entrance is currently a festival.<br/>
The ogre subjugation was the same. Adventurers really like making noise.<br/>
On the other hand, Emily was currently treating my burns.<br/>
I am currently in a mummified state.<br/>
"My whole body itches." (Makoto)<br/>
"That’s proof that you are healing, so endure it." (Emily)<br/>
Being told that, I have no choice but to endure.<br/>
"Can I move?" (Makoto)<br/>
"You should be resting right now, but you sleep at the guild, right?" (Emily)<br/>
"Yeah, I don’t think I will be able to sleep with this noise. I am gonna show my face to everyone." (Makoto)<br/>
"Then I will tag along. I do have to go get Jean after all." (Emily)<br/>
"Makoto!" (Lucy)<br/>
On my way to the entrance, Lucy came flying at us.<br/>
Her face is red.<br/>
She must have been made to drink quite a lot.<br/>
"Hey! Is your body okay? Is it okay to not be sleeping?" (Lucy)<br/>
"It is so noisy I can’t." (Makoto)<br/>
They are currently having a big party at the entrance.<br/>
Jean is surrounded by adventurers and going ‘wai wai’.<br/>
There’s also a whole lot of female adventurers drawing close to him.<br/>
He is popular.<br/>
"That Jean!" (Emily)<br/>
Emily plunged into that circle.<br/>
She is pulling away the female adventurers clinging to Jean.<br/>
It is someone else’s business, but you really have it tough.<br/>
"Hey, Makoto…" (Lucy)<br/>
Lucy’s eyes were wet, and she grabbed my right hand.<br/>
"Are you really okay? You were unconscious this whole time." (Lucy)<br/>
"Yeah, I woke up just now. More importantly, you are the hero today, right? Go celebrate with the others." (Makoto)<br/>
"I am fine! I actually wanted to be by your side, but Emily told me I wouldn’t be of use, and Lucas-san told me it wouldn’t be fun without the main cast. Everyone was making me drink and it was a pain!" (Lucy)<br/>
She puffed her cheeks in anger, but it seems like she had a decent amount of fun.<br/>
She probably hasn’t had this much attention before.<br/>
"H-Hey, Makoto…" (Lucy)<br/>
Lucy asks me hesitantly.<br/>
"Are you angry about today?" (Lucy)<br/>
"About what?" (Makoto)<br/>
"My magic severely injured you…" (Lucy)<br/>
"Aah, I am at fault there. Even though I was taught in the temple that I shouldn’t Synchronize if I don’t have the affinity." (Makoto)<br/>
"It is true that if you don’t have the affinity, it doesn’t go well, but having your whole body burn like this time is actually not something that should happen…" (Lucy)<br/>
Lucy’s face is grim.<br/>
I wonder why…<br/>
I feel like she isn’t just talking about how she doesn’t want me to be injured.<br/>
"Lucy?" (Makoto)<br/>
Lucy raises her head and mutters.<br/>
"It is probably because of the demon blood inside me…" (Lucy)<br/>
