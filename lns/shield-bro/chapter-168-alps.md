Chapter 168: Alps<br/>
"It seems… that an amazing granny has arrived." (Fohl)<br/>
Fohl arrives carrying Atlas on his back.<br/>
He’s acting as if he is uninvolved.<br/>
Rafatalia and the others have a level cap of 100, but these two can reach 120.<br/>
It’s true that having technique can balance out having low stats, but having high stats never hurts.<br/>
"What are you talking about? You’re taking her lessons as well." (Naofumi)<br/>
"Ge…" (Fohl)<br/>
Fohl has recently been preoccupied with tending to Atlas, and he’s been ignoring my orders.<br/>
I don’t know why, but he is behaving quite rebelliously towards me like Kiel when she first got here.<br/>
I was able to tame Kiel with food, but it seems that won’t work on this one.<br/>
The younger sister Atlas’s condition has improved quite a bit, and it seems a full recovery may be possible.<br/>
"Naofumi-sama, it’s been a while." (Atlas)<br/>
"It’s only been two and a half days, you know." (Naofumi)<br/>
"And still we meet here and now. Naofumi-sama suddenly left, so I was feeling… anxious." (Atlas)<br/>
Ah, so she was afraid that her medicine supply had disappeared.<br/>
If I don’t feed it to her personally, the effect decreases.<br/>
"Nununu…" (Fohl)<br/>
Fohl begins staring at me menacingly.<br/>
What’s he so bitter about?<br/>
"HM? Oy, little girl over there." (Granny)<br/>
The Old Woman approaches Atlas.<br/>
She looks over her body.<br/>
Please choose one student at a time, or I will be understaffed.<br/>
"Laddy, why are you carrying that girl around?" (Granny)<br/>
She begins questioning Fohl.<br/>
And in response Fohl shifts his glare to her.<br/>
Isn’t it obvious that Atlas is sick?<br/>
From my point of view, it looks as if the granny is bullying the two siblings.<br/>
I’m quite skeptical when it comes to the elderly.<br/>
This trauma was probably brought about by Trash.<br/>
"Atlas can neither see nor walk!" (Fohl)<br/>
"Really? I don’t sense that sort of aura from her. Can you have her stand up for a second?" (Granny)<br/>
"D-don’t screw with me. Atlas can’t st-" (Fohl)<br/>
"Dear brother, let me try it." (Atlas)<br/>
"… I got it." (Fohl)<br/>
Fohl slowly lowers Atlas, and grasps her arms to steady her.<br/>
Well… I don’t think anything will come of this.<br/>
This may be a world of magic, but there are some wounds that won’t heal so easily.<br/>
"Naofumi-sama, if I may ask for your assistance." (Atlas)<br/>
"Ah, got it." (Naofumi)<br/>
She won’t be able to stand anyways. Someone with as weak a constitution as her won’t recover this fast.<br/>
… The Yggdrasil medicine can’t be that effective…<br/>
This old woman’s standing right in front of us.<br/>
Perhaps the medicine will work.<br/>
"Hup…" (Atlas)<br/>
Atlas uses me and Fohl’s hands, and manages to stand.<br/>
"Wow… Is this what it means to stand on one’s own feet?" (Atlas)<br/>
"Ah… Atlas is… Atlas is standing!" (Fohl)<br/>
What sort of girl from the Alps are you? (TL: Heidi reference)<br/>
… If I never asked Fohl for his name, I would have given him the nickname ‘Alps’ here.<br/>
And I would have stuck to it to the end. Like with Taniko.<br/>
Now that I whink about it, I don’t know Taniko’s real name. But I have no real intention to learn it, and I don’t really care.<br/>
Atlas slowly starts walking while teetering from side to side. She smiles.<br/>
"Thank you, Naofumi-sama, Onii-sama." (Atlas)<br/>
"… Atlas, you’ve become healthy…" (Fohl)<br/>
"Yes, Onii-sama." (Atlas)<br/>
Her condition was horrible, but she has recovered to this extent.<br/>
That medicine really is miraculous.<br/>
It worked for the Old Woman and now Atlas.<br/>
"And so Naofumi-sama… what should we do from now?" (Atlas)<br/>
"Let’s see. I plan to have your brother fight for me. He’s been leveling up with the others, right?" (Naofumi)<br/>
"Yes, Onii-sama has been diligently leveling with the others." (Atlas)<br/>
"So what do you want to do?" (Naofumi)<br/>
Even if she can walk, I don’t think I can count on her for hard labor.<br/>
Atlas is also a Hakuko, so she can reach level 120.<br/>
"I also wish to learn how to fight." (Atlas)<br/>
"Atlas! You don’t have to do that!" (Fohl)<br/>
Fohl of the Alps shouts out.<br/>
But of course he will prevent his sick sister from participating in battle.<br/>
"No… I’ve wished this since I was small. If I was ever able to walk, then I wouldn’t want to be the one who just got protected all the time. I want to protect you too." (Atlas)<br/>
"B-but…" (Fohl)<br/>
Atlas’s strong will seems to have gotten through to Alps.<br/>
… If I keep thinking of him as Alps, I may end up saying it out loud and getting whacked.<br/>
I’ll stick with Fohl for now.<br/>
Taniko? No idea.<br/>
"And so, Naofumi-sama, please let me fight as well… Please let me level up with everyone." (Atlas)<br/>
"Understood. So Fohl, what will you do?" (Naofumi)<br/>
"I’ll fight! Protecting Atlas is my duty." (Fohl)<br/>
"No, I wasn’t asking about that…"<br/>
I explained the powers granted unto me by my shield’s growth correction abilities.<br/>
"And so if you want to truly become stronger, it will probably be best to reset your level. What will you do?" (Naofumi)<br/>
"T-that’s…" (Fohl)<br/>
"With the Growth Corrections, Atlas may surpass you some day." (Naofumi)<br/>
My words seem to have affected him.<br/>
"I want to win against Onii-sama." (Atlas)<br/>
"Nu…" (Fohl)<br/>
Fohl hesitates and stares at Atlas’s face.<br/>
I guess it will be painful for him if his precious sister gets beat up on the battlefield. He seems to have come to a decision.<br/>
"… I got it. I’ll reset." (Fohl)<br/>
"You seem to be discussing something interesting." (Sadina)<br/>
Sadina suddenly appears.<br/>
"I wonder if I should do it as well." (Sadina)<br/>
"Fumu…" (Naofumi)<br/>
I was going to the Dragon Hourglass anyways, so I don’t mind.<br/>
"We’ll be leaving immediately. Military Instructor, please help Rafatalia and Rishia." (Naofumi)<br/>
"I understand." (Granny)<br/>
Sadina is large, so we’ll have to couple a cart to the carriage… Oh, right.<br/>
"Are the Lemos here?" (Naofumi)<br/>
"What is it?" (Lemo)<br/>
The Lemos gather.<br/>
"Are you people raising your levels as well?" (Naofumi)<br/>
"Yes, most of us were already over level 30 when we got here." (Imya’s Uncle)<br/>
Imya’s uncle begins explanations.<br/>
"I see, then anyone here who wants to learn blacksmithing, come with me." (NAofumi)<br/>
"Blacksmithery? Then I’ll go." (Imya’s Uncle)<br/>
Imya’s Uncle raises his hand.<br/>
What?<br/>
"I’ve already put the basics to heart." (Imya’s Uncle)<br/>
"I see, then come along." (Naofumi)<br/>
"Understood." (Imya’s Uncle)<br/>
"While we’re gone, everyone can dig burrows for themselves. Does anyone specialize in that field?" (Naofumi)<br/>
"Everyone is quite skilled in that aspect." (Imya’s Uncle)<br/>
"Got it." (Naofumi)<br/>
It seems that at least that area will finish without a hitch.<br/>
"Where is Imya, anyways?" (Naofumi)<br/>
"Imya is currently at the clothing maker’s place to learn how to make clothing. Is that alright with you?" (Imya’s Uncle)<br/>
"I have no issues. Tell her that she can learn freely." (Naofumi)<br/>
"Yes." (Imya’s Uncle)<br/>
Imya’s developed an interest in making clothes.<br/>
If I leave it to the Tailor, it should be fine.<br/>
It seems that the people of my village will finally be able to wear decent clothes soon.<br/>
"Oy, why are you wearing a loincloth?" (Naofumi)<br/>
Sadina appears wearing a loincloth. She’s also wearing a vest, but that doesn’t make her appearance any less strange.<br/>
She’s also given one to Kiel, and she walks around in it.<br/>
It’s aesthetically terrible. It’s up to Imya to prevent this town from turning into one of loincloths.<br/>
"Personal tastes." (Sadina)<br/>
Sadina offers a brief reply.<br/>
"I’m home~. Melty-chan was busy so she rejected me." (Firo)<br/>
Firo comes back from the neighboring village at the right time. I call her over.<br/>
"Then what shall I do?" (Atlas)<br/>
Atlas, who we are leaving behind calls out.<br/>
It’s good that she’s motivated to work.<br/>
Fohl is coming to the Castle Town with us to reset his level, but Atlas was level 1 from the beginning.<br/>
"Military Advisor, what do you think of this girl? Can we send her off to level in this state?" (Naofumi)<br/>
"… Her battle senses are of genius levels. She has learned to sense presence even without my teachings. It will be fine to throw her into battle now." (Granny)<br/>
"Quit spouting crap! Treat her more carefully!" (Fohl)<br/>
Fohl snapped.<br/>
Whenever I meet him he seems angry.<br/>
… Though I’m not one to speak.<br/>
"What’s wrong?" (Firo)<br/>
"Firo-san, it seems that Onii-sama does not wish to send me into battle." (Atlas)<br/>
"Hm… is Atlas-chan strong?" (Firo)<br/>
"No idea." (Atlas)<br/>
"Try Punching Firo." (Firo)<br/>
Firo tries to act as Atlas’s senior and presents herself for Atlas’s attack.<br/>
"Eh? Ah… Sure." (Atlas)<br/>
Atlas closes her fist, and hits it against Firo’s chest.<br/>
It lets out quite a nice sound.<br/>
The next moment leaves me speechless.<br/>
"AKYAAAAAAAAAA!" (Firo)<br/>
Firo does a somersault and falls flat on the ground.<br/>
"I-it’s the real deal. Atlas-chan’s punch really hurt. Master, please heal me…" (Firo)<br/>
With teary eyes, Firo stares at me.<br/>
Is she acting? That was a terrible performance.<br/>
"I just slightly disrupted the flow of the massive power within Firo… did it hurt that much?" (Atlas)<br/>
"Yeah…" (Firo)<br/>
"I’m sorry." (Atlas)<br/>
"No, I’m fine. It doesn’t hurt anymore." (Firo)<br/>
"Stop it with the jokes, monster girl! Stop trying to send my sister into battle!" (Fohl)<br/>
"Atlas-chan, punch him." (Firo)<br/>
"Ah, yes." (Atlas)<br/>
On Firo’s order Atlas smacks her fist into her brother’s chest.<br/>
Fohl makes no attempt to block, and takes the attack head on.<br/>
"KAHA…" (Fohl)<br/>
He lets out a loud sound and falls to his knees.<br/>
He seems to be tearing up.<br/>
"I-I didn’t feel… anything so… Please stay… home." (Fohl)<br/>
"You’re obviously pushing it…" (Naofumi)<br/>
This is actually quite amazing.<br/>
How did she manage to inflict damage on Fohl and Firo?<br/>
Is she able to sense something else because she can’t see?<br/>
She’s… stronger than her brother.<br/>
If she grows from here, she may turn out to be amazing. As expected of the Hakuko race.<br/>
This was an unexpected development in a good way.<br/>
The Old Woman should get to work on her immediately.<br/>
"Well, just go level in a way that doesn’t put yourself in too much danger. We’re off to go Level Reset." (Naofumi)<br/>
"Ye~s." (Atlas)<br/>
""I-I still don’t approve of you making Atlas fight. (Fohl)<br/>
"Onii-sama, no matter what you say, I want to fight. Please follow Naofumi-sama’s directions." (Atlas)<br/>
"B-but…" (Fohl)<br/>
"Firo, grab Fohl. We’re going." (Naofumi)<br/>
"Yeah!" (Firo)<br/>
Firo grabs the resisting Fohl. The other slaves prepare for the harsh trip.<br/>
"Level up the dragon chick with you. Now then, we’re off." (Naofumi)<br/>
"See you soon, Naofumi-sama." (Rafatalia)<br/>
"Yeah, I’ll be back soon." (Naofumi)<br/>
Rafatalia’s always seems to be seeing me off, but I’ve never had the opportunity of seeing her off.<br/>
But there’s no need for me to mull over it.<br/>
And so I took the slaves that wanted to level reset, and those that wanted to learn from the old man to the Castle Town.<br/>
