TLN: Hey guys, Reigokai here!<br/>
A new story is here! Yay!! :DD!<br/>
Since this is a new story, there will naturally be a lot of new keywords. If you feel like you can give out better sounding names, or see that I am using a word in the wrong way, feel free to post a comment about it!<br/>
Also, I will be translating two stories concurrently, so the denotation before the chapter name will actually be important now. For this story it will be WM for Weakest Mage.<br/>
That’s all! I hope you guys can join me in this new Isekai!!<br/>
…Okay guys, line up.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
"Is everyone okay? Wear your coats and maintain your temperature." <br/>
"Uuh…it is cold." <br/>
"I can’t take it anymore…"<br/>
"Sensei, can we really make it back?" <br/>
"Damn it, why is help not coming?!" <br/>
Our homeroom teacher, Satou-sensei, was going around talking to the students.<br/>
Everyone’s voices are fragile and dark.<br/>
How did it turn out this way?<br/>
We 1st years of the East Shinagawa senior high school were on our way back from our ski camp, but were met with heavy snow. <br/>
We were also unluckily hit by an earthquake. <br/>
The avalanche created from the earthquake dropped the bus from the cliff. <br/>
The bus was buried in the snow and it was impossible to operate it anymore.<br/>
The heating stopped, and from the openings of the broken windows, cold wind was coming in unceasingly. <br/>
More than 2 hours had already passed imprisoned inside this cell of snow.<br/>
Our teacher immediately tried to call for help with his cellphone, but there were accidents happening all over the place, and the rescue team is having a rough time.<br/>
It seems like they cannot fly a helicopter here because of the blizzard. <br/>
(Yeah, this is checkmate.)<br/>
My classmates were also spreading an aura of ‘isn’t this already hopeless?’.<br/>
No one was saying it out loud though.<br/>
Within all this…<br/>
"Takki-dono, gaming even at this kind of time?" <br/>
"I want to play games in the last moments of my life." <br/>
"You really don’t break character." <br/>
"You think?" <br/>
Without moving my gaze from the game screen, I responded to my close friend, Fuji-yan, who is at the neighboring seat.<br/>
Cold.<br/>
The cold is making it hard to move my fingers.<br/>
"Takatsuki-kun, don’t say something so grim." <br/>
The girl that sits at the opposite side of ours reprimands me.<br/>
This voice, Sasaki-san, huh.<br/>
I glanced for a bit, and she was trembling from the cold as well.<br/>
"It was a joke. It is just boring to do nothing." <br/>
"It is true that just staying in place doing nothing is rough." <br/>
Looking at my side, I see that Fuji-yan is playing a dating sim on his cellphone.<br/>
"You are also playing games, Fuji-yan." <br/>
"I am simply replaying a scene that I liked. Fufu, Kanon-chan really is the cutest." <br/>
On the screen, there’s a cat-eared girl with sparkly eyes smiling.<br/>
"Uwaa…" <br/>
Sasaki-san is letting out a ‘woow’ kind of voice.<br/>
"I understand Takki-dono, but why are you getting creeped by me too!!" <br/>
"It can’t be helped, Fuji-yan. It is a world that girls won’t understand." <br/>
"You guys, we are stranded here. Have more sense of danger." <br/>
"Don’t you actually want to play too, Sa-san?" <br/>
I know Sasaki-san is actually a hidden gamer. <br/>
That’s how we began to talk to each other.<br/>
If not, an unsocial person like me wouldn’t be talking to a girl.<br/>
"W-What are you saying?!" <br/>
"No need to hide it at this point." <br/>
"Kanon-chan, haah haah." <br/>
Fuji-yan though, you should at least show some restraint.<br/>
"You really do love cat ears as always." <br/>
"That’s not it! It is not only cat ears, but animal ears in general! They are all precious!!" <br/>
"How philosophical." <br/>
"Are you speaking nonsense already?"<br/>
Ah, Sasaki-san got angry. <br/>
Yeah, we are indeed talking nonsense. <br/>
I went back to concentrating on my game, and while I was playing and speaking, the battery had gone all the way down to ¼.<br/>
Judging from the progress of the game, I would say it will last real close to clearing.<br/>
I am currently playing an action rpg that I have been into lately.<br/>
The main character that had his homeland destroyed by a demon fights in order to exact his revenge; a dark fantasy game.<br/>
The class of the main character is hero.<br/>
When you defeat your nemesis, the doors to the world of darkness open, and the demon lord that is the string puller makes its appearance.<br/>
After defeating the giant demonic dragon, the witch that rules over death, and the fallen hero, the last dungeon appears.<br/>
The one at the lowest floor is the last boss, the demon lord.<br/>
A cutscene I have seen several hundreds of times.<br/>
I confirm my playtime.<br/>
Yeah, it is plenty enough.<br/>
The demon lord that has a lot of defense cannot be damaged with normal attacks. Because of that, there’s the need to deal counters at specific attacks. <br/>
I have repeatedly practiced the counter timings, and I can now pull them off even with my eyes closed now.<br/>
I efficiently shave off the hp gauge of the demon lord, and deal the last hit.<br/>
"Clear…" <br/>
Best record.<br/>
I would have liked to upload this to the internet.<br/>
On the screen, there’s the main character that has finished his revenge, walking towards the throne of the demon lord, and disappearing deep inside.<br/>
This time around I aimed to clear it at the shortest time possible, so it is the Normal End.<br/>
The world is at peace, but there’s no one who knows the main character that defeated the demon lord.<br/>
Saving the world, but no one celebrates him.<br/>
By the way, my favorite ending is the one where the main character becomes the demon lord.<br/>
I would have wanted to see that once more.<br/>
I looked around, and my once noisy classmates had gotten silent.<br/>
What happened?<br/>
While I was thinking that, sudden sleepiness struck me.<br/>
I speak to Fuji-yan at my side.<br/>
"Fuji-yan?" <br/>
There’s no response. It is just a corpse.<br/>
Seriously…?<br/>
Sasaki-san on the other side has her head down and I can’t see her face. <br/>
She is completely limp.<br/>
"Sa-san? Sasaki-san?" <br/>
No response either.<br/>
The game screen ran out of battery in the middle of the ending.<br/>
(…So sleepy.)<br/>
My lifespan is on the verge of running out too.<br/>
…Haah, it was a short life.<br/>
If I get reborn, please make me into a hero.<br/>
While thinking about such nonsense, I close my eyes and my consciousness grows further away.<br/>
◇◇<br/>
 I woke up.<br/>
"Where’s this?" <br/>
I look around, but this isn’t the inside of the bus.<br/>
"Isn’t a hospital either…" <br/>
It isn’t concrete, but a stone ceiling and walls. Is it marble?<br/>
I was sleeping on a hard and simple bed, with a thin blanket on top of me. <br/>
The window seems to be open, I can feel the wind entering.<br/>
It is a bit cold.<br/>
I don’t know if this is the cold of the afterlife, but I am probably still alive.<br/>
There’s a big window a bit further away.<br/>
It is bright outside.<br/>
(It is already noon, huh.) <br/>
It was night on our way back from the camp, so that means I have been sleeping for more than half a day. <br/>
"At any rate, how can they leave alone an injured person that they rescued from a snowy mountain?" <br/>
I complain alone.<br/>
I should check the outside.<br/>
I swayed my way to the window.<br/>
My head was still hazy. <br/>
Someone must have rescued me, is what I thought.<br/>
I was feeling grim thinking that they left me sleeping in a weird place.<br/>
I stand at the window and look outside.<br/>
"Eh?" <br/>
The sight spreading before me is…not Tokyo, but a deep forest.<br/>
A vast blue lake.<br/>
At the back of it, a mountain range like that of the Alps.<br/>
On top of the lake, there’s a bird of 7 color wings flying leisurely. <br/>
At the lakeshore there’s a dinosaur-looking creature drinking water.<br/>
There’s several carriages parked in front of this building.<br/>
The ones operating the carriages have lizard heads or even dog-like faces.<br/>
"…Beastkin?" <br/>
Wa…What is that?<br/>
What’s pulling the carriages are birds bigger than ostriches.<br/>
There’s also giant lizard-looking things.<br/>
"A hollywood movie?" <br/>
My voice was trembling.<br/>
"Shoot!!" <br/>
"""[Fire Arrow]!!"""<br/>
When I look below the window, there’s children forming a row in what seems to be a track field. <br/>
They are wearing robes, and all of them shot arrows of fire at the same time.<br/>
The fire arrows hit the targets and exploded.<br/>
The cinders of the explosion and the smoke reached my nose.<br/>
The smell of burned wood returns me to my senses.<br/>
This is not a dream?<br/>
"Aah…" <br/>
Is this that?<br/>
What I have seen in movies and anime? <br/>
…An Isekai.<br/>
