Arifureta After III   Shia Arc   The Ruin of Curse<br/>
<br/>
Large splashes danced on the broad river with the cloudy, light-brown water. Waves were spreading as though the river was being cut up from something heading upstream.<br/>
The cause of this was a black coated boat――Triana. Taking in water and then jetting it out, the chain of process was moving with magic power through a jet propulsion mechanism, so the driving force was shockingly silent when compared with to normal engines that used propeller mechanisms.<br/>
「Nn~, it feels good desuu~」<br/>
Rabbit ears were energetically flapping about *patapatapatapata-*. Shia’s whole body was being showered by the wind while she narrowed her eyes pleasantly.<br/>
The speed that couldn’t be obtained from the local old boats seemed to grant the rider with pleasant wind. Even Hajime, who was similarly basking in the wind while holding the wheel, nodded 「You’re right」 in a good mood.<br/>
「Hajime-san, Hajime-san, I also want to drive.」<br/>
「……Just sit obediently there.」<br/>
Shia was making her request with eyes that were sparkling with hope, but sadly Hajime, whose eyes twitched for an instant, rejected it. Shia’s cheeks puffed up roundly. It was easy to guess that she was stating 「I’m dissatisfied desu!」 with that expression.<br/>
「I want to drive desuu!」<br/>
「Are you a spoiled brat? Even though you puffed your cheeks like that, if I say no, then no.」<br/>
「Why!? Just what kind of problem is there with me driving!?」<br/>
「Dangerous driving.」<br/>
‘Heh?’ Shia tilted her head in puzzlement. Her expression looked as though she had just heard an unknown word. It seemed that at the very least she was believing, without a doubt, that it was a word that was completely unrelated and inapplicable to her.<br/>
「Now see here……」<br/>
「Wha, what’s with that exasperated face?」<br/>
「I’ll tell you then if you don’t have an awareness of it……Sometimes there are people who will completely change when they are holding the wheel, right? You are exactly that kind of person. Currently, Schutaif feels like it’s mostly for Shia’s exclusive use, but…..」<br/>
「That’s right, if it’s a vehicle running with magic power, I’m already riding Schutaif around regularly, so there is no problem at all!」<br/>
「Try saying how many times you have been chased by the police.」<br/>
「……」<br/>
Shia stared at the sky. Aa, today too the sky is really clear. For the sky to be this blue……<br/>
「Oi, what’s the matter rampaging rabbit. I’m telling you to say how many times you’ve been playing tag with a few dozen patrol cars.」<br/>
「……I don’t really understand, what is it about I wonder――」<br/>
「Far from obeying the word "STOO~PP!" of the police, you were yelling "If you can catch me then try to damn catch me desuu!" while driving recklessly. You were putting out speeds more than 200 km/hour even though you were on a public highway and won the race by a wide margin. Now try saying who that person could possibly be.」<br/>
「……」<br/>
Shia’s rabbit ears were limply flopping as though to say "the rabbit ears feel painful".<br/>
However, the reproachful eyes of Hajime-san didn’t stop from dealing an additional blow. He divulged every evil committed by the rabbit who would rampage when she held the wheel!<br/>
「How many times have you won against the bunch that look like delinquents or biker gang while mocking them "S-LO~OW! DESUU!"? Who is the one who secretly got called "the mysterious rampaging anegobig sis"?」<br/>
「……Tha, that’s a person who accidentally resembles me, you know? It’s a different person.」<br/>
「You know, just in case, the Schutaif has the recognition obstruction function for its rider, and its number will automatically get rewritten periodically. The police must be unable to identify the criminal.」<br/>
By the way, among the police, this person was known as "the rampaging girl with a screw loose". The high-speed riot squad carried out improvements on their cars in order to oppose Shia while the squad members were levied with demonic training in order to raise their driving skills. Finally, even the sortie of helicopters became a common thing, but because the criminal’s identity was still unknown they were all holding their heads in frustration……<br/>
「Tha, that’s right. The criminal’s identity is still unknown. In other words, it’s not me! Oh dear, in this world there are those kinds of outrageous people, isn’t it!」<br/>
Actually, Shia got more into the hobby of driving rather than her hobby of martial arts. She was enjoying rampaging during holidays or late at night. What was troubling was that rather than driving in a vast plain like on Tortus, she preferred to drive on maintained roads like those of the urban areas of Earth.<br/>
Perhaps she had self-awareness as a bad rabbit who was averting her eyes from the Road Traffic Act at full power while merely pursuing speed. It seemed she was intending to keep her hobby of driving recklessly a secret from her family in her own way, but……<br/>
Everything was seen through already. Hajime’s gaze stabbed at her with that meaning.<br/>
*Jii~~-*. *Jirijiri~~~-*.<br/>
「Uu……」<br/>
「You think the mass media didn’t sniff it out after you rampaged that much?」<br/>
A girl of unknown identity who, although she didn’t steal anything, was running around at night on a bike. No matter how much effort was spent to capture her, she would escape. And mysteriously, it was mysterious how that girl left no impression at all except that she was a "young girl".<br/>
It wasn’t a complete removal of memory, so there was no way the mass media wouldn’t bite at it.<br/>
「Bu, but, there isn’t anything on the news or anything……」<br/>
「Because I dealt with it.」<br/>
「Guuu」<br/>
She let out a ‘guu’ sound. Shia’s gaze kept swimming around a lot. (TN: In Japan, there is a phrase of ‘cannot even make a guu sound’, which means someone is so speechless that they cannot say anything back.)<br/>
Hajime-san was making a reproachful stare on the level of Yue while dealing the final blow.<br/>
「Before this, Myuu made a mess by having a dog fight with the ASDFAir Self-Defense Force using a toy aircraft.」<br/>
「!」<br/>
「When I asked her why she did that, "It’s unfair that only Shia-oneechan had fun nano! Even though Myuu cannot ride both Schutaif or Brieze! That’s why Myuu played with the JSDF officer using Tomcat-tan! Just like Shia-neechan! Just like Shia-neechan!" she said――」<br/>
「I’m really deeply sorryyy! I’m the criminal desuu!」<br/>
Shia did a dogeza posture on the deck of Triana’s bow. On her butt, her rabbit tail was flapping *patapatapata-* from the wind.<br/>
Hajime sighed and patted Shia’s head fluffily while saying.<br/>
「Because of that reason, not letting Shia holding the wheel while there are other people riding together was the decided method of the Nagumo family emergency family meeting that was held while you were in the middle of rampaging.」<br/>
「Tha, that kind of decision was made while I was becoming wind……」<br/>
Shia’s expression was becoming lost for words while she was sitting meekly on her seat this time. Thinking that she finally accepted it, Hajime shrugged his shoulders and returned his concentration to driving.<br/>
For a while, while enjoying the wind and the sound of water, Shia suddenly titled her head saying 「Eh?」.<br/>
「If everyone knows, why didn’t anyone stop me?」<br/>
Shia didn’t know the chronology, but from what Hajime had said before, it felt like Shia’s driving hobby was already known from the start.<br/>
Then even though it would be fine if he just stopped her normally, why instead was he not saying anything and even went as far as quieting the mass media……<br/>
Thinking about it, just now Hajime said to her 「he is riding together with her so he cannot leave the driving to her」, but he didn’t tell her to stop her habitual reckless driving.<br/>
Hajime’s answer toward that question was,<br/>
「You like it, right? Running around on the bike?」<br/>
「……」<br/>
In other words, it was like that.<br/>
He didn’t stop her because it was something that Shia liked. Rather, he did all in his power so that Shia could have fun.<br/>
The recognition obstruction function that was installed on Schutaif was also a part of it. With Shia’s reflexes, driving technique, and Schutaif’s excellent operability that was working together with the direct operation of magic power, surely there wouldn’t be any incidents even in the slightest chance. However, twofold and threefold safety measures were still prepared ahead of time that covered even the risk of indirect incidents. The countermeasure against the mass media was naturally also being done.<br/>
Shia’s expression turned into a look as though she had stuffed her cheeks full with delicious sweets that were extraordinarily sweet.<br/>
And then, she quietly stood up and wordlessly embraced Hajime’s back. She circled her hands around him from behind and hugged tightly. She put her chin on Hajime’s shoulder and rubbed her cheek on his face.<br/>
「Oi oi, it’s getting hard to drive.」<br/>
「You can directly steer using magic power operation righttt~」<br/>
Her melting voice sounded as sweet as her expression. Hajime chuckled slightly and fluffed Shia’s head from across his shoulder.<br/>
The travel date of just the two of them……the air became sweet anytime there was an opening.<br/>
If they were looked at from the side, it wasn’t any inferior with Hajime & Yue during their Tortus period. If the classmates were here, surely everyone would harmoniously get the malady of vomiting out sugar.<br/>
But, at that time, some kind of large object from upstream was flowing near with strong momentum. Shia, who noticed that while still embracing Hajime from behind, raised her voice「Ah」.<br/>
「Hajime-san, a large piece of driftwood is――」<br/>
‘Right there. It’s dangerous.’ The moment she was going to say that,<br/>
*Uin! Gakon-! Pashu! Chudon-!!!*<br/>
「Hm? What did you say?」<br/>
The large piece of wood that was flowing in a direct course to block the river became the prey of the pencil missiles!<br/>
Triana went right through on the river that was colored by flame blasts and water pillars as though nothing had happened. A barrier that let wind past but deflected rain was blocking the pouring down water. However, the heat wave was caressing Shia’s cheek.<br/>
Perhaps because of the surprise from the explosion that suddenly occurred, a crocodile poked its head out from the river! It tried to run away to the river bank in a panic! A lot of birds were flying up from the opposite bank!<br/>
The gatling reacted!<br/>
*Uin! Gakon-! Stand b~~~~y!*<br/>
「WAAAAAAAAAH, CROCODILE-SAN WATCH OO~~~UT DESU!」<br/>
Shia leapt at the gatling on the starboard and directed the muzzle up forcefully. At the same time, she took out a metal ball from the treasure warehouse and used only her foot to kick it flying, directing the muzzle of the gatling on the ship’s port to a different direction too.<br/>
A rain of bullets flew out above and to the rear. Shia didn’t make it in time slightly, and several shots attacked the crocodile-san and all the bird-sans.<br/>
A bullet grazed *chuin!* the crocodile-san and it desperately escaped in a state that it felt like「NOOOOOOO-, CROCODILE KILLERRRR!」 such a scream could be heard. While all the bird-sans, with an act that might be from their instincts, dispersed with movements so splendid that it felt like「BREAK! BREAK UP!」 could be heard. In addition, they succeeded in a super dodge from the bullets’ trajectory using beautiful barrel rolls.<br/>
Shia spoke while grabbing hard to Hajime’s shoulders.<br/>
「Hajime-san, please switch places with me.」<br/>
「Why? Just what kind of problem is there with me driving?」<br/>
「Dangerous driving.」<br/>
‘Heh?’ Hajime tilted his head in puzzlement. His expression looked as though he had just heard an unknown word. It seemed that at the very least he was believing without a doubt that it was a word that was completely unrelated and inapplicable with him.<br/>
Although the vector was different, Hajime too was a habitual offender of dangerous driving.<br/>
That’s dangerous driving just now! Nagumo family, assemble! An emergency family meeting is needed desu!<br/>
After that, they were advancing for around an hour while there was a scramble for the wheel on the ship.<br/>
Hajime and Shia finally arrived at the riverside that was near the rumored ruins that were their destination. From here onward they would walk.<br/>
「Huff, huff, Hajime-san, you blockhead! In the end, you didn’t let me hold the wheel even once!」<br/>
「Haa, haa, na, naturally. Shia’s driving is dangerous after all.」<br/>
Both of them mutually deployed fierce offenses and defenses with Triana’s steering wheel in the center which caused their breathing to rise somewhat. They got down on the bank. Shia was looking at Hajime storing Triana into the treasure warehouse while discharging an objection with her rabbit ears looking disheveled.<br/>
「It’s Hajime-san who’s driving dangerously with high killing power!」<br/>
「Where. Removing dangerous animals or driftwood that we won’t get away unscathed if we collided with are rather acts that remove the danger.」<br/>
「Does Hajime-san have the awareness that you are the most dangerous organism on Earth? Or rather, just what is dangerous from the bird-sans; try saying it.」<br/>
「……About the bird-sans, honestly, it’s not like I do not think that I didn’t do anything bad. I’ll improve the gatling’s movement sensor later.」<br/>
That wasn’t it. On Earth, where it wasn’t like there are any monsters, having a gatling――or rather, something that was functionally a sentry gun――being installed on a boat was itself dangerous.<br/>
「……That thing was attacking automatically. At least please make it something that is operated manually.」<br/>
「Removing Sentori-sensei, you said? How dare you say such a rude thing.」 (TN: In Japan, sentry is read as sentori. Also, the sentori here is written with the kanji of thousandsen, and birdtori, which is the sentry gun’s nickname in Japan.)<br/>
Hajime, who was running on romance, couldn’t be stopped by anyone unless it was Yue’s ‘chuu chuu’ or Shia’s backdrop.<br/>
Shia let out a sigh, then muttered 「This matter while be put on hold. It’s family meeting time when we go home desuu」. For the time being, she overlooked Hajime’s troubling hobby. After all, he also overlooked her hobby.<br/>
Both of them pulled themselves together and stepped inside the thick forest that was growing densely.<br/>
They walked through the trackless path. They were cutting down leaves and branches rapidly using large hatchets. They decided the direction where they should be heading using the hand-written map and compass that they received from the village. They weren’t using the Compass or satellite pictures.<br/>
It was an inconvenient and greatly troublesome method, but Shia, who was waving around a hatchet and cutting open the path in front, looked like she was really having fun. Her rabbit ears were moving rhythmically from her agile movements of avoiding the jutting out branches.<br/>
Just when he thought that she liked running through the city, she also liked to go through a pathless forest. In the end, Shia could have fun with anything, and in fact, she had fun with everything. It was the way of this gloriously simple rabbit.<br/>
「This place is really not bad at all, isn’t it? The river is nearby, and from this presence, it feels like there are a lot of living things here. Plants that look edible are also abundant.」<br/>
Hajime reflexively laughed hearing that way of talking that sounded like a person searching for an apartment room confirming the site condition. Certainly, they were coming to search for a new base, so making such comments weren’t mistaken, but……her migration requirement that sounded like she was saying that the drug store was near, and there was also a convenience store nearby, was actually really wild.<br/>
「Even though people frequently pass through here, right now there are no signs of that at all. It’s just like the people in the village said, this must be a place that usually no one will go near. It’s not bad for Kam and the others.」<br/>
「Looking at the map, as long as they don’t cross the river using a boat, it will be necessary to take quite a far detour.」<br/>
In the middle of talking, Shia hopped. When Hajime looked below her with a questioning gaze, several small flowers were seen blooming there. Hajime also avoided them so as to not step on them.<br/>
「Hajime-san. Are we going the right way?」<br/>
「Hm? Aa, it’s fine. It’s straight ahead of here.」<br/>
「Roger desuu.」<br/>
The hatchet’s movement stopped still suddenly, and then Shia shifted the position slightly and cut through the branches in a single stroke. She advanced forward once more. After looking closer, the branches that she was going to cut first had a spider web laid out on them, and a large spider was clinging quietly on it. For the moment Hajime too went through while avoiding the spider web so as not to destroy it.<br/>
「Oops, it’s dangerous you know~」<br/>
「?」<br/>
Shia swung her hatchet again. However, it was obvious from a glance that it wasn’t to cut an obstacle. She turned the hatchet so that its flat surface was facing the direction of her swing. She swung it downward slowly in a scooping way, catching a snake that was rearing its head, and gently threw it into the brush.<br/>
「You really are a Hauria huh.」<br/>
「What are you saying?」<br/>
‘No, nothing’, Hajime shook his head with a wry smile.<br/>
Kam and others who were fussing about insects. The young boy Par who loved flowers.<br/>
Everything was the story of a distant past. If it was the current them, by the point in time a snake reared its head, it would surely be killed in a snap. With fiercely glinting eyes and a fearless smile tugged on their lips.<br/>
It was only Shia who was carrying a fragment of the "gentle forest bunny-sanHauria clan" that had become a phantasmal species now. It could be said that she was a rare rabbit in another sense.<br/>
The one who caused that was Hajime himself, but he put that fact aside and stared warmly at the back of Shia’s figure who continued to advance while paying attention to the forest’s fauna and flora.<br/>
Like that, the two advanced deeper and deeper into the dense forest, but after walking for nearly two hours, regardless of how, it wouldn’t be strange if the ruins came into view at any moment. However, at this point in time, not even a hint or shadow of the ruins could be found, so Hajime finally started whining.<br/>
「Say, Shia. Compass……」<br/>
「No.」<br/>
「Just a little bit……」<br/>
「Geez-. Hajime-san, you modern youngster! You are poisoned too much by the convenient tools! You cannot escape to the easy path just because of a bit of difficulty!」<br/>
「Shia-mama, please. I’m begging you. I’m already tired here, mentally.」<br/>
「Who are you calling mama? Surely, it’s just a little bit more. Let’s work hard without giving up until the end.」<br/>
Hajime said jokingly because Shia’s speech sounded like a mom, but it appeared that Shia-mama was the ally of a kid who did his best until the end.<br/>
The sun would set in just a few more hours, so he only tried saying that for a bit, Hajime thought with a wry smile. He lifted both his hands to show his surrender.<br/>
「Nn~, but certainly, I want to pinpoint the place by today at least. ……Yosh, let’s try looking around a bit from above.」<br/>
She was trying to climb a tree and to find the location of the ruins from above the dense forest.<br/>
While Hajime was watching, Shia was……*gugu-* bending her knee. In the next instant, *don-* an impact sound came the same time Shia vanished. No, more precisely she jumped with so much force that it caused her to seem to vanish.<br/>
「That’s like the main character of Mat○ix, huh. However, it’s in real life though.」<br/>
You are jumping into the sky with a force that caused the ground to undulate. The messiah-sama of a certain movie would fly to the beyond without pause like that, but Shia only came out to the sky above the forest before returning right away.<br/>
She landed softly in a way that felt weightless. Most likely, she was decreasing her weight using gravity magic.<br/>
Certainly, it was a searching method that was only using her own strength without any convenient tool at all. Hajime couldn’t fully accept it though.<br/>
「H~m. I cannot really see anything that looks like a building. Are we lost?」<br/>
「If the ruins are really at this position on the map, then we shouldn’t be going in the wrong direction. And it’s not like our sense of direction has led us astray like in the sea of trees. The compass is also functioning normally.」<br/>
「In that case, there is a problem with the distance then. That villager too, "If I remember right, it’s around here I think", said it a bit vaguely like that.」<br/>
Shia groaned ‘mumumu’. For the time being, the two would keep advancing like this. However, they were doing that while Shia frequently leapt with a great jump above the dense forest to check the surroundings.<br/>
A rabbit was hopping *pyon pyon* in a dense forest…….<br/>
However, it was a consecutive jump of close to thirty meters.<br/>
Even though the convenient tools were sealed, as expected, Hajime felt like he couldn’t fully accept this.<br/>
Although, it seemed that the method was effective. Not even fifteen minutes after that, Shia raised her voice 「Aaa!」<br/>
「Discovery! Hajime-san, I discovered iit!」(TN: Not a typo, this is the character speaking with a prolonged word. If you found anything like this before then most likely, it’s also not a typo. But when I reread it, it feels like a strange way of writing. Can anyone teach me if there is a correct way to write something like this?)<br/>
「Oo~, finally. It’s worth it going pyon pyon like that huh.」<br/>
According to Shia, the leaves and branches acted as an obstruction so that she couldn’t see from above, but when she looked at it diagonally from an angle of 45 degrees, there was an opening between the leaves and branches that was just right for her to be able to see a building. In other words, it was difficult to discover the place using things like satellite pictures.<br/>
Both of them were heading toward the ruins with footsteps that felt somewhat excited.<br/>
As they got closer to the ruins, the trees became thick, and the density of the plants increased. It was as though nature itself was blocking any invasion.<br/>
Shia was cutting apart those plants with a hatchet. The sword pressure, no, the hatchet pressure’s shockwave blew away the obstructions while they advanced, and then finally that figure appeared.<br/>
「Oo. Indeed, they’re ruins that make us feel its many years of history.」<br/>
「The vegetation is dense, so that might be why the area around here is gloomy. It feels a bit eerie. I feel like I can understand why the villagers fear it.」<br/>
Inside the dense, gloomy forest, some building made from stone was standing quietly. Stones with sizes even bigger than human adults, which were unknown from where and how they were brought here, were piled up to form a structure. The cut sections were surprisingly smooth, giving the impression that the stones were sticking together perfectly.<br/>
Although weeds and roots were sticking out from between the stones, the whole building was covered with vines; and the stones themselves also appeared cracked and weathered.<br/>
A fully-grown tree broke through the building. It could clearly be seen how the passage of time affected even the stones.<br/>
The construction itself was extremely simple. The size was similar to a largish residence that could be found in the countryside. It didn’t have two floors and was only a one-story building. There was no door. A wide gaping hole was filled with a spreading darkness that looked inviting.<br/>
After Hajime and Shia exchanged gazes, they nodded once to each other and stepped inside.<br/>
……Fifteen minutes later.<br/>
「There really is nothing at all!」<br/>
「Please give me back my thrill desuu!」<br/>
Inside the ruins, Hajime and Shia’s tsukkomi echoed.<br/>
In fact, the inside was so empty that it made them want to make tsukkomi about just what was with the atmosphere of the ruins that made it appear as if there would really be something.<br/>
「Well, this is after an investigation has been done here. Even if there was something here, it’s obviously had been taken away. But still, it should be a bit more, like……right?」<br/>
「I understand what Hajime-san wants to say. Something that can make us imagine the livelihood of the people in the past or something like a painting on the wall that will make the brain ponder "Mu? What is this picture expressing?", or like the trace of relief, something like those!」<br/>
「Yep yep, something like those!」<br/>
A beat later.<br/>
「Good grief, what a total let down.」<br/>
「Good grief, what a total let down desuu.」<br/>
Hajime and Shia’s shoulders dropped with their voices matching each other.<br/>
Surely, if the ruins had its own will, it would surely object「No, even if you told me that. Or rather, who the hell are you guys」 without a doubt.<br/>
Well, this was Earth, so there was no way there would be that many unexplored regions that were filled with mysteries and puzzles like in Tortus. Both of them quickly left the ruins.<br/>
「It will be one more hour until the sun sets, I guess? What to do Shia. We finally found a building, so I think it’s fine to stay here today.」<br/>
「You’re right. But if we still have an hour, we can explore the surrounding quite a lot you know? From the start, our objective was to search further back from the ruins. While the ruins are only a replacement boundary to repel people, how about going to take a look for a little bit?」<br/>
「Well, if it’s just searching the surrounding, starting now isn’t too bad……」<br/>
Hajime made a little wry smile at Shia who was really active. And then, he followed behind Shia who was energetically stepping deeper into the forest behind the ruins.<br/>
Before long the sun had completely set. Hajime and Shia doubled back to the ruins with hurried steps while thinking that they had spent a bit too much time on the search.<br/>
Suddenly, Shia’s rabbit ears twitched around in reaction.<br/>
「Eh?」<br/>
「What’s up Shia?」<br/>
「Uu~n. There are people. At where the ruins are.」<br/>
「At this kind of time? I wonder if it’s the local people coming for a test of courage?」<br/>
It was just an inch from complete darkness if there was no light. The moonlight also didn’t reach inside this dense forest. That was about the only possibility that Hajime thought was possible.<br/>
But, that prediction of Hajime’s was immediately proven wrong.<br/>
「No, I think that’s not it. It feels like there is totally a lot.」<br/>
「Is it a large number of people? About how many?」<br/>
「I don’t know clearly, but……thirty? No, it’s more than forty.」<br/>
「That’s a lot! Seriously!」<br/>
As expected, even Hajime’s eyes opened wide in surprise.<br/>
「What do we do, Hajime-san?」<br/>
「In any case, we won’t understand the situation from here. Besides, I’m also curious as to why a lot of people are visiting those empty ruins at this kind of time. Let’s approach without being found out by those guys and confirm what they are doing.」<br/>
Shia nodded at Hajime’s suggestion, and the two approached the ruins while erasing their presences.<br/>
The closer they got, even Hajime became able to sense the presence of a lot of people. In addition, when they came up to a few dozen meters away from the ruins, they understood from in between the gaps of the branches and leaves that the area around the ruins was brightly illuminated as though it was afternoon.<br/>
Hajime and Shia looked at each other’s faces, and without pause, they soundlessly leapt on a thick tree branch where they could look over the whole ruins.<br/>
「Oi oi, seriously? Where did this investigation team come from?」<br/>
「After this long? When it’s already been investigated?」<br/>
Ahead of their gaze, there were several large tents set up in front of the ruins. A great number of large lightings illuminated the surroundings. Furthermore, equipment of unknown function was set up here and there.<br/>
「I don’t really know the details, but everything looks to be of nice quality. They obviously aren’t from around here.」<br/>
「Foreigners……perhaps, they are from the USA. There are a lot of them. The Americans number around twenty people, and the locals……perhaps around thirty, including the presence inside the building?」<br/>
「Seems so. ……Oi, Shia. Can you see the logo on those tents and machinery?」<br/>
「Ee~rr, yes yes, I can see it you know? It’s a picture of an arrow stabbing a treasure box with an opened lid?」<br/>
「Aah. That huh. I remember seeing it somewhere.」<br/>
Most likely it was a logo of a company that manufactured or possessed machinery and so on. Hajime seemed to know about the logo. Shia asked him 「Where did you see it?」.<br/>
Hajime’s expression was really complicated while saying 「Was that a flag, god damn it」, he then opened his mouth to answer.<br/>
「At the restaurant in Puhang.」<br/>
「That’s, could it be……」<br/>
Yes, Hajime saw the logo when the guy who seemed to be the bodyguard of that "sham actor" took off his jacket. There was the same logo on the inner part of that jacket.<br/>
As expected, from the tent that was conspicuously larger than the others, a familiar man came out while fiddling with a tablet.<br/>
「Look, that guy. It’s Will Turner.」<br/>
「That’s not it. It’s Helmut-san.」<br/>
It was Wilford-san.<br/>
By no means was that person the quasi-main character of a certain pirate movie or an evil dragon of a sky world.<br/>
That Wilford watched the table while thinking about something. Sometimes he gave out instructions to the local people.<br/>
The figure of that "highly strung" Brandon could be seen. He was giving out instructions to his fellow Americans that looked like researchers, who seemed to be his underlings.<br/>
There were also muscular men around a bit of a distance away from the tents and ruins. Although, from where the two were standing, they couldn’t see anything that looked exactly like a gun, the men were running their sharp gazes around the surrounding forest.<br/>
「Those guys, so this is their destination.」<br/>
「As expected, it was a flag, wasn’t it? As expected of Hajime-san.」<br/>
「You’re noisy. At any rate, this bunch, just what in the world are they doing at these empty ruins that have been investigated――」<br/>
‘Already’, the word that Hajime was going to say was stopped midway.<br/>
「aAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA!!」<br/>
A scream that sounded like the yell of a death throe resounded from inside the ruin.<br/>
The place suddenly became noisy.<br/>
A local man rushed out from inside the ruins.<br/>
He screamed while rolling around on the ground, and before long he stopped moving. The hand pressing on his face lost strength and fell limply to the ground.<br/>
The face of the expired man was melting tragically.<br/>
<br/>
AN: Thank you very much for reading this every time.<br/>
Thank you very much too for the thoughts, opinions, and reports about misspelling and omitted words.<br/>
I had fun writing the conversation with Shia.<br/>
As a result, the story didn’t progress.<br/>
It looks like my "serious" power was used up during the Kouki-arc. Please bear with me until I recover.<br/>
