<br/>
The fact that I’m releasing things at a faster rate means that there are other important things that I have to do, and that I’m procrastinating.<br/>
Chapter 246: Revolution<br/>
"And like that, Itsuki’s out of the picture. Just in case, we should check out the castle town too." (Naofumi)<br/>
"Firo is sleepy." (Firo)<br/>
"Kyuaa…" (Gaelion)<br/>
The monsters yawn drowsily.<br/>
"It’s definitely late, but this is the time where we should be working hard!" (Atlas)<br/>
Though Atlas gave such a declaration, Firo and the others continuously relay their fatigue.<br/>
They’ve been constantly fighting for a while, and it’s long past bed time.<br/>
"Don’t worry about it. Everyone gather here." (Naofumi)<br/>
Let’s see. I think the maximum for the Portal Shield was 7 people… but if I think about it, Ren has his Transfer Sword as well, so we can move even more.<br/>
It may be best to check the castle before returning home…<br/>
"Ren, can you teleport to the castle town?" (Naofumi)<br/>
"No." (Ren)<br/>
Well, he is supposed to be under house arrest at my place. It’s only recently that I gave him the right to move around freely.<br/>
And the only ones who can undo the brainwashing are me and Rishia. What should we do?<br/>
"We also need someone to look over Itsuki. Rishia, you’re one of the keys to resolving this incident, so I have to put you to work." (Naofumi)<br/>
"Fue…" (Rishia)<br/>
"Just think of it as for Itsuki’s sake." (Naofumi)<br/>
"I know." (Rishia)<br/>
"Now then, for now… Let’s go to the Castle Town. Witch is probably there." (Naofumi)<br/>
"Naofumi, want me to look after Itsuki?" (Ren) (TL: THE SHIP HAS SAILED)<br/>
Ren volunteers for the job.<br/>
I guess that’s not a bad idea.<br/>
The Castle Town has Motoyasu, so they should be okay to some extent.<br/>
Instead of keeping all of the Heroes in one place, it’s probably best for me to leave one here.<br/>
That means, including me, I need seven, so… Me, Atlas, Firo, Rishia, Gaelion, and Taniko?<br/>
The Filo Rials we used to get here should stay to help hold down Itsuki when he gets up.<br/>
They haven’t class-upped yet, so their levels are stuck in the 30s though.<br/>
It’s best not to move him around too much… But taking him with us seems dangerous.<br/>
I want to leave some people who can block teleportation with him as well.<br/>
"Then Ren, Gaelion, and Taniko will be turning Itsuki in with the Three Hero Church remnants." (Naofumi)<br/>
"Got it." (Ren)<br/>
"KYUA!" (Gaelion)<br/>
"We just have to take these people to the village, right?" (Taniko)<br/>
"Yeah. Ren has a transfer skill, so you should be fine. Now the people left are…" (Naofumi)<br/>
The Filo Rials’ eyes are shining. They’re signaling for me to choose them.<br/>
It’s good that they’re motivated, but don’t stare at me like that.<br/>
"You all…" (Naofumi)<br/>
"KUE!" (Filo Rials)<br/>
They cry out happily.<br/>
For the love of…<br/>
"I guess it should work out fine." (Naofumi)<br/>
"Yeah…" (Ren)<br/>
And like that, Ren and I divide into two groups and activate our transfer skills.<br/>
The point I teleport to in Melromark’s Castle Town is the same one I always use.<br/>
The space I set is inside of the Castle, so that works out perfectly.<br/>
But as always, this spot reeks of dust.<br/>
I peer out of the door from the room I appeared in and check the situation.<br/>
I hear the sound of multiple footsteps scampering all around the place.<br/>
"Bring down the Evil Queen who discriminates against her own people!"<br/>
Words like that echo through the hallways.<br/>
So they are here as well.<br/>
"Atlas and Rishia, can you feel anything?" (Naofumi)<br/>
I let Rishia look outside.<br/>
"Yes, there is some negative aura coming from that direction." (Rishia)<br/>
"Right." (Atlas)<br/>
Yeah, as I thought.<br/>
"Ah, right, Naofumi-sama?" (Atlas)<br/>
"What is it?" (Naofumi)<br/>
"The nature of the dark Chi seems to have changed." (Atlas)<br/>
"Changed? What do you mean?" (Naofumi)<br/>
"How should I put this? Since Rishia defeated that person, it seems to be losing a sense of order." (Atlas)<br/>
"I see." (Naofumi)<br/>
I think Itsuki called it the Justice Bow or something.<br/>
That bow had some sort of controlling effect.<br/>
I don’t really know what changed. We’ll have to find out through battle.<br/>
"Alright, Rishia. You go around dispelling brainwashing with that weapon." (Naofumi)<br/>
"Okay." (Rishia)<br/>
As I issued those orders, I throw open the door and run out.<br/>
"W-who are you!?"<br/>
A group of eight soldiers with strange eyes turn towards us and get into battle formation.<br/>
"Tei!" (Rishia)<br/>
But before they can do anything, Rishia throws her chakram, and they circle each soldier individually.<br/>
Long range projectiles sure are nice.<br/>
I can only take attacks and counter to some extent.<br/>
My weapon is supposed to be a defensive armament. It has a good affinity with long range magic and weapons.<br/>
"Gaha…" (Soldiers)<br/>
As if they were marionettes who had had their strings cut, the soldiers all fall to the ground. But they get up soon after.<br/>
"What? Where… is this?" (Soldier)<br/>
"Are you up yet?" (Naofumi)<br/>
"The Hero of the Shield…" (Soldier)<br/>
"Are you guys part of the Three Hero Church?" (Naofumi)<br/>
"N-no… but for you to be an ally is… a bit…" (Soldier)<br/>
There are still quite a few soldiers who hate me.<br/>
But, work being work, they do follow the Queen’s orders without complaint. That doesn’t change their opinion of me, though.<br/>
But, it’s not something I have to worry about. I don’t really care what they think.<br/>
The soldiers are avoiding eye contact as they speak.<br/>
"Did something happen? What’s the situation?" (Naofumi)<br/>
"My consciousness was vague…" (Soldier)<br/>
"Just tell me what you know. Speak already." (Naofumi)<br/>
"Yes." (Soldier)<br/>
The soldiers’ story went as such.<br/>
This evening, various groups rose up and started a revolution.<br/>
They called for the death of the Discriminatory Queen.<br/>
The soldiers rushed out to suppress this rebellion.<br/>
But after a while, the soldiers that were supposed to suppress the enemy forces ended up joining them, and the situation got out of hand.<br/>
And, by the time the sun had set, the rebellious faction succeeded in occupying part of the city, and various nobles began supporting them.<br/>
That’s around the time we began our plan.<br/>
The representative of the Rebellious Faction was Witch.<br/>
Quite a few people had anticipated that the nobles would rise up in protest at some point. A few people even tried to instigate them to get rid of those nobles. But they never thought it would escalate to this level.<br/>
I can’t really say anything here.<br/>
Well, you know… If I had the ability to predict that they would invent a weapon with brainwashing powers to try and usurp the country’s royalty, I would be a prophet by now.<br/>
They do have the Shadow information system, but I guess they never managed to dig as far as the rebels’ scientific research projects.<br/>
I didn’t expect those at all until I encountered them myself.<br/>
And, unless a random passerby casually took a stab at you, you wouldn’t realize they were brainwashed.<br/>
And, more than anything else, the existence of a weapon with such abilities would usually be denied by the general public.<br/>
Even if it were to be reported, there’s a high chance the report would not be taken seriously.<br/>
But that doesn’t matter for now. I can ask all the questions I want later.<br/>
The Shadows work as this country’s secret spy service, but it’s not good to rely on them too much.<br/>
Their numbers seem to have dropped during the Spirit Turtle incident, so there’s no helping it.<br/>
And, if I think about it, there are some shadows in the Three Hero Church as well.<br/>
Could members like that still be running rampant in their ranks?<br/>
They’re not just limited to working in this country, so they’re definitely short on personnel.<br/>
(TL: Apply to be a Shadow now)<br/>
… Since the start of this incident, I haven’t seen a single one. They may be doing something important.<br/>
"And? Why are you walking around brainwashed here?" (Naofumi)<br/>
"That is… When we were trying to evacuate people… A person began attacking from within our midst and… I can’t remember anything else." (Soldier)<br/>
So it was a Zombie Outbreak after that.<br/>
When even a single infected person gets in, a safe building becomes a prison with no escape.<br/>
In hindsight, I’d say that their organization was bad.<br/>
However, only criminals would be able to immediately assume that their allies were suddenly brainwashed.<br/>
Even though Melty told tales of the brainwashing Demon Lord, stories are stories. Jumping to a conclusion based on them is a tad bit hasty.<br/>
Even if I remembered the tale, I’d collect a bit more information first.<br/>
In that situation, perhaps the best course of action would to be to hold down the fort and wait for reinforcements.<br/>
At least at this point in time.<br/>
Or perhaps there is meaning in holding down the fort in itself.<br/>
Causing this incident… probably isn’t their final goal.<br/>
Even if the Revolutionary faction gets taken out, various problems will remain and outside countries will take advantage of those.<br/>
Even if the Queen were only pretending to be my ally, based on her position, she wouldn’t take such risks.<br/>
I don’t have enough information. I need to gather some more.<br/>
"Then Witch is waiting for you guys to open up the castle?" (Naofumi)<br/>
"Unfortunately…" (Soldier)<br/>
I have no idea what state the castle is in. I guess I have no choice but to drag these guys along.<br/>
Looking at it from a different perspective, the fact that we… The fact that Rishia is here means that we’re able to destroy the foundations of their plan.<br/>
If we keep dispelling the brainwashing, their forces will be lower than expected.<br/>
"Okay. First, we’ll need a full grasp of the situation. We’ll need to confirm the Queen’s safety." (Naofumi)<br/>
"Yes!" (Soldier)<br/>
"Do you know where she is?" (Naofumi)<br/>
"I think she’s holed up at the top of the castle." (Soldier)<br/>
"Then we’ll head there." (Naofumi)<br/>
Taking the soldiers with us, we head towards the Queen.<br/>
