    <p>Thank you, everyone, for purchasing the eighth volume of 『Cooking with Wild Game』.</p>

    <p>I informed everyone in the last volume that this book will comprise of several short stories.</p>

    <p>It is mainly about the events before the denizens of the Forest’s Edge face off against the nobles.</p>

    <p>The chapters are short, but these aren’t side stories, and I hope the readers can enjoy this volume as usual.</p>

    <p>Thinking back to how I felt when penning this part where the denizens started opposing the Tsun clan and nobles, the all-important cooking element got sidelined. I wrote these side stories back then with such feelings of regret.</p>

    <p>When writing these short stories, I intentionally separated it with the previous volume. I wanted to describe life in the Forest’s Edge in further detail from the new chapter onwards.</p>

    <p>I’m sorry for analyzing my own work so objectively, but these stories were written by me in late 2014 to early 2015, and it had been a year and a half since then.</p>

    <p>It is really surprising how time flies.</p>

    <p>When the book is published, I won’t normally think about the time when I first wrote the draft, but this volume left a deep impression on me.</p>

    <p><a id="ftnref20"></a>Why? In the uploaded post for the New Year of 2015 I intentionally made Asuta say: 「Congratulations! I will be in your care in the future too.」.<a href="../Text/Notes.xhtml#ftn20" epub:type="noteref">[20]</a></p>

    <p>I can publish my story online immediately, that’s why I can pull off such a playful move. I removed these words in the book version, so the readers can guess where Asuta said that line.</p>

    <p>For the side story, I wrote something from the perspective of Vena Wu.</p>

    <p>This story fills me with emotions.</p>

    <p>I thought up this story a long time ago and decided to write it out one day.</p>

    <p>Without any spoilers, this is about Vena Wu meeting a certain character five years ago. People who read the main story might be curious: 「Vena Wu’s residence is so far from that person’s house, so how did they meet?」 This is my answer.</p>

    <p>The women in Forest’s Edge don’t really spend much time heading to other people’s house. If two people live too far apart, they might not get to know each other forever. At most, they might meet each other when shopping in the Post Station Town.</p>

    <p>And so, when that character appeared in the main story, why did Vena Wu know her? This is the reason I thought up, and to this day, I never had the chance to write it in detail.</p>

    <p>I checked, and that character debuted in the main story in October 2014, which is volume five of the book version.</p>

    <p>When I saw that character debut two years later, I felt glad that I could finally unveil how that character met Vena Wu.</p>

    <p>That’s all for the afterword in this volume, my page count is done.</p>

    <p>These might just be some behind-the-scene stories, but I feel this is the interesting part of an afterward, and I hope everyone will like it.</p>

    <p>Well then, I will sign off, as usual, by thanking my editor from HOBBY JAPAN, the illustrator Kochimo-sensei, all the staff who helped in the publishing of this volume, and all the readers who bought this book.</p>

    <p>Let’s meet again in the next volume!</p>

    <p>August 2016, EDA</p>
