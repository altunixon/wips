<br/>
Though I have a hunch about the Lemo’s gender, the characters have been using gender-neutral phrasing up until not, so I will keep it that way for a while. About the translations of 149-150, it was just a step up from complete machine translation, so I think me and KookieDreamer will re-translate them. It’s like Elena and Bitch. Sure, Elena may be exponentially better and more likable than Bitch, but in Naofumi’s eyes, they’re both trash.<br/>
Chapter 147: The Flag, again<br/>
"What do you plan on doing with that?" (Rafatalia)<br/>
I meet up again with Rafatalia.<br/>
"I’m going to make some simple sunglasses." (Naofumi)<br/>
"But weren’t there some being sold back there?" (Rafatalia)<br/>
Well I guess this world already has the concept. The history of sunglasses dated back quite far in my world.<br/>
I guess it’s the same for this one.<br/>
"You have to think economically in times like this." (Naofumi)<br/>
It seems that buying a pre-made pair is quite expensive.<br/>
If I just buy a cheap frame, and cut the wing to size…<br/>
"And it’s done!" (Naofumi)<br/>
I put the simple sunglasses over to the Lemo child’s face.<br/>
"Umm…" (Lemo Kid)<br/>
The Lemo Child shows a troubled face upon receiving the glasses.<br/>
"Rafatalia." (Naofumi)<br/>
"On it." (Rafatalia)<br/>
Rafatalia casts darkness magic on the Child’s face once again.<br/>
"Ah…" (Lemo Kid)<br/>
"Are you alright? It’s not too bright, is it?" (Rafatalia)<br/>
"I’m fine…" (Lemo Kid)<br/>
The Lemo Child replies while fidgeting with its hands.<br/>
"Then shall we go?" (Rafatalia)<br/>
"Yes." (Lemo Kid)<br/>
To make sure it didn’t run, we hold hands with the Lemo.<br/>
Well, I guess the slave seal will prevent that anyways.<br/>
"T-thank you." (Lemo Kid)<br/>
"Don’t mind it. Where I live, there are plenty of brats like you." (Naofumi)<br/>
"Eh?" (Lemo Kid)<br/>
"This person here is the Hero of the Shield." (Rafatalia)<br/>
"EEEH!?" (Lemo Kid)<br/>
To only realize that now… I’m pretty sure the Slave Dealer already called me that a few times.<br/>
We continue to walk down an alley.<br/>
"Is that one of your kids, Hero of the Shield?" (???)<br/>
A passerby calls out to me.<br/>
"Hm?" (Naofumi)<br/>
It’s the manager of the clothing shop.<br/>
It really has been a while since we last met. Not since I requested the clothing for Firo.<br/>
I know why, but she gives off an Otaku-like feeling.<br/>
And one that tilts in the direction of a Fujoshi.<br/>
"You have a Beastman with you this time, what have you been up to?" (Tailor)<br/>
"You didn’t hear from the old man at the weapons shop?" (Naofumi)<br/>
I take off the hood of the cloak and begin speaking.<br/>
"Ah, right. I vaguely recall hearing something about it." (Tailor)<br/>
"You really…" (Naofumi)<br/>
"I’ve been thinking about it for a while, but the Demi-Human who’s always with you really is pretty. Won’t you stop by to dress her up?" (Tailor)<br/>
"Expensive clothes are… a bit…" (Rafatalia)<br/>
Due to my influence, Rafatalia has learned to live quite economically. I think she would prefer some armor for efficiency’s sake.<br/>
"That’s such a waste. Clothing is essential if you want to woo men." (Tailor)<br/>
"I-is that true…?" (Rafatalia)<br/>
It seems this will take a while.<br/>
I don’t care one bit about woman’s fashion, so I kinda want to leave.<br/>
"…and that’s why it’s good. Is this child a Lemo? I think I’m getting some inspiration." (Tailor)<br/>
"Wa, wa…" (Lemo Kid)<br/>
The Clothing shop manager pulls out a sketchbook and starts doodling in it.<br/>
As expected.<br/>
"Lately with the calamity, the town’s mood has gone down. No one’s buying clothing anymore." (Tailor)<br/>
She continues speaking as she draws.<br/>
"My store also sells armor, but its main purpose is clothing." (Tailor)<br/>
"I see." (Naofumi)<br/>
"To be honest, I’ve been losing interest in making clothes lately. I haven’t been getting much inspiration lately." (Tailor)<br/>
I think that she said that the material for Firo’s clothes was very good.<br/>
"You know the girl you brought before. Making clothes for her was really fun. Could you bring her by again?" (Tailor)<br/>
"That cost quite a bit…" (Naofumi)<br/>
And Firo seems to be happy with just one set.<br/>
We’re not particularly in need of it, so I see no need to buy her any new clothes.<br/>
If we had that sort of extra money lying around, I would use it on more useful things.<br/>
Anyways, Firo is usually in her Monster form, so the dress isn’t even used often.<br/>
"Hmm… The Hero of the Shield has quite a few inspirational people." (Tailor)<br/>
It seems that her Lemo Race design series is completed.<br/>
On the page are a pair of overalls, a vest, and various other designs.<br/>
My slaves’ clothes… mostly consist of second-hand armor. This gives the town an adventurer’s guild-like atmosphere.<br/>
Buying them casual clothes will cost a bit…<br/>
Some cheap clothes from the Old Man is as much as we can currently afford.<br/>
I guess I should ask.<br/>
"I can only offer furs and some peculiar materials, but do you want to work in my village?" (Naofumi)<br/>
Her expression lights up.<br/>
"Are you serious!?" (Tailor)<br/>
"Y-yeah." (Naofumi)<br/>
"Are there more cute and interesting kids like this one?" (Tailor)<br/>
"I don’t know if they’ll meet your specifications, but my village has plenty of Demi-Human slaves."<br/>
"A-a-are there also male slaves there?"<br/>
"Of course." (Naofumi)<br/>
"Are you sure!?" (Tailor)<br/>
She seems to be extremely excited.<br/>
I have a bad feeling about this.<br/>
"I am a warrior on a quest for new inspiration. Please allow me to trouble you for a while." (Tailor)<br/>
W-wait…<br/>
The thing that hooked her seems to be the fact that there were male slaves…<br/>
This is bad. The people from my world who were of a similar personality to her, would think of ‘that’ when they heard the words ‘Male Slaves’. (TL: Most likely BL)<br/>
My decision may have been rash.<br/>
"T-then stop by to check the place out some time." (Naofumi)<br/>
"Yes! Of Course!" (Tailor)<br/>
And somehow the conversation was over.<br/>
…<br/>
After that, we parted ways with the clothing shop owner, and kept walking, when…<br/>
Kyurururururu…<br/>
A sound comes from the Lemo Slave’s stomach. The child begins acting embarrassed.<br/>
"… I guess we should stop somewhere to eat." (Naofumi)<br/>
"Yeah, we should" (Rafatalia)<br/>
"What does this one’s race eat? Is it fine to feed it like the other Demi-Humans? Should I give it worms?"<br/>
If it’s worms, then preparing food will be difficult.<br/>
I have the Dunes in the village, but those aren’t food.<br/>
If necessary, I will cook them, but if I do, it will be troublesome.<br/>
Taniko would shout at me.<br/>
"Um…well…" (Lemo Kid)<br/>
The Lemo Child tries to speak up.<br/>
"I went …from home… a few times… It seems we can eat normal food." (Lemo Kid)<br/>
"I see, then should we stop by a food stall?" (Naofumi)<br/>
"Naofumi-sama won’t cook?" (Rafatalia)<br/>
"We’ve come all the way to the Castle Town, and you still want me to cook? The smell will draw that person to us."(Naofumi)<br/>
I have a classrooms-worth of hungry children here. Even if I cook on the River Bank, I think Firo will notice and bring them there.<br/>
"Isn’t that fine?" (Rafatalia)<br/>
"Even if you’re fine with it, I will find it a pain." (Naofumi)<br/>
Recently, I’ve been trying to keep my cooking duty to a minimum.<br/>
There’s been a slave who came to me, wanting to improve her cooking skill.<br/>
"Eh-… I wanted to eat Shield Nii-chan’s cooking." (Kiel)<br/>
Is what most of the kids said.<br/>
It was quite difficult to encourage her to cook again after that.<br/>
"Anyways. Today, we are eating out." (Naofumi)<br/>
"I understand…" (Rafatalia)<br/>
And so we head back towards the market.<br/>
The merchant’s shop has a long line in front of it. And the merchant is happily selling his goods for many times the normal price. I applaud his skills.<br/>
Now then, where should we eat?<br/>
As I look for restaurants, I notice the place I first took Rafatalia to eat.<br/>
"Will here be fine?" (Naofumi)<br/>
"Yes." (Rafatalia)<br/>
"…" (Lumo Kid)<br/>
I hold the Lumo Slaves hand as we enter the building.<br/>
"Welc…ome" (Waiter)<br/>
The person who greets us frowns upon seeing me with a cloak covering my body.<br/>
"Sir. Serving a suspicious person accompanied by a Demi-Human is a bit…" (Waiter)<br/>
"… If you have such a rule, then hang it on the front door." (Naofumi)<br/>
"B-but still…" (Host)<br/>
Fumu… the host looks at the dirty Lemo Kid accompanying us, but doesn’t remark on it.<br/>
This reminds me of when I once brought Rafatalia here when she was still small. No one said anything at that time.<br/>
I guess I am being held up because Beastmen are feared more than other Demi-Humans.<br/>
There are plenty of people who wear cloaks, though many of them do so for suspicious reasons.<br/>
Most restaurants here should understand that. In my world most restaurants forbid the admittance of animals for sanitary reasons.<br/>
However in this world, Beastmen are supposed to be treated as Bonafide human beings.<br/>
But I guess the hatred of this country is quite deeply seated. There’s no choice.<br/>
I take off the cloak.<br/>
"Is this fine? There’s no suspicious person anymore. Will you still deny food to a Demi-Human and a Beastman?" (Naofumi)<br/>
"Ah…no… I-I understand." (Waiter)<br/>
With an amazed expression, the waiter leads us to a seat.<br/>
The Lemo slave fidgets as its eyes wander all over the room.<br/>
"This reminds me of the old Rafatalia." (Naofumi)<br/>
"Please don’t bring up that time." (Rafatalia)<br/>
"Do you want another Kid’s set lunch?" (Naofumi)<br/>
"I don’t need one!" (Rafatalia)<br/>
The Lemo slave can’t seem to calm down. Its gaze begins to drift to its feet.<br/>
"Is there anything you’d like to eat?" (Naofumi)<br/>
"Well…" (Lemo Kid)<br/>
The kid looks at the menu and gives a bitter face.<br/>
"I can’t read…" (Lemo Kid)<br/>
"Then should we order something for you?" (Naofumi)<br/>
"Please…" (Lemo Kid)<br/>
I raise my hand and call our server.<br/>
"One Daily Special and two Kids se-" (Naofumi)<br/>
"Two Daily Specials and one Kid’s set lunch." (Rafatalia)<br/>
Rafatalia interrupts me before I can finish.<br/>
"What’s wrong?" (Naofumi)<br/>
"Naofumi-sama, you’re mistaken. You still think I want that set, don’t you?" (Rafatalia)<br/>
"Even though you say that, you still kinda want it, right? It’s something the other villagers would happily eat." (Naofumi)<br/>
The last time she ate it, Rafatalia had carefully taken out and saved the flag.<br/>
"It’s fine. Please don’t treat me like a child." (Rafatalia)<br/>
Is she at a delicate age? Even though her body has gotten big, her mind should still be a child.<br/>
"I-is that everything?" (Waiter)<br/>
"Yeah, I’ll leave it to you." (Naofumi)<br/>
The waiter disappears into the back of the store.<br/>
I can faintly hear him saying something about the Hero of the Shield visiting.<br/>
After a while, the food arrives.<br/>
"Thank you for waiting. Here are your Daily Specials and Kid’s set lunch." (Waiter)<br/>
The Kid’s set lunch is more flashy than usual. There are two flags in the rice.<br/>
"…It’s showier than it was last time we were here." (Naofumi)<br/>
They’re definitely showing off.<br/>
Reputation is amazing… did the other heroes get this sort of treatment before as well?<br/>
Showing my face is inconvenient, but I guess I can get some things out of it.<br/>
"U-um…" (Lemo Kid)<br/>
I can hear the Lemo Slave swallowing its saliva.<br/>
"It’s fine, you can eat." (Naofumi)<br/>
"Is it really okay?" (Lemo Kid)<br/>
"Yeah." (Naofumi)<br/>
"You won’t drop the dish and make me eat off the floor?" (Lemo Kid)<br/>
"… Where the hell did you learn that? That’s a waste of food." (Naofumi)<br/>
So this one’s previous master made it eat off the ground.<br/>
"It’s fine, just eat however you like." (Naofumi)<br/>
It was like this with Rafatalia as well.<br/>
"You can eat when you want." (Rafatalia)<br/>
"Y-yes…" (Lemo Kid)<br/>
Rafatalia makes this interaction much easier.<br/>
The Lemo Child timidly begins eating the Kid’s set lunch.<br/>
Its using its hands. I guess it never really learned manners.<br/>
But Manner is something you can always learn later.<br/>
…Right now the slaves take food from a single dish in the center of the table.<br/>
It’s like eating with a large family.<br/>
I think back to around the time I got here. Back then I couldn’t taste anything. I thought that as long it was cheap, any food would do.<br/>
I look out the store’s window.<br/>
The Spirit Turtle’s shell looms high over the city… There are still more battles to come.<br/>
"Thank you very much." (Lemo Kid)<br/>
The Lemo Race slave begins stuffing its cheeks with the Kid’s set lunch in tears.<br/>
"If you think that, then eat it properly." (Naofumi)<br/>
If you leave any, I may get angry.<br/>
"But I won’t force you to eat anything your race cannot eat." (Naofumi)<br/>
I hope there isn’t too much of a difference in constitution.<br/>
"Yes" (Lemo Kid)<br/>
Like a mother, Rafatalia wipes the Lumo Child’s mouth and begins feeding it.<br/>
It’s quite a peaceful scene.<br/>
