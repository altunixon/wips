Prologue TOC NextTree, tree, tree… Turning around 360 degrees, there are thick trees growing everywhere I look. A lonely forest with no roads, my feet get covered in bushes with every step.

There should have been many alternatives, right?“Gururururu.”The person who I separated from a little while ago would probably permit me a complaint or two… While thinking so, I suddenly hear a beast’s growl and look around in panic.

I fire compressed air magic which resembles a bullet. The air bullet hits the target, the Red Wolf “Gyain.” whines and gets blown off backward. I feel relieved that I hit the target properly, but I’m still cautious in case it can still move.“This from the very beginning……”Haa… I sigh, approach the Red Wolf’s dead body and store it with “Infinite Storage”.
