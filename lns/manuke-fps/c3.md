I just went through my emails. I should have done it earlier. Really. Now i wasted almost 2 hours of my life.<br/>
A guy translated Manuke FPS Chapter 3 and sent me his translation. I do not mind translating my stuff, but tell me beforehand. Well, this actually made checking his translation easier as I have almost finished translating it and believe it or not, it’s accurate. But I still feel bad about wasting my time. The rest of the day will be depressing while drinking beer and thinking how bad it is to waste your time.<br/>
Without more words, here is the link to it:<br/>
Manuke FPS Chapter 3<br/>
And now I will cry myself to sleep.<br/>
Edit: I broke the link by mistake ❤ Fixed immediately<br/>
