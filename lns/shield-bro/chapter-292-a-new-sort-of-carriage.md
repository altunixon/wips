I… I have no idea what to do. I’ve finished 294 and 295, and I’m in the middle of 296…<br/>
Chapter 292: A New Sort of Carriage<br/>
After my talk with the Queen, I met up with Raphtalia’s group. We headed to the Old Man’s weapon shop.<br/>
I handed him the necessary materials beforehand, so there shouldn’t be any problems.<br/>
If there is one, it would be…<br/>
"Oh? If it isn’t you, kid. You never stopped by, so I was wondering what happened." (Old Man)<br/>
"Well, stuff went down…" (Naofumi)<br/>
Ah, my heart aches.<br/>
I seriously set out for world domination.<br/>
Even if I get beaten half to death, I’ll never admit it.<br/>
"You see, Master-" (Firo)<br/>
"If you say anymore, you get no carriage." (Naofumi)<br/>
"Uu…" (Firo)<br/>
Our little birdy is way too talkative.<br/>
And why can Firo figure out and say exactly the things people are trying to hide?<br/>
She’s been reserved as of late, but from the start, she’s been overly intrusive.<br/>
I quiet Firo, and ask about the carriage.<br/>
"And how goes the carriage I placed an order for?" (Naofumi)<br/>
"I finished it long ago. You didn’t come by for a while, and I didn’t have anywhere to store it, so I left it with an acquaintance." (Old Man)<br/>
The Old Man explains where he left the carriage, and I hand over the money.<br/>
Since I was gone for a long time, I ended up paying for parking fees as well.<br/>
"Okay, I’ve definitely received the payment. If you take this paper, and that Holy Bird girl with you, they should just hand it over." (Old Man)<br/>
"I see." (Naofumi)<br/>
"Then I’ll be off to get it now~!" (Firo)<br/>
I give Firo the paper the Old Man handed me, and send her to get it.<br/>
She runs off energetically, and returns a few minutes later pulling a sparkling carriage.<br/>
That was fast.<br/>
She appears to be having a lot of fun.<br/>
"Um you see… It’s really sparkly, and well made… It’s really cool!" (Firo)<br/>
I confirm the carriage she brought over.<br/>
It’s a little bigger than the previous one.<br/>
It’s supposed to be a metal carriage, but… The axels and wheels give off a mechanical feeling. It looks somewhat like… the prototype for a car.<br/>
"If you get the guy at your place to make some new wheels for it, you can do various things." (Old Man)<br/>
"Like those ones with spikes?" (Firo)<br/>
What do you plan on doing with spiked wheels?<br/>
Is this monster planning on running down monsters in our path?<br/>
"Next, well, if I put power onto this handle, the carriage becomes really light!" (Firo)<br/>
Firo firmly grasps the handle, and the body of the carriage appears to float.<br/>
Fumu… does it have functions to control its weight?<br/>
"It’s made of Graweik Ore, so it can float, you know." (Old Man)<br/>
"Is it based on the Air Walk ability?" (Naofumi)<br/>
"That’s right. Have you never seen one? The rocks that fly in the sky?" (Old Man)<br/>
… I have.<br/>
It’s rare, but occasionally, I see some rock-like things flying in the sky.<br/>
They helped me reaffirm that this was indeed another world. Is this made with that ore?<br/>
I look at the Old Man, and he nods.<br/>
"The raw ore can float, but when you use it in manufacturing, it just makes things lighter. In the past, we apparently had the technology to keep them afloat, but it was lost." (Old Man)<br/>
Ah, I think I saw it on the list of ingredients the Old Man had me procure.<br/>
I just handed the sheet over to the Queen, and left it to her, though.<br/>
"Using it in abundance, the carriage can levitate slightly. The stronger you grasp the handle, the more magic it will take from the holder, and the lighter it will get." (Old Man)<br/>
"Wah… Then if Firo puts in enough power, can it fly?" (Firo)<br/>
"I just said it didn’t I, bird princess. Flight is impossible." (Old Man)<br/>
"Eh?" (Firo)<br/>
"I wonder." (Naofumi)<br/>
The power of flight is lost upon refining the ore but you can increase its effect by pouring in magic.<br/>
I take out an item imbued with magic amplification I created with Item Creation, and mix in Chi. I grasp the carriage’s handles.<br/>
… This sucks up quite a bit of magic.<br/>
"Wah!"<br/>
The carriage suddenly lifts itself slightly off of the ground.<br/>
"Firo too~" (Firo)<br/>
Firo flaps her wings to build up magic… something the strange me thought up.<br/>
The carriage begins floating even higher.<br/>
"Oh… Amazing." (Old Man)<br/>
The Old Man shows his interest.<br/>
But, with this…<br/>
"AUUUU…"<br/>
With a bang, the carriage crashes into the ground.<br/>
By mixing Magic and Chi, this was my limit.<br/>
"I could only get it to lift off for a short time." (Naofumi)<br/>
"… Flying carriage…" (Firo)<br/>
It’s an idea overflowing with romance.<br/>
I also want one. Because it seems convenient.<br/>
"Anyways, you’ve shown me quite an interesting thing. What will you have me make next?" (Old Man)<br/>
"Let’s see…" (Naofumi)<br/>
At the moment, I’m not in need of weapons or armor.<br/>
And I have no materials.<br/>
The strange me generously used all of my rare materials without remorse.<br/>
But since the wave is upon us, we’re going levelling every day.<br/>
I can’t compound, so I go out with Raphtalia and Firo to raise my level as well.<br/>
I get materials out of that, and have things made.<br/>
But I gave the orders to Imya’s Uncle, so I don’t really have anything to ask of the Old Man…<br/>
"I’d like a sword for Raphtalia." (Naofumi)<br/>
"Me?" (Raphtalia)<br/>
Raphtalia seems confused.<br/>
Due to the effects of the Raph Shield, Raphtalia’s been strengthened even further.<br/>
And that’s on top of the three months she spent training with the Granny to power up.<br/>
Her level is maxed out at 100, so I want to get her worthy equipment.<br/>
According to Ren and the others, Houou is quite strong.<br/>
I’d like to fight him with my forces in perfect condition.<br/>
"Yeah, could you possible make something with the Spirit Turtle’s materials?" (Naofumi)<br/>
"That will be a bit expensive, but are you okay with that?" (Old Man)<br/>
"Yes. Can you make something like the Spirit Turtle Sword I told you about before?" (Naofumi)<br/>
It’s the blade Ren damaged beyond repair.<br/>
If we still had it, I think Raphtalia would be stronger.<br/>
"Do you need anything, Fohl? Since you fight unarmed, do you want any gauntlets?" (Naofumi)<br/>
"I… no wait, do you plan on increasing my debt?" (Fohl)<br/>
"I’m glad you understand." (Naofumi)<br/>
I mean, he’s fighting to pay off his debt. I bet he’ll leave my village once he earns enough.<br/>
Though that will be after we take care of Houou.<br/>
"I don’t need it!" (Fohl)<br/>
"I see. I thought you would want it to have an edge over your sister." (Naofumi)<br/>
"Are you trying to get me to kill Atlas!?" (Fohl)<br/>
"Do you not know the concept of holding back…?" (Naofumi)<br/>
If you have a weapon, do you think you can defeat her?<br/>
That girl’s great with dodging and rolling. She has a strange sense for it.<br/>
She plays with Firo a lot, and she trained with me, so she knows how to defend as well.<br/>
Her fighting style is fundamentally defensive. It’s a style where she waits for an opening in the opponent’s stance before attacking.<br/>
Ah, does he mean Atlas isn’t on a level where he can hold back?<br/>
If that’s the case, then I understand.<br/>
"I recommend these nunchucks and tonfas from the far east." (Old Man)<br/>
"I refuse!" (Fohl)<br/>
Why is he acting up here?<br/>
I think having a weapon will help him in battle.<br/>
But I guess it’s fine.<br/>
Next is Firo, but…<br/>
"What’s wrong, master?" (Firo)<br/>
… I got her a carriage, so that matter’s okay, I guess.<br/>
Imya’s uncle said he could make something with the materials Sadina salvaged.<br/>
I’ll have him make some claws.<br/>
Yeah. I’ll have the Old Man make just the sword this time.<br/>
"Then please make a sword by the next wave. Don’t skimp out on costs. I’ll take the limited resources from my place over, so choose what you need from there." (Naofumi)<br/>
I remember Imya’s Uncle looking through them and making a list.<br/>
I hand the list to the Old Man.<br/>
"Fumu… you have some interesting materials here. I’ll need this and this. I’ll make a better sword than the one you saw before, just wait and see." (Old Man)<br/>
"I’ll do just that." (Naofumi)<br/>
"Got it." (Old Man)<br/>
"Then Firo, we can’t take the carriage by Portal, so make sure to take it home." (Naofumi)<br/>
"Yay!" (firo)<br/>
I take the list of required materials from the Old Man, and return to the village.<br/>
The Filo Rials gaze at Firo’s carriage with envy now, for some reason.<br/>
I believe Filo Rials had some form of pride among carriages.<br/>
Firo holds her head high among the flock of birds.<br/>
The others gaze at me, but… don’t stare at me like that.<br/>
