"These dishes are from Alan’s homeland, and he has taught the cooking methods to the chef of this inn. Right now, they are my favorite dishes. It looks like tonight will be a feast."<br/>
"Oh! So these are dishes from Alan-dono’s homeland! I am looking forward to tasting them!"<br/>
I ordered some ale from Sara-chan as well. The only one who ordered ale apart from me was Captain Dalshim.<br/>
"Alan! These dishes are absolutely delicious!" Sharon praised.  <br/>
"I see. I’m glad you like them."<br/>
"Princess… Just what are these dishes?"<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
"Aren’t they delicious? Alan’s culinary skills do not pale in comparison to his magic and swordsmanship, I’ll have you know. Go ahead and eat. They will be gone before you know it."<br/>
Cleria was eating heartily as she said that. Well, we can always order seconds anyway.  I’m sure we won’t be running out of food any time soon. Apart from me and Elna, the rest finished off their portions with record speed and ordered seconds right away.<br/>
"Fuu. I am stuffed. I ate too much again." Sharon quipped.<br/>
"The world sure is wide. To think there would exist dishes this delicious. I would have to make sure I live long enough to taste more." Roberto chimed in.<br/>
"The meals were excellent tonight as well. Alan, I feel that the sauce used in tonight’s tonkatsu was a little different from usual…"<br/>
"As expected of Cleria. So you really did manage to notice. …That Verse. So he finally did it."<br/>
At that moment, Verse came to our table to take away the empty plates.<br/>
"So you’ve finally done it, Verse. The sauce was the best."<br/>
The one used for tonight’s sauce was a close reproduction of Earth’s Japanese-style sauce. There was of course a slight difference in the taste, but it was still an impressive feat.  I’m sure that with a little more adjustments, it will become perfect. I also worked on developing the sauce with Verse in my free time, but this is clearly a huge step forward.<br/>
"So I really did nail it! That taste was the one we were aiming for, right!? The taste was perfect for tonkatsu. I came to that conclusion a while back, so I wanted to confirm it with you."<br/>
"Yeah. You did well with recreating that flavor. Tonkatsu definitely needs to be paired up with that sauce. You just need to adjust its consistency a bit, and it will be perfect."<br/>
"I see. So I need to adjust the consistency. I overlooked that. Alright then. I’ll get to it right now…"<br/>
"Um, Verse? Can I have some of your time first?"<br/>
"Yes. Alright. I’ve mostly finished up with the cooking anyway. The rest of the guests have all gone back to their rooms as well. What is it?"<br/>
I ran my gaze around the room and found that apart from us, there was only one other table that had guests sitting around it. <br/>
"I see. Well, I just have some things I want to ask you. Can you hear me out for a while?"<br/>
"Alright. Ask me whatever you want. Sara! Bring us some more ale!"<br/>
"No, it won’t take that long anyway. It’s just that we’ve decided to finally start actively working as adventurers, you see. I wanted to consult with you because you said you were formerly an A rank adventurer, Verse."<br/>
"Oh yeah. You guys are adventurers as well. To tell you the truth, it kinda slipped my mind already. So, what do you want to ask?"<br/>
"Um, if we want to raise our rank at a fast rate, is adventuring within the Great Demon Forest the best choice?"<br/>
"Well, that’s the case, yeah. Compared to the Great Demon Forest, the number of monsters wandering around the area near the city is significantly lower. The rewards for quests that require you to go there are usually on the higher side, and you can also hunt monster types that are worth a lot of money. Well, the accompanying danger is also quite high though."<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
"I see. Do you have any tips for effectively raising our rank at a fast rate?"<br/>
"Well, this goes without saying, but whenever you come to the Guild to accept quests, try to find ones that others aren’t very willing to take. And if possible, you’d also want quests that would make other Guilds apart from the Adventurer’s Guild owe you favors when done successfully." <br/>
"What do you mean by that?"<br/>
"For example, a request put forth by the Commerce Guild to subjugate bandits. The points for accomplishing that kind of request will generally be more than other quests in the same rank."<br/>
"Why is that?"<br/>
"I wonder. Maybe those guys at the top of the Adventurer’s Guild are quite happy about being able to have other Guilds owe them favors as well? This isn’t something well known among the lower ranks, but the A and S rank adventurers are all aware of it."  <br/>
"I see. That’s some good advice. Speaking of which, I heard something about S ranked adventurers being granted a noble title if they accomplish something monumental. Is that really the case?" <br/>
"Oh, that. Yeah, that can happen. And it isn’t just limited to S rankers. It’s also possible for A rankers to get promoted to nobility as well. Our former party was one such case. Our party once performed great merits in repelling a monster stampede a while back, so our former leader ended up getting promoted to nobility. Well, he was just granted the lowest rank of Baronet though."<br/>
"Wow, that’s amazing! Did you not get an opportunity as well, Verse?"<br/>
"I wasn’t the leader after all, and I sure as heck don’t wanna become nobility anyway. It was a hellish battle. Almost half of the adventurers that responded to that crisis didn’t make it back alive. I finally got sick of the adventurer life after that, so I took the money I saved up over the years and opened this inn instead."<br/>
"I see. Well, I guess this life turned out better for you in the end, Verse."<br/>
After talking about his experiences as an adventurer a bit more, Verse got back to cleaning up the plates.<br/>
After having some after-meal tea, we all went to Cleria’s room in order to discuss our plans further.<br/>
"Well, based on what Verse said earlier, it seems there’s a good chance of getting promoted to nobility."<br/>
"Yes, it seems so. Since the Great Demon Forest serves as the stage for battles against monsters, it is even more likely to gain peerage through adventuring here compared to in Starveek Kingdom.  <br/>
"It’s decided then. We will adventure around the Great Demon Forest, raise our adventurer rank, and aim for promotion to nobility. This will be our main goal as of now, right, Alan?"<br/>
"Yes. Let’s do so."<br/>
"Your Highness, in which country will we be aiming to have Alan-dono get his peerage? Cecilio Kingdom or here at the Belta Kingdom? I think there are equal opportunities for promotion in both countries, but…"<br/>
"Because we will be aiming for hegemony over the entire continent in the future, starting out in either one of them will be much the same. However, I have decided that this country, that had caused my precious royal guards to perish needlessly, shall be the first to be sacrificed for our cause!"  <br/>
""Oooh!""<br/>
Elna and Captain Dalshim seemed touched by Cleria’s words.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Afterward, it was decided that Captain Dalshim and Baron Sergio were to return to Cecilio Kingdom in order to gather their subordinates and tell them about our future plans. It seems Captain Dalshim planned to gather all the surviving royal guards and join up with us once more as soon as possible. We then discussed the methods in order to contact them.<br/>
Captain Dalshim requested that a few royal guards accompany us for the meantime, but Cleria refused. <br/>
"I am no longer royalty. Right now, I am just an adventurer aiming for a quick promotion. There is no need for any guards. Well then, Alan. Shall we begin our activities tomorrow?" <br/>
"Yeah, okay. No, wait! I actually ended up accepting a job order earlier. So we won’t be able to start adventuring until four days from now."<br/>
I was scheduled to get my order of casings and switches for making the dryers in three days. I can finish putting them all together in one day, so I needed at least four days before we could set off. And we also need to prepare a lot of things before we head out. Oh, and there’s Selena and Sharon’s armors as well.<br/>
"I see. Well, it can’t be helped because it’s a job you accepted.  Alright then, we shall depart after four days."<br/>
"Yeah. We can’t just leave straight away. We need to prepare, and we also need to say our goodbyes to the people who’ve been a great help to us as well."<br/>
"Oh, right. Well then, we shall start preparing for the journey by tomorrow." <br/>
We’ll need to buy some ingredients and cooking tools as well. We also need to procure some horses and a carriage. I can’t leave all that to Cleria after all. I’ll go to Tarus-san’s shop tomorrow then. It looks like we’re gonna be pretty busy. <br/>
