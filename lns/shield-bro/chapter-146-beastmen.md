Chapter 146: Beastmen<br/>
"Ah, Naofumi-sama" (Rafatalia)<br/>
I stop by the Slave Dealer’s tent, and Rafatalia greets me.<br/>
"My, My. Is it not the Hero of the Shield?" (Slave Dealer)<br/>
"You. You did something unnecessary for my slaves. I am quite troubled, you know." (Naofumi)<br/>
"Now then, what could you be talking about?" (Slave Dealer)<br/>
The Slave dealer forces a laugh.<br/>
If I try to push this point too hard, I will get sucked into his pace. I guess I’ll drop it.<br/>
"Anyways, I came across a large amount of monster eggs, so I would like to cancel my order." (Naofumi)<br/>
"I thought you would say that, so I took the liberty of cancelling it for you. Yes." (Slave Dealer)<br/>
"You…" (Naofumi)<br/>
Calm down… Calm down…<br/>
"Would you like another Filo Rial? I don’t believe there was one in the eggs you had." (Slave Dealer)<br/>
"So you already checked them!" (Naofumi)<br/>
I’m reaching my limit here.<br/>
I hate feeling like I’m dancing on the palm of his hand.<br/>
"I think it would be more entertaining for you to find out when they hatch. Yes" (Slave Dealer)<br/>
My head hurts.<br/>
This happens every time I see this person.<br/>
It’s annoying, so I’ll just finish my business here and leave.<br/>
"Then, did you find any more slaves from that village?" (Naofumi)<br/>
"Well…" (Rafatalia)<br/>
Rafatalia’s expression becomes dark.<br/>
"I apologize, but we have yet to find any more." (Slave Dealer)<br/>
"I see…" (Naofumi)<br/>
"I even spread around the Hero of the Shield’s name, and no one came forward. I don’t think I will be able to find any more within the confines of Melromark." (Slave Dealer)<br/>
"Fumu…" (Naofumi)<br/>
Though we have been able to find quite a few children, I guess not too many people survived the wave in the first place.<br/>
I have found 15 already… (TL: remember, 3 of the 18 were outsiders)<br/>
"It may be beneficial to increase the search range. Yes." (Slave Dealer)<br/>
"Can you do that?" (Naofumi)<br/>
"If the Hero of the Shield asks for it, I have no choice but to oblige." (Slave Dealer)<br/>
This sounds fishy. The Slave dealer extends his hand to me as if asking for money.<br/>
"After that is… Do you have any skilled Demi-Human slaves that would be of use to me?" (Naofumi)<br/>
Having someone skilled at compounding, construction or black smithery may help the growth of the village.<br/>
The only one there who can make intermediate-advanced medicine is me.<br/>
There are a few that have shown interest in the subject but progress has been slow.<br/>
"Then the Tanuki girl you have with you may be considered quite skillful." (Slave Dealer)<br/>
I look at Rafatalia.<br/>
Now that I think about it, I haven’t actually taught her anything… The most I’ve had her do is tan leather.<br/>
Well, she is quite clumsy in most aspects besides fighting.<br/>
"Were you just thinking something relatively rude?" (Rafatalia)<br/>
"Not really…" (Naofumi)<br/>
"Let’s see… Well, the Lemo Race is quite good with their hands. They’re also relatively docile." (Slave Dealer)<br/>
"Hmm…" (Naofumi)<br/>
"You’ve probably never seen one before, though. Yes." (Slave Dealer)<br/>
"Are they rare?" (Naofumi)<br/>
"They’re not rare in other countries, but as they are considered Beastmen, their numbers in Melromark are few. Yes." (Slave Dealer)<br/>
I see…<br/>
Are they closer to animals than other Demi-humans? Now that I think about it, all of the Demi-humans I’ve seen so far have been quite humanoid.<br/>
"Do you have any here?" (Naofumi)<br/>
"Yes, you may be in luck. I have one in stock." (Slave Dealer)<br/>
"Let me see." (Naofumi)<br/>
The Slave Dealer leads me into the depths of the tent.<br/>
"Here it is."<br/>
I look at the cage I have been led to.<br/>
In it is a child cowering in fear under a blanket.<br/>
It’s dark, so I can’t really see anything.<br/>
"Fumu…" (Naofumi)<br/>
"Present it." (Slave Dealer)<br/>
At the Slave Dealer’s command, a muscular man appears, and opens the cage. He takes away its blanket.<br/>
"S-stop it!" (Lemo Kid)<br/>
"…" (Naofumi)<br/>
I look at the Lemo Child.<br/>
To describe it briefly, it looked like a mole. It’s a werewolf-like fusion between a human and a mole.<br/>
It looks like the Lemo are a race of mole-people.<br/>
Its stature is quite short. Its height only comes up to my waist. Is it because it is a child?<br/>
"It is of a race who’s eyes are weak to light. You may be able to use it for nighttime patrols." (Slave Dealer)<br/>
"awawa…." (Lemo Kid)<br/>
The Lemo Child huddles into a corner of the cage, whilst trembling.<br/>
Rafatalia has a worried expression.<br/>
"Rafatalia." (Naofumi)<br/>
"Yes?" (Rafatalia)<br/>
"You understand that I’m no philanthropist, right?" (Naofumi)<br/>
"Y-yeah, I realize that." (Rafatalia)<br/>
Even so, it’s a race that is skilled in craftsmanship…<br/>
but…<br/>
"Hey, do a lot of people in this country persecute Demi-Human slaves?" (Naofumi)<br/>
Many of the Demi-human children slaves had remnants of scars left by whips all over their bodies.<br/>
"A while ago, this country was at war with Demi-Humans, there’s no helping it. Yes." (Slave Dealer)<br/>
"So people are still taking out their anger from that time on these races?" (Naofumi)<br/>
"Well, it’s war. Many people lost their families to the Demi-humans, and this country’s military campaigns brought an influx of cheap Demi-Human slaves. Yes. There was no easier way for those people to get revenge on Demi-Humans as a whole." (Slave Dealer)<br/>
This country’s darkness runs deep.<br/>
I wonder what the nobles think of me, who is making a Demi-Human village.<br/>
"Though slavery is legal in this country, mistreatment of slaves is punishable by law. Yes." (Slave Dealer)<br/>
"Those actions were illegal… You seem to be selling quite a few of such illegal slaves…" (Naofumi)<br/>
Now that I think about it, this tent is quite well hidden, in a back alley…<br/>
"Don’t worry. I am conducting business quite legally. Yes." (Slave Dealer)<br/>
Legal…<br/>
The Slave Dealer looks proud as he says this, but something in my head is screaming bull shit.<br/>
If so, then why do you carry abused slaves in the first place…<br/>
"Well, there’s nothing I can do about it." (Naofumi)<br/>
I look at the wounds on the back of the Lemo kid.<br/>
…They look quite deep.<br/>
「Zveit Heal」(Naofumi)<br/>
I use healing magic, and the wounds slowly close.<br/>
But the wounds were quite severe. I can’t heal them completely.<br/>
"Eh?" (Lemo Kid)<br/>
"Hey, you. I heard you are quite skillful." (Naofumi)<br/>
"…I don’t know." (Lemo Kid)<br/>
The Lemo slave hides its face as it says this.<br/>
It’s a better reply than claiming to do something that you can’t.<br/>
"If I taught you something, could you do it?" (Naofumi)<br/>
"… if you order it, I would have to do it. So… don’t hit me…" (Lemo Kid)<br/>
The Lemo slave sounds like it is about to cry. It curls itself into a tighter ball.<br/>
But as the rest of the cage is empty, it still stands out.<br/>
"Fufu…" (Rafatalia)<br/>
Rafatalia looks at me and laughs a bit. What is she on about?<br/>
"Should I prepare the slave seal?" (Slave Dealer)<br/>
"Yeah." (Naofumi)<br/>
And so we apply the slave seal to the Lemo child. I am already used to the process.<br/>
"Ah, I just remembered. Hero of the Shield." (Slave Dealer)<br/>
"What? I won’t cook you anything." (Naofumi)<br/>
"That’s unfortunate, but there is something I must warn you about." (Slave Dealer)<br/>
"Hm?" (Naofumi)<br/>
"There seems to be a Mad Alchemist in this country who focuses on monster experimentation. Be careful." (Slave Dealer) (TL: O…nii..chan…Da…ddy…)<br/>
The Queen said the same thing. Is he really that dangerous?<br/>
"The Hero of the Shield’s monsters all seem to grow abnormally. You may get targeted soon." (Slave Dealer)<br/>
"Yes, Yes. Got it." (Naofumi)<br/>
I casually let it slide as I exit the Slave Dealer’s tent.<br/>
"I-it’s too bright…" (Lemo Kid)<br/>
The Lemo Slave follows me while keeping both of its hands on its eyes.<br/>
Oh right. This race was weak to light.<br/>
Rafatalia casts some magic, and dims the light around the slave’s face.<br/>
"Will this be alright?" (Rafatalia)<br/>
"Ah… Yes." (Lemo Kid)<br/>
Right, Rafatalia’s best magic was Light and Darkness. She could manipulate them to create illusions.<br/>
The Class Up let her use more types of magic, but that magic seems to remain her specialty.<br/>
A mole Beastman.<br/>
Perhaps we should get some sunglasses.<br/>
What sort of environment does this race usually live in?<br/>
But sunglasses…<br/>
As I walk through town, I see a stand selling spectacles.<br/>
"Hey." (Naofumi)<br/>
"How can I help you?" (Glasses Vendor)<br/>
I address the person selling the specs.<br/>
"Do you have any glasses with darkened lenses? I’m looking for a pair." (Naofumi)<br/>
"We have some." (Glasses Vendor)<br/>
The Vendor takes out a sample and puts it on the table.<br/>
The lenses are definitely black… what are they made of? It doesn’t seem to be glass… Is it some part of a monster?<br/>
It seems to be made of ‘Black Fly Wings’. It’s a monster I’ve yet to meet.<br/>
I wonder where they live.<br/>
I understand it probably isn’t common. It’s probably in a cave, or in the mountains or somewhere else difficult to reach by carriage.<br/>
"…That will be 80 Copper." (Glasses Vendor)<br/>
It’s basic business to increase the price if someone shows interest.<br/>
"Hmm… I see. Then I guess we should give up for now." (Naofumi)<br/>
I give the glasses back to the vendor and head towards another merchant’s shop.<br/>
He should know my face.<br/>
However I make sure to conceal myself with the cloak.<br/>
"Do you happen to have any Black Fly Wing?" (Naofumi)<br/>
"Wha?" (Merchant)<br/>
Upon hearing my voice, the merchant seems a bit startled.<br/>
Perhaps he figured out my identity. He puts on a suspicious smile.<br/>
"Ah, remember the time with the balloons?" (Naofumi)<br/>
(TL: It is implied that this merchant was the first victim of the balloons Naofumi kept under his robe)<br/>
"I-I won’t treat you like that again!" (Merchant)<br/>
"Anyways, do you have any?" (Naofumi)<br/>
"I have some. I have some, so please stop pressuring me." (Merchant)<br/>
"That depends on your actions." (Naofumi)<br/>
The merchant frantically brings out the requested goods.<br/>
Black Fly Wing<br/>
Quality: Poor<br/>
"It’s quality is poor. How does 10 Copper sound?" (Naofumi)<br/>
"…*sigh*. I understand." (Merchant)<br/>
"But as compensation, I’ll give you some publicity. Rafatalia, take the kid and get a bit away." (Naofumi)<br/>
"Understood." (Rafatalia)<br/>
"Eh? Eh?" (Merchant)<br/>
Rafatalia takes the Lumo Child’s hand and leads it away.<br/>
"Eh!?" (Merchant)<br/>
The Merchant raises his voice.<br/>
I take off my robe, and he makes a startled sound.<br/>
"Thanks! You’ve really helped me a lot. I’ll continue to be a regular customer." (Naofumi)<br/>
I say it in quite a monotonous voice.<br/>
But the volume of my voice, and the fact that my face was visible causes the surrounding people to stop in their tracks.<br/>
"Well then, See ya." (Naofumi)<br/>
"W-wait!" (Merchant)<br/>
I hear the sound of people crowding his shop as I walk away.<br/>
"The Hero of the Shield is your regular!?" (Crowd)<br/>
"If that man shopped here, I bet the items will bring luck! Please sell me something." (Another Person)<br/>
"U-um…" (Merchant)<br/>
The Merchant lets out a troubled voice as he deals with all the swarming customers.<br/>
Now then, I should find a safe place to put the robe back on.<br/>
(TL: If you haven’t noticed yet, Lemo is an anagram of mole. If you can think of a better anagram of it, please present it. (The Japanese is Lu-Mo, rearranged to form Mo-Lu))<br/>
