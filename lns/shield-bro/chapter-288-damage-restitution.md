Chapter 288: Damage Restitution<br/>
Uu.. what is this?<br/>
I’m in pain. It feels like I’ve been forced to watch a strange nightmare over and over again. My head is spinning.<br/>
"Naofumi-sama!"<br/>
Raphtalia’s voice returns consciousness to my body, and my eyes open, signaling the end of the dream.<br/>
Before my eyes is Raphtalia, who’s carrying me with a worried expression on her face.<br/>
"This is…?" (Naofumi)<br/>
I look around and find Ren, Itsuki, Rishia, and various others gazing in our direction. We’re in front of what appears to be ruins, near the ocean.<br/>
I think I was supposed to be in Melty’s manor…<br/>
"Raphtalia, where exactly are we? Why have I collapsed… I think I unlocked a curse…" (Naofumi)<br/>
"It’s Naofumi-sama! Right now, the one who’s here is definitely Naofumi-sama!"<br/>
"Hah? What do you mean?" (Naofumi)<br/>
I pick myself up, and I examine my surroundings once more.<br/>
The roar of the sea echoes in my ears, and I can easily understand that I’m not in the village.<br/>
From what I see, it’s the island that makes up Sadina’s secret base… yet still, something’s strange.<br/>
Some sort of structure had collapsed and turned into ruins.<br/>
Is it some sort of plant?<br/>
What I saw next, is a nearby cage containing Firo, Atlas, and Kiel.<br/>
"Why are Firo and the others locked up?" (Naofumi)<br/>
"Do you not remember anything?" (Raphtalia)<br/>
"About what?" (Naofumi)<br/>
"I see… Firo and the others took advantage of a commotion and acted up a bit. They’ll be in there for a while as punishment." (Raphtalia)<br/>
For some reason, those three are looking at me with a sad expression.<br/>
"Rafu~"<br/>
"Wha?" (Naofumi)<br/>
When I look at my feet, I see what seems to be a mix between a small raccoon and a tanuki. A strange monster.<br/>
Its size is around that of a small dog, I guess.<br/>
What could this be?<br/>
"Fake~"<br/>
It lifts its paw at Raphtalia and calls out.<br/>
"Be quiet!" (Raphtalia)<br/>
Even though she rarely gets mad, Raphtalia shouts at the monster and shoos it away.<br/>
Upon hearing her voice, the monster immediately flees.<br/>
What is the meaning of this?<br/>
Hmm?<br/>
Rat is glaring at me angrily.<br/>
Behind her is a tanuki-ish raccoon, larger in size than Firo’s Filo Rial form. It looks like a bigger version of that other monster.<br/>
It has quite a sleepy expression on its face.<br/>
"Raphtalia, what happened here?" (Naofumi)<br/>
"You truly do not remember anything?" (Raphtalia)<br/>
"Yeah." (Naofumi)<br/>
I have a bad premonition as I nod.<br/>
"Let me tell you exactly what happened. Listen carefully." (Raphtalia)<br/>
"Are you really Naofumi?" (Ren)<br/>
Ren comes over and asks me.<br/>
"What’s that supposed to mean… did an impostor of me appear, or something?" (Naofumi)<br/>
"Well… I’m not sure if you could call that an impostor." (Ren)<br/>
Now that I think about it, I feel strangely refreshed.<br/>
It’s a strange feeling, like that I had when fighting the Wrath Dragon.<br/>
… I’m getting a really bad premonition now.<br/>
"Um… Naofumi-sama had his consciousness stolen by a cursed shield. Because of it, he became unable to use the slave crest… though that turned out for the best." (Raphtalia)<br/>
"… I see." (Naofumi)<br/>
I have a vague feeling something like that happened.<br/>
My memory goes up to unlocking some strange series.<br/>
I believe it was the New Seven Deadly Sins.<br/>
"So what exactly did I do?" (Naofumi)<br/>
"What, you ask!?" (Rat)<br/>
Rat angles her eyebrows as she retorts.<br/>
What? What did I do to make Rat this angry?<br/>
"Yeah, please tell me in detail." (Naofumi)<br/>
"Marquis, for some absurd reason, you occupied my laboratory, arbitrarily transferred it to this island, and on top of that, you went around modifying my precious Mii-kun to your whim!" (Rat)<br/>
"Rafu~"<br/>
In response to Rat’s scream, the large… Raccoon?… Behind Rat crys out.<br/>
"Mii-kun was the monster you cared for in the test-tube, right? I modified him?" (Naofumi)<br/>
"Not only that. You preached about how you were going to purify the world, carried out questionable research, and proclaimed you were going to dominate the world." (Rat)<br/>
"What!?" (Naofumi)<br/>
"… Luckily, before you did anything you couldn’t take back, everyone worked together to stop you. It didn’t turn into anything serious." (Rat)<br/>
"I see." (Naofumi)<br/>
"Melty-chan proclaimed that the Hero of the Shield-sama was doing special training for the wave, so he was using unique powers to release monsters. The messengers from Silt Welt also came to our assistance." (Raphtalia)<br/>
Raphtalia explains as she looks at Firo.<br/>
Firo starts shaking in fear as she extends her hand to me.<br/>
"Master… Firo wanted to protect that smile." (Firo)<br/>
"Yes, no matter what happened, we stayed with you until the last moment." (Atlas)<br/>
"It was really fun playing with Niichan." (Kiel)<br/>
The three in the cage let out their opinions.<br/>
Smile? There’s no such thing. Don’t protect it.<br/>
"Master, you talked about Raphtalia-oneechan the whole time." (Firo)<br/>
"Why Raphtalia?" (Naofumi)<br/>
"At the start, you approached me with strange mannerism and invited me to join you in conquest. But after I refused such an offer, you came to the conclusion that I was a fake and ran away." (Raphtalia)<br/>
"Strange mannerism?" (Naofumi)<br/>
"First of all, you used ‘Thy’ and ‘Thou.’" (Raphtalia)<br/>
"That sure is strange." (Naofumi)<br/>
What the hell is ‘Thy’?<br/>
I don’t get what that’s supposed to mean.<br/>
No, the same can be said for all the one’s I’ve seen under the influence of a curse.<br/>
To summarize, I was not an exception. My head turned strange.<br/>
"Next, it was something about how the world was rotten. About how before the wave did its work, you would purge it. You asked for my cooperation as well." (Taniko)<br/>
From the sky, Taniko comes aboard Gaelion. She gets off and says as such.<br/>
"And after taking that old lady’s laboratory, you took all the monsters with you as well. You carried off quite a few of the village children while you were at it." (Taniko)<br/>
"Is there no end to this?" (Naofumi)<br/>
"Firo, Atlas-chan, and Kiel-kun rode the wave and followed you. Next, you erected a huge Bioplant castle on top of Sadina-neesan’s house. I believe you called it the Castle Plant." (Raphtalia)<br/>
Wow… what exactly was the cursed me thinking?<br/>
Could it be that I directly acted out my various dark feelings against this world’s nobility…?<br/>
I must’ve been an unreasonable fellow.<br/>
Though there are some personal matters mixed in with these complaints.<br/>
"By the way, how much time did we waste taking me down?" (Naofumi)<br/>
"A little over a week."<br/>
"What was that!?" (Naofumi)<br/>
Wait a second, it’s already been more than a week!?<br/>
I use status magic to view the countdown to the next wave.<br/>
Uwah!<br/>
It’s true. There’s only a week and a half left.<br/>
"… I performed human experimentation on that group?" (Naofumi)<br/>
"Yes. Kiel-kun." (Raphtalia)<br/>
Raphtalia stares at Kiel, and she curls her tail into a ball in fear.<br/>
But sensing her intent, Kiel changes her form.<br/>
… It’s a small puppy with three heads. Cerberus?<br/>
But since Kiel is the base, I get more of a Kielberus impression from it.<br/>
"Eh?"<br/>
"When I begged him for it, Niichan happily did it for me." (Kiel)<br/>
"No matter how strange I was, that’s going too far." (Naofumi)<br/>
It’s human modification, you know… Though she can turn back.<br/>
Did the cursed me plan to make her a disposable pawn?<br/>
"Niichan, your choice of words was strange, but you constantly worried about me, and you never hurt me. You made whatever changes that weren’t too dangerous for me!" (Kiel)<br/>
With a regretful expression, Kiel begins letting out tears.<br/>
She truly adored that person, but though it was me, it wasn’t me. I have no memory of it.<br/>
It feels like she’s complimenting a stranger.<br/>
"That person, while being Naofumi-sama, wasn’t Naofumi-sama!" (Raphtalia)<br/>
Raphtalia cries out, and Kiel shuts up.<br/>
"Firo, you see, was given the ability to fly by Master." (Firo)<br/>
"What…?" (Naofumi)<br/>
In the cage, human form Firo bats her wings. Something glitters, and she begins floating.<br/>
She’s really flying…<br/>
But how would she lift off her normally huge body?<br/>
She seems built to run on the ground. It’s unsettling to imagine her flying around in the sky.<br/>
"FUOOOOOH! Firo-tan!" (Motoyasu)<br/>
Motoyasu assaults the cage with his overwhelming emotions.<br/>
"Mu! Go away!" (Firo)<br/>
With an extremely unpleasant face, Firo rejects him. Atlas thrusts at Motoyasu and drives him away.<br/>
"What about you, Atlas?" (Naofumi)<br/>
"You told me that it was no good… that I couldn’t be modified." (Atlas)<br/>
"I see." (Naofumi)<br/>
For Firo and Kiel to have been experimented on to this extent… I turn my head towards Raphtalia, while a bad feeling fills my stomach.<br/>
"What about the others?" (Naofumi)<br/>
"… The slaves undergoing treatment in the lab all became your test subjects, and…" (Raphtalia)<br/>
NOOOOOOOOOOOOO!<br/>
I did something I can never take back.<br/>
There’s no way I ever planned on doing anything this inhuman.<br/>
"They all underwent complete recoveries. After that, you modified them as per their own request, and they rushed into battle against us." (Raphtalia)<br/>
"… What?" (Naofumi)<br/>
"At the moment, like Firo’s group, they are under our protection." (Raphtalia)<br/>
"Ah, I see." (Naofumi)<br/>
Per their own request… what exactly happened?<br/>
"Your charisma while under that curse was amazing. Everyone desperately tried to protect you." (Ren)<br/>
"… That’s right. For some reason, Naofumi-san is always the target of everyone’s affections." (Itsuki)<br/>
Ren and Itsuki answer.<br/>
Itsuki is expressionless, but I feel that he’s healing in a different direction from the past Itsuki.<br/>
Now that I think about it, since a week’s passed, has his curse healed to some extent?<br/>
"Itsuki-sama." (Rishia)<br/>
"It’s alright. The current me can understand that they moved for Naofumi-san’s form of justice." (Itsuki)<br/>
"Ah, also, there’s something that’s been bothering me for a while." (Naofumi)<br/>
What exactly are those Raccoon-Tanuki hybrid monsters staring at us from the shadows of the ruins?<br/>
They all seem slightly different, and there are a couple of distinct varieties.<br/>
But without fail, each and every one of them looks like some sort of mix between a Raccoon, Red Panda, and Tanuki. Some of their parts seem vaguely familiar.<br/>
I point my finger at them.<br/>
"They’re the last remaining traces of the monsters that chose to follow you, mixed with a completely new race of monster you created, of course. They’re the first generation Raph race." (Rat)<br/>
"Say what!?" (Naofumi)<br/>
Eh? Those are the monsters from my place!?<br/>
"Yeah. Everyone turned out like that, and they came to pick a fight with us." (Taniko)<br/>
Taniko speaks with an irritated expression.<br/>
She definitely holds a grudge!<br/>
But she did hold the monsters quite close to her heart. I can’t really complain.<br/>
"And, like, why do they look like that?" (Naofumi)<br/>
There’s a bit of resemblance with Raphtalia’s tail and ears.<br/>
Their cries also sound something like: ‘Rafu~’ and ‘Tari~’ and ‘Ri~ya~’. Connecting them gives a certain name.<br/>
Each and every one of them seems to have a conditioned reflex where if they see Raphtalia, they raise their arms and…<br/>
"Fake~"<br/>
Call out those words.<br/>
When I ask that, Sadina comes over, waving her hand. She gives a muffled laugh.<br/>
… Why is she brown? She’s also become relatively fluffy.<br/>
"After Raphtalia-chan rejected Naofumi-chan, you came under the impression that there was no way Raphtalia-chan would betray you. You started calling her a fake and started using her hair to try and revive the real Raphtalia-chan." (Sadina)<br/>
"Why!?" (Naofumi)<br/>
"Even I can’t tell you that one. After my spying was exposed, you made me look like this." (Sadina)<br/>
"Are you alright?" (Naofumi)<br/>
"According to Rat-chan, it’s fixable. I’ll be fine." (Sadina)<br/>
Muu… what exactly was the other me thinking?<br/>
"And, in the end, what are we going to do with those monsters?" (Naofumi)<br/>
"They themselves wished for those forms, so… can’t we just introduce them to the world as new races?" (Rat)<br/>
Rat replies with a defeated expression.<br/>
"By the way, the strange Marquis named them Raph race, Tali race, Rafuta race, Riya Race, and Talia race, or something like that, it seems." (Rat)<br/>
I truly can’t understand what that guy–me–was thinking!<br/>
What exactly was he planning on doing by making these strange life forms?<br/>
"Wait a second, you called those the first generation, right? Is there a second?" (Naofumi)<br/>
"Of course there is. It goes all the way up to seven. You remade a new generation every day, Marquis. What’s more, you made battle models, final weapon models, and some other specialized ones. They got closer and closer in appearance to Raphtalia-san, and it got harder for us to fight them." (Rat)<br/>
Taniko presents a specimen to me.<br/>
"Rafu~"<br/>
"This is the seventh generation." (Taniko)<br/>
An SD Raphtalia-esque lifeform greets me.<br/>
(TL: SD is super deformed. It’s an art style, pretty much the one you may recognize as chibi, with large head and small body.)<br/>
(ED: I really hate the word super-deformed :( It sounds so nasty. Why couldn’t we just leave it as chibi orz)<br/>
<br/>
(TL: This is the original author’s sketch of child Raphtalia. I guess you could call it a SD Raphtalia, but SD is to an even greater extent.)<br/>
(ED: OMG LOLI RAPHTALIA)<br/>
If I change my viewpoint, I guess she looks a little like Raphtalia when she was small.<br/>
But even in this form, all she says is Rafu~.<br/>
"I don’t know what became of the eighth generation. There may be one exactly like the original walking around." (Rat)<br/>
Uwah… That would be quite a development.<br/>
When I put my hands on my hanged head, Raphtalia places her hand on my shoulder.<br/>
"Naofumi-sama." (Raphtalia)<br/>
"W-what?" (Naofumi)<br/>
"What happens after we overcome the wave?" (Raphtalia)<br/>
"I go home?" (Naofumi)<br/>
"… Yes." (Raphtalia)<br/>
Raphtalia puts on a sweet smile and nods.<br/>
"It’s alright. Though we had a late start, we can still get back on track. Let’s work hard together." (Raphtalia)<br/>
"That’s right… GUHA!" (Naofumi)<br/>
I vomit blood all of a sudden.<br/>
"W-what is this!?" (Naofumi)<br/>
"I bet it’s the curse." (Ren)<br/>
Ren scratches his head as he mutters this.<br/>
Curse?<br/>
"You used your newly found intelligence to modify everyone using the minimum amount of your abilities, but it seems there’s still a bit of an after-effect." (Ren)<br/>
Well, yeah…<br/>
Looking at Firo, Kiel, the Raph Race, and all the others I modified, I am aware that I must have done a lot.<br/>
I look at my status to find that my wounds are not healing. It’s a very minor curse.<br/>
I think I can just cover this one with medicine.<br/>
Next is… my EP isn’t recovering either. I can recover it through normal means, though.<br/>
I also found this out later. In daily intervals, the EXP that I got was taken away. The taken EXP went towards feeding the new Raph Race.<br/>
If I just fight, I can make up for it.<br/>
There may be more, but at present, these are the curses I’ve identified.<br/>
"Though you yourself, when under that curse, was quite weak." (Ren)<br/>
"Is that so?" (Naofumi)<br/>
"Yes. Your defense was fatally low, and you didn’t strengthen that shield." (Ren)<br/>
Muu. In the end, that may have saved me.<br/>
"Anyways… the one who’s going to be compensating for all the damage done in this incident is me, right?" (Naofumi)<br/>
"Yup."<br/>
Ah… I feel that I’m going to be losing all the fortune I reaped in the festival. I may even go into debt.<br/>
"Luckily, a portion of the research the strange Naofumi-sama conducted was picked up by Rat." (Raphtalia)<br/>
"It was full of things I wanted to do. With this, my own research should take great leaps. Though I feel a bit regretful for using it." (Rat)<br/>
"Rafu~"<br/>
Mii-kun… was it?… puts Rat on his shoulders and begins walking off.<br/>
"If you didn’t lend this child power, I still think he would have fought. You gave him a first generation Raph body, but he begged you for further strength, so you made him a special ‘Final Weapon’ body." (Rat)<br/>
"I see… didn’t you want his body to function on the same system as Dragon cores? Something about versatility?" (Naofumi)<br/>
"It appears that you already did that." (Rat)<br/>
"Oh, really…" (Naofumi)<br/>
"He was the lead actor in the end. If he didn’t turncoat in the end, I think we would still be fighting him right now." (Ren)<br/>
Ren supplements some information.<br/>
Ah, for the love of… What exactly was I doing!?<br/>
… Mii-kun, was it?<br/>
The word of his betrayal irritates me.<br/>
In Sadina’s case, she stood by as Raphtalia’s ally and worked with her to stop me. Looking at the wider picture, I can’t really call that betrayal, and if I was in her position, I would have done the same.<br/>
And if I did regain sanity for a brief moment, that would be what I would request.<br/>
However this one made use of my insanity to strengthen himself.<br/>
From the start, he was an ally of Rat and no friend to me. It’s understandable, but unsatisfying.<br/>
"Rafu~"<br/>
What?<br/>
Mii-kun starts Rafu-ing in Rat’s ear.<br/>
"Eh? What? He made you a test subject, and asked for experimental consent, but never asked you to swear loyalty?" (Rat)<br/>
"…" (Naofumi)<br/>
What sophism.<br/>
Does that mean that if I had asked him to swear loyalty beforehand, he would have refused?<br/>
It’s the same sophism that I use every day.<br/>
Since I was the one at fault this time, I can’t complain. But still, how irritating.<br/>
To summarize, he wasn’t an ally from the start, so it wasn’t betrayal.<br/>
Because betrayal means to fool those who you think of as allies.<br/>
I just went and modified him, so he just quietly withstood it, is probably what he’ll try and argue.<br/>
I have no memories of the incident, but based on their testimonies, I was the cliché villain, and Raphtalia the main hero.<br/>
That truly does seem to be the case.<br/>
Don’t they appear a lot in fiction? Boss characters that get betrayed and attacked by their subordinates?<br/>
In Manga, after betraying the antagonist, the protagonists would welcome them onto their side.<br/>
It’s not like I hate characters like that.<br/>
In literary production, that is.<br/>
When you’re on the affected side, it feels quite unpleasant.<br/>
How disgusting.<br/>
Though that wasn’t me.<br/>
Ah, right. I think Rat told me before that he was greedy for power.<br/>
It was the other me’s fault for not understanding his personality.<br/>
But… I guess I just don’t like him on a personal level.<br/>
I think I’ll be ignoring him from here on out.<br/>
"Rat-san appears to be angry at Naofumi-sama, but she’s truly quite thankful." (Raphtalia)<br/>
"I see. I hope all’s well that ends well, but…" (Naofumi)<br/>
… I’m going to unload a few things.<br/>
It seems I went too far in various things.<br/>
Just modifying the Bioplant and displaying avarice was enough to awaken a curse series?<br/>
By the way, the current me cannot even bring up the New Seven Deadly Sins Shield. I can’t even remember what sort of shield it was.<br/>
And like this, the curtain closes on my recklessness.<br/>
"By the way, where’s Fohl?" (Naofumi)<br/>
"ANEKI!" (Fohl)<br/>
From a distance, Fohl runs towards Raphtalia.<br/>
Aneki? (TL: Older sister, occasionally female leader)<br/>
"Did it go well?" (Fohl)<br/>
"Yes. Because Fohl-kun was able to stall the collapse…"<br/>
"The moments afterwards were quite hectic. The castle started crumbling on us all. But we were able to guide and evacuate everyone."<br/>
When Fohl notices me, he starts glaring at me.<br/>
"Aneki? Did you start calling her that during the journey?" (Naofumi)<br/>
"No, during the current incident. When Atlas-chan went to Naofumi-sama’s side, Fohl-kun reluctantly followed her and became your subordinate. I… encouraged him, and brought him over to our camp." (Raphtalia)<br/>
"Yes, Aneki told me this. If you truly cherish your little sister, then as a big brother, you shouldn’t pamper her so!" (Fohl)<br/>
"I see…" (Naofumi)<br/>
How should I say this. It seems that quite a soap opera played out when I wasn’t looking.<br/>
The rebellious Fohl now is this obedient to Raphtalia.<br/>
Will they marry when they grow up? I don’t approve of it, by the way.<br/>
"… Naofumi-sama? Are you thinking something sinister right now?" (Raphtalia)<br/>
"About what?" (Naofumi)<br/>
"No, there’s no problem, but…" (Raphtalia)<br/>
"My eyes were blinded. I was pulled around by the selfishness of my sister, who recently started getting better. However, love must also be strict. That’s what Raphtalia-aneki taught me." (Fohl)<br/>
"Ah, I see…" (Naofumi)<br/>
He clenches his fist tightly. It was something I warned him about daily, but he was afraid of incurring his sister’s hate. I mean, Atlas even occasionally says she will curse him one day.<br/>
"It’s all your fault!" (Fohl)<br/>
"Yeah, that’s fine…" (Naofumi)<br/>
I mean, it’s true. I feel kinda tired.<br/>
"I definitely don’t approve of you, you know!" (Fohl)<br/>
"Ah, yes, yes." (Naofumi)<br/>
Anyways, it seems Fohl became Raphtalia’s younger brother (Follower).<br/>
… But I think her real age is lower than his.<br/>
