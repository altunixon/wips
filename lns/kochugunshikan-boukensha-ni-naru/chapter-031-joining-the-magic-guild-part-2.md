"Can I ask how you came up with these prices?"<br/>
"The spells which a greater number of people can cast costs cheaper, while the ones with a small number of users come at a higher price.<br/>
Basically, it’s based on the number of people who can use said spells. The ratio is more or less proportionate to the price of the corresponding magic tome. In other words, spells from cheaper magic tomes have a greater number of users, while spells from the more expensive ones have lesser.<br/>
But we can also factor in a particular preference regarding a certain spell regardless of the cost, so the trend isn’t absolute.<br/>
And people who can afford the more expensive spells are generally those with lots of money to spare. They won’t trouble themselves with fulfilling your request if there isn’t an appropriate compensation."<br/>
"I see. So that’s the case. Which of the spells in this list can you show me immediately? Oh, and when I say ‘immediately’, I don’t really mean you’ll have to show me the spells right now. It’s fine if it’s within these next few days."<br/>
"Let’s see… This one, this one, this one, this one, this one, and this one."<br/>
Cara-san took the list from me and circled some spell names on the list with her pen.<br/>
-Water Magic<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Water Ball: 500 Guineas<br/>
-Light Magic<br/>
Light: 500 Guineas<br/>
Light Ball: 500 Guineas<br/>
Light Arrow: 950 Guineas<br/>
Light Wall: 950 Guineas<br/>
Heal: 1000 Guineas<br/>
"That’s unexpectedly few."<br/>
"Yes, unfortunately.<br/>
Alan-san can already cast Fire Ball, Flame Arrow, and Wind Cutter, I’ve been told. These spells are some of the most popular.<br/>
They are comparatively easier to learn as well.<br/>
About half of our Guild members have learned these spells as well. So, in a branch with a limited number of members registered, these are all we can offer at the moment."<br/>
"I see. I understand."<br/>
Come to think of it, the spell Water Ball is like the water-based version of the Fire Ball spell. I think I’ll be able to cast it even without the help of anyone else after a bit of practice.<br/>
So, within the spells indicated, the only thing I don’t think I’ll be able to handle is the Heal spell.<br/>
It seems pointless to pay 500 Guineas to see spells I would be able to work out on my own after all.<br/>
"I’ll be canceling the request for these particular spells then."<br/>
I borrowed her pen from Cara-san and crossed out a number of spells on the list<br/>
"Tch."<br/>
Eh!? Did this person just click her tongue? I raised my face and locked eyes with Cara-san.<br/>
"What is it, sir?"<br/>
"No, nothing."<br/>
What I saw was a composed expression that didn’t have a trace of someone who clicked her tongue in annoyance.<br/>
(She did click her tongue earlier, right?)<br/>
「Affirmative.」<br/>
Oh boy. It looks like I really can’t judge a book by its cover.<br/>
I also crossed out the spells on the list I felt I could puzzle out on my own apart from the ones marked with a circle. I ended up crossing out about two-thirds of all the spells on the list.<br/>
"I’m sorry about canceling for some of them, but the price is a bit steep, so I’ll have to consider my budget, you see. I hope you don’t mind."<br/>
"No, please don’t mind, sir. I can demonstrate Heal for you in a few days, but as for the other spells, we’ll work on them once a Guild member who can cast them becomes available. Would that be fine, sir?"<br/>
"About that, we’re actually not permanent residents of this city but are in the middle of our travels. I think we’ll be able to stay in this city for a month more, but that would depend on the situation. Please consider this point."<br/>
Most likely, we’ll get some sort of reply from the request we placed at the Adventurer’s Guild within a month at most.<br/>
"If that’s the case, we’ll contact you immediately once a Guild member becomes available so we can work on your request on the spot. Well, I’ll be handling ten percent of the listed spells though."<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
"Yeah, that arrangement’s good."<br/>
"What about the matter of registering as Guild members? Lily did mention you’ll be getting a twenty percent discount, correct? Are you going through with it?"<br/>
"I’ve thought about it, but I guess we’ll hold off on becoming members first."<br/>
Since we’ll only get to see Heal this time, we wouldn’t be able to make up for the cost of the sign-up fees for all three of us.<br/>
"I see. How unfortunate."<br/>
She wasn’t putting on a polite display. It seems Cara-san really thought it was a pity.<br/>
"I also want to ask about magic tools. Would that be okay?"<br/>
"Of course. What do you want to know, specifically?"<br/>
"I’m interested in getting to know the types of magic tools currently available. Do you have some relevant documents regarding this available?"<br/>
"We do. Lily-!"<br/>
Lily walked back to the reception counter and took out a piece of paper.<br/>
She then went back to the table and handed it to me. The contents were a list of magic tools along with simple descriptions about their functions. It was sort of like a catalog.<br/>
Flame producing magic tool, refrigerating magic tool, light-emitting magic tool… There were several kinds of magic tools listed out. It looks like there wasn’t a magic tool akin to a mixer yet.<br/>
"By the way, how much would it cost if I were to place an order for the manufacture of a certain magic tool?"<br/>
"It would depend greatly on the specific function of the tool in question. What kind of magic tool are you thinking of requesting?"<br/>
"Um, I’m a cook and find it hard to mix stuff by hand, so I was wondering it’s possible to use a magic tool to make mixing ingredients easier. It would greatly ease the burden if a magic tool was used, I think."<br/>
"Cooking, is it? This is the first time I’ve encountered such a proposition. So it would mainly be a tool for mixing fluid substances, correct?"<br/>
"Yes, that’s right. Like eggs, oil, and stuff for example."<br/>
"The development costs along with the manufacturing fee would amount to about 60,000 Guineas by my estimate."<br/>
"It’ll cost that much!?"<br/>
"Yes. In the case of an entirely new concept of magic tool, we’ll have to create several prototypes and test them out before we can produce a completed product after all. This is a necessary step in the process."<br/>
"I see. That’s unfortunate then."<br/>
If developing a mixer would cost me 60,000 Guineas, I think it would be better if I continued doing it by hand.<br/>
"The costs would be cheaper if you make them yourself, of course."<br/>
"Eh!? You can develop magic tools privately?"<br/>
"Well, I meant it as a joke, but it’s technically possible to personally develop a magic tool."<br/>
"You mean you can teach me how to make magic tools here?"<br/>
"We can; if you become a Guild member that is. We’ll still be charging a fee of course."<br/>
"And how much would that be?"<br/>
"A basic magic tool manufacturing short course would be 50,000 Guineas. This goes without mentioning, but it’s not like you’ll be able to successfully develop the magic tool you want once you undergo the course. But it’s theoretically possible."<br/>
I’m not particularly fixed on getting a mixer anyway. But I’m interested in the basic workings of a magic tool though. 50,000 Guineas is expensive, but I guess I’ll take the plunge!<br/>
"Ria, I’m…"<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
"You don’t have to worry about the money, Alan. You want to do it, right? There’s no problem since we’re going to stay at the inn for free from now on. Do as you please Alan."<br/>
"I see. Thank you, Ria."<br/>
"Okay then. I’ll avail the short course please."<br/>
"Alan-san will be the only one taking part, correct? Well then, please pay the 500 Guinea registration fee at the counter and take the qualification exam, please. Would this be fine?"<br/>
"Alright."<br/>
I paid five silvers and received a copy of the Guild rules from Lily. It looks like they won’t explain it in detail personally, unlike the Adventurer’s Guild.<br/>
"Well then, please follow us to the exam hall."<br/>
Once I agreed to take the Guild member qualification exam, Cara-san remained all smiles.<br/>
Cara-san guided the three of us to the exam venue. The exam hall was the same one used by the Adventurer’s Guild. It looks like the two Guilds were sharing the use of the building.<br/>
We went inside the Adventurer’s Guild building first, and Cara-san talked about something with the staff. She then led us back to the exam hall.<br/>
"Alright then, please demonstrate every spell you can cast to me, Alan-san."<br/>
It looks like this time’s exam is similar to the magic portion of the adventurer qualification exam we took a few days back.<br/>
