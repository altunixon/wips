      <p>Today, the Genos Post Station Town was in an uproar since morning.</p>

      <p>The reason was obvious. The Forest’s Edge denizen Asuta was abducted yesterday.</p>

      <p>Yumi learned of this news while she was helping out at her family’s inn. She thought it was an unfunny joke at first, but her mind was then filled with rage and sadness, which made her dull-witted. Even so, she still got in contact with her besties in town and scoured the town until the sunset. But she couldn’t find Asuta.</p>

      <p>One night has passed, but she still couldn’t calm down. Before realizing it, she was instructed to serve lunch to customers and had been standing in a daze inside the kitchen all the while. But a fire that was as strong as a brazier burned in her heart.</p>

      <p>Yumi’s family operated an inn called the 《West Wind Inn》. It was an old budget inn where the delinquents and the poor frequented. The place wasn’t big, but quite a number of guest lodged here. Yumi grilled meat and vegetables for these customers as she planned on her action for the day.</p>

      <p>“Sigh, things have been hectic in town; just buying some groceries is such a pain.”</p>

      <p>Her mother returned with a large sack.</p>

      <p>“Hectic? You mean the search for the culprit who abducted Asuta?”</p>

      <p>Yumi asked immediately, and her mother shook her head as she placed the sack on the table:</p>

      <p>“No, it’s the denizens of Forest’s Edge coming to town one after another. The guards ran to them in a panic when they saw them, and it caused quite a commotion.”</p>

      <p>“Are the denizens of Forest’s Edge trying to enter the city?”</p>

      <p>“No, they seemed to be here to search for their tribemate. If they try to enter the city, they will definitely get into a fight with the guards.”</p>

      <p>Yumi sighed in relief and answered: “Is that so.”</p>

      <p>There seemed to be some conflict between the denizens of Forest’s Edge and the nobles in the city. Asuta was kidnapped at a time like this, so it wouldn’t be strange that they felt this was the doing of the nobles. But it was against the law to enter the city without an entry pass. Yumi was relieved that the denizens of Forest’s Edge didn’t do that.</p>

      <p>“I bought the fuwano. After setting up the hotpot, I will leave this to you too.”</p>

      <p>“Ehh? There’s something I have to do later.”</p>

      <p>“What is it? There are guards and denizens of Forest’s Edge everywhere; you can’t go out during a time like this.”</p>

      <p>“But, I can’t just leave Asuta alone!”</p>

      <p>Yumi retorted, and her mother looked at her worriedly:</p>

      <p>“This can’t be helped. If the culprit really is a noble, no one can judge them. It’s a pity; I will never forget the denizens of Forest’s Edge and the kiba dishes.”</p>

      <p>“Why!? Mother, you think Asuta’s kiba is delicious too, right!?”</p>

      <p>Yumi was trying to persuade her parents to sell kiba dishes in the 《West Wind Inn》.</p>

      <p>Yumi’s mother who ate the kiba cooking together with her had no objections. The one against it was her father. But Yumi didn’t give up, and her father was finally willing to meet Asuta. But this commotion poured all her efforts down the drain.</p>

      <p>“But, we can’t defy the nobles. If the people in the city set their sights on us, our small inn will get torn down.”</p>

      <p>“That’s impossible! Are you saying the nobles can do whatever they want!?”</p>

      <p>“Only a noble can sentence a noble. We can’t do anything.”</p>

      <p>Yumi became filled with rage and hit the floor with the firewood in her hand.</p>

      <p>“I will never give up! How can I allow the nobles to abduct Asuta!?”</p>

      <p>“Ah, Yumi, wait…”</p>

      <p>“The pot is boiling! Mum, go cook the fuwano!”</p>

      <p>Yumi yelled as she dashed out of the kitchen. She headed right for the door and went out onto the streets. This was the notorious slums of the Post Station Town, even the guards wouldn’t venture here. But to Yumi who grew up here, this was like her backyard.</p>

      <p>Genos was a prosperous city. To outsiders, there were few cities in the west that could match it in wealth. However, all the wealth was concentrated inside the city, and people starving to death inside the slums were not uncommon.</p>

      <p>The city was protected by rock walls taller than a house, and the inside and outside of the wall were worlds apart. Yumi wouldn’t ever have the chance to enter the city, and the nobles in the city would never set foot in the slums. For those dwelling in the slums, the aristocrats were like clouds in the sky.</p>

      <p><i>But even so, I won’t permit this.</i></p>

      <p>Yumi thought as she ran through the streets.</p>

      <p>This was the main street passing right through the middle of the Post Station Town. Big houses and shops could be seen everywhere, and many people had gathered here so early in the morning. The business ran by the people here brought quite a substantial amount of wealth to Genos.</p>

      <p>However, things were different today. Like what her mother said, there was a dangerous air here. Plenty of guards were around this street, and she could see many denizens of Forest’s Edge wearing kiba capes.</p>

      <p>There wasn’t any confrontation yet, but the atmosphere was tense. Innocent merchants and travelers afraid of being caught in between them quickly walked away with their head low.</p>

      <p><i>… This… is just like that time.</i></p>

      <p>That time when the great villain of Forest’s Edge caused an uproar in the Post Station Town.</p>

      <p>There was an uneasy air in the town back then too. It continued to linger until the great villain redeemed for his crime with his life.</p>

      <p><i>Damn it! Thanks to Asuta, the atmosphere had gotten so much better…</i></p>

      <p>Yumi grit her teeth as a familiar face walked over from the other side of the street. He was the son of a family running a bar, and one of her besties.</p>

      <p>“Yo, what took you so long? Your Dad stopped you?”</p>

      <p>“After I got in a big fight with my Dad in the morning, we didn’t talk at all. What’s up in town…?”</p>

      <p>“Nothing much. As you can see, the guards and the denizens of Forest’s Edge are on edge, but things are much calmer than earlier.”</p>

      <p>“Is that so. What about Asuta’s kidnappers…? Any clues?”</p>

      <p>“I visited a few taverns but didn’t see any suspicious characters. If he was taken away by the nobles… Shouldn’t he be in the rock walls?”</p>

      <p>Yumi stamped her feet: “Damn it!”</p>

      <p>“Is there any way to get inside the rock walls? Do you know any businessman inside the city?”</p>

      <p>“Why would people from prim and proper shops be associated with someone like me? You want to climb the wall? You will get stabbed by the lances.”</p>

      <p>Yumi bit her lips and looked at the streets. The place was rowdy unlike the slums, but those doing business here were just commoners. They wouldn’t dare defy the guards, much lest the nobles.</p>

      <p>However, there seemed to be an incident between the townsfolk of the Post Station Town and the guards yesterday. The vegetable stall owner and innkeeper Asuta knew very well went to the guard house and said they knew who abducted Asuta.</p>

      <p>Thanks to them, the culprits were put on wanted posters right away. The innkeeper from the 《Cryptic Venerable Inn》 who was with Asuta back then saw how the criminals looked like. Yumi searched until nightfall with the wanted poster… but failed to obtain any lead.</p>

      <p>Her bestie looked at Yumi who was trembling with regret:</p>

      <p>“Erm, anyway, let’s grab a bite first. I had been working since morning, I’m famished.”</p>

      <p>“Ah, then go eat something. I don’t feel like eating.”</p>

      <p>“Are you alright? You will miss out of the kiba dishes if you dally too much.”</p>

      <p>Yumi glared unconsciously at him.</p>

      <p>“Asuta isn’t here, so why even mention kiba dishes? Are you drunk so early?”</p>

      <p>“Don’t look at me with such scary eyes. The denizens of Forest’s Edge are still running the stall without Asuta.”</p>

      <p>Yumi was shocked.</p>

      <p>She felt something similar to charcoal fire burning in her chest.</p>

      <p>“They still have the luxury of running the stalls? Is money more important than Asuta?”</p>

      <p>“I don’t know that. Go ask them yourself.”</p>

      <p>“…Got it. Let’s go and ask.”</p>

      <p>Yumi headed north. The marketplace was to the north of the main street, and the stalls were located in the northern end.</p>

      <p>On her way there, she didn’t run into any denizens of Forest’s Edge. Many of the hunters were here, but their numbers were just a few dozens. Their apparent lack of concern for Asuta made her feel really mad.</p>

      <p>A short while later, she saw a crowd before her.</p>

      <p>Business was booming as usual, with most of the customers from Jaguar or Semu. Twenty percent of the people were from Selva, so the ratio remained the same.</p>

      <p>Yumi suppressed her boiling emotions and queued up with her bestie.</p>

      <p>“Welcome, that will be two copper plates.”</p>

      <p>When it was Yumi’s turn, the girl tending to the stall greeted her.</p>

      <p>“Hey, you…”</p>

      <p>Yumi said with a scary voice halfway before she held her breath.</p>

      <p>At the stall were Vena Wu and a raven-haired girl who came to change shifts. She didn’t look like Vena Wu, even though she was Vena Wu’s sister. That girl looked really young, but her features were proportionate. She was putting on a smile, but her eyes were red and swollen from crying.</p>

      <p>“Ahh… You are the daughter of an inn that patronizes us regularly, right? Thank you very much for your continued support.”</p>

      <p>“Huh? Ah, yes…”</p>

      <p>“Could I make them one at a time for you? It will be done soon.”</p>

      <p>That girl said as she made the 『Kiba burger』 nimbly.</p>

      <p>Yumi took the hamburger, paid the money, and then stood beside the stall.</p>

      <p>“Erm, why are you still running the stalls?”</p>

      <p>“Huh?”</p>

      <p>That girl looked at Yumi quizzingly.</p>

      <p>However, the next customer paid her copper plates, so she couldn’t answer Yumi. A red-headed girl from the other stall strolled over. She had been helping out at the stall since a long time ago and was called Lala Wu. She was also Vena Wu’s younger sister.</p>

      <p>“Leina-nee, I will take over your shift. It must be tiring for you to search in town, right?”</p>

      <p>“Yes, thank you. I will leave this to you then.”</p>

      <p>The dark-haired girl named Leina switched places with her sister and then walked to Yumi. She was a member of the Wu clan, so her full name should be Leina Wu. Leina Wu bowed at Yumi.</p>

      <p>“Sorry for the commotion in town. We have no intentions of antagonizing the townsfolk, please believe us.”</p>

      <p>“Ah, yes. I’m not doubting you… But Asuta had already been abducted, so why are you still continuing with the business?”</p>

      <p>“I don’t think we should let the relationship Asuta built up crumble. Before Asuta returns, we, the Wu clan, hope to maintain the bonds we have built with the townsfolk.”</p>

      <p><i>Before Asuta returns…</i>The incredible warmth of these words entered Yumi’s heart.</p>

      <p>“Is that so; you have not given up on Asuta. I thought…”</p>

      <p>Leina Wu said in a firm tone: “Asuta will definitely be back. Asuta has made it through many difficulties in the past too.”</p>

      <p>There was a strong gleam in her puffy eyes. No matter how young she was, this girl was still a denizen of Forest’s Edge. Yumi didn’t completely understand their sense of values yet.</p>

      <p>“We will join in the search for Asuta after the stall closes. We need to prepare for tomorrow’s work, so we don’t have much time… But we want to do our part too.”</p>

      <p>“Yes, I understand. I will look around town too. I also want to find Asuta.”</p>

      <p>Leina Wu then smiled brilliantly.</p>

      <p>“So you are helping too. As a denizen of Forest’s Edge, I want to thank you.”</p>

      <p>“I want to thank you too.”</p>

      <p>With that, Yumi bit the 『Kiba burger』 in her hand.</p>

      <p>“Hmm, it’s good! It’s as good as the one Asuta made.”</p>

      <p>“Thank you very much. But… the Wu clan has been the one making the 『Kiba burger』 for quite some time now.”</p>

      <p>“Huh, is that so!?”</p>

      <p>“Yes, but we need Asuta’s help to make 『Myam-roasted meat』, so both stalls are selling 『Kiba burger』 for today.”</p>

      <p>“I see, that’s amazing! There won’t be any problems with the business then.”</p>

      <p>“Yes. Even though an incident happened again, the number of customers isn’t falling at all. This is thanks to Asuta breaking tradition of the Forest’s Edge about not building relationship with the people in town…”</p>

      <p>The cloud of agitation in Yumi’s heart was gone. Now that she thought about it, a tribe as honest and simple as the denizens of Forest’s Edge would never abandon Asuta who was their tribemate. Yumi felt ashamed of her stupidity.</p>

      <p>“Please work hard! Do tell me if you find any clues!”</p>

      <p>“Yes, thank you very much.”</p>

      <p>Yumi waved at Leina Wu and went back with her bestie.</p>

      <p>Her bestie who was eating a 『Kiba burger』 quietly all the while sighed:</p>

      <p>“The women of Forest’s Edge are all beauties. I almost lost myself after looking at that smile.”</p>

      <p>“Hey, stop looking at the denizens of Forest’s Edge with eyes like that!”</p>

      <p>“What are you saying, Yumi? You are looking at Asuta with eyes like that too!”</p>

      <p>“That’s nonsense! I’m not!”</p>

      <p>Yumi suddenly kicked the butt of her bestie.</p>

      <p>“In any case, let’s help too! Not just the inns, we will scour every corner where the culprits might be hiding!”</p>

      <p>“That hurts… There’re already people taking care of that; the Post Station Town is really big, you know? It can’t be done in just a day or two.”</p>

      <p>“Then we will just have to spend three to four days! Stop wasting time grumbling!”</p>

      <p>“I’m not griping. I don’t want to leave Asuta in a pinch either.”</p>

      <p>With that, her bestie popped the rest of his 『Kiba burger』 into his mouth.</p>

      <p>Her bestie used to loathe the denizens of Forest’s Edge. When Asuta first started his business in the Post Station Town, Yumi and he went to stir trouble at Asuta’s stall.</p>

      <p>Before realizing it, they already became regulars at Asuta’s stall and were running around town for Asuta’s sake. That was the effect of the bonds Asuta erected with the townsfolk.</p>

      <p><i>I won’t let his stall go broke because of this.</i></p>

      <p>Yumi perked herself up, and her bestie who was walking with her grunted.</p>

      <p>“Someone is already walking along this street. Let’s meet up with them first. Yumi, want to take a look at the ‘Drunkard’s alley’?”</p>

      <p>“Ah, it will be dangerous for non-locals to go there.”</p>

      <p>‘Drunkard’s alley’ was a street in the deepest part of the slums. Yumi and her besties had to muster their courage before heading in there.</p>

      <p>“But Yumi, will you be fine alone? Do you need to call more guys?”</p>

      <p>“We will be marked if we get too many people. I’m the quickest in running, so don’t worry.”</p>

      <p>“Alright, see you in a while.”</p>

      <p>Her bestie jogged down an alley. Yumi also turned around after finishing her 『Kiba burger』. She was reluctant to visit ‘Drunkard’s alley’, but it was a place she had to go if she wanted to search for the kidnappers.</p>

      <p>As Yumi made her way back to the slums; she was shocked to find denizens of Forest’s Edge trying to head down the slums’ alley.</p>

      <p>“W-Wait! Where are you going?”</p>

      <p>The two denizens of Forest’s Edge turned back and looked at her. One was a hunter wearing the hide of a kiba, while the other was dressed in the typical fashion of a Forest’s Edge woman. The male hunter was tall and buff, while the woman was smaller but plump.</p>

      <p>“…I’m sorry, but you are?”</p>

      <p>“I-I’m Yumi of the 《West Wind Inn》. You better stay away from there. That’s the nest of hooligans who drink in the day!”</p>

      <p>“Nest of hooligans… Even more reason for me to search that place.”</p>

      <p>The bulky body of that man was intimidating, but his voice was calm. His face didn’t look scary either, and looked polished and competent like his body. His clear eyes and gentle expression gave the impression of a reliable old man.</p>

      <p>“…I know the denizens of Forest’s Edge are confident in their abilities, but the people lurking there are dangerous. You don’t want to cause any incident in town, do you?”</p>

      <p>“Yes, but we have to search all the places in town. If not, we won’t be able to convince the people in the city.”</p>

      <p>“Convince? What do you mean?”</p>

      <p>“We intend to prove that Asuta isn’t outside the city. We will then negotiate with the nobles and request for permission to search the inside of the city.”</p>

      <p>After saying that, the Forest’s Edge hunter suddenly smiled:</p>

      <p>“I forgot to introduce myself. I’m a denizen of Forest’s Edge, Kaslan Lutim of Lutim house. This is my younger sister, Molum. Thank you for your concern, Yumi from the 《West Wind Inn》.”</p>

      <p>That was how Yumi met Kaslan Lutim.</p>

      <p>And that drew open the curtain of the small adventure they had on that day.</p>
    </section>

    <section epub:type="subchapter">
      <h2 id="sigil_toc_id_14">2</h2>

      <p>Yumi and the denizens of Forest’s Edge walked together into the slums. They had just entered, so the scenery didn’t look much different. By the way, since there were more guard patrols than usual, the residents in the slums were all staying home cautiously.</p>

      <p>“This is the part of the Post Station Town where the very impoverished and problematic people live. Even the guards don’t dare venture here alone.”</p>

      <p>“Is that so. It looks no different from the street outside.”</p>

      <p>“This is just the outer edge of the slums. You need to be more careful as you go further in.”</p>

      <p>Yumi said as a familiar sign appeared before her. That was Yumi’s home, the 《West Wind Inn》. Yumi moved quickly and used Kaslan Lutim’s huge body to hide herself.</p>

      <p>“Sorry, let me hide for a while. If my parents see me, they will want me to go home.”</p>

      <p>“You are helping Asuta despite your parent’s objection?”</p>

      <p>“Of course, isn’t that what friends do?”</p>

      <p>Kaslan Lutim narrowed his eyes gently and checked Yumi out.</p>

      <p>“Yes; to us, Asuta is an irreplaceable friend. I’m glad to know that the townsfolk think so too.”</p>

      <p>“It’s embarrassing if you say that so seriously.”</p>

      <p>Yumi hid behind Kaslan Lutim as they walked past the 《West Wind Inn》.</p>

      <p>Before long, they reached a junction. From here onwards, the houses looked sloppily built. The residents here was probably too poor to afford repairs to their buildings.</p>

      <p>“Walk down this street; I had already investigated the area around here.”</p>

      <p>“That’s a big help. Molum and I were planning to spend this entire day to search this place.”</p>

      <p>“But the problem is the ‘Drunkard’s alley’ ahead. A bunch of unreasonable hooligans is there.”</p>

      <p>Yumi said as she glanced at the other member of their group.</p>

      <p>“Are you fine with this? This isn’t a place a young girl like you should be going.”</p>

      <p>“Aren’t you a young girl too?”</p>

      <p>The girl named Molum Lutim smiled innocently. She was a very cute girl, unlike her brother. She was a little plump, but more charming than skinny girls. She had bright eyes and her round cheeks looked very soft.</p>

      <div class="imgBox">
        <img src="../Images/0014.png" alt="Illustration"/><!--  https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/jLrgG3p6wCV4v8DZ6x3f8YsrFz7FNREgOg2Y_eLbjZvRM8Bk_ZwSYx1GDFPLl_6kJkPIWOD1usUZGGZrInKYMlQUdHgpQxxZmHFqxyn5gePpH2UU9Ml2JYIgV-5Ivr9KDYlajolR  -->
      </div>

      <p>“I’m fifteen. Yumi, how old are you?”</p>

      <p>“Me? I’m sixteen.”</p>

      <p>“Sixteen, huh. You look very mature.”</p>

      <p>In the Post Station Town, sixteen wasn’t considered a child anymore. Yumi’s parents were already looking for a prospective match for her.</p>

      <p>“If you are fifteen, your brother isn’t much older, right?”</p>

      <p>“I’m twenty-four. There are five siblings in the Lutim main house; I’m the eldest and Molum is the youngest.”</p>

      <p>“Five siblings, huh. Since the Wu clan is like that too, there are many kids in the Forest’s Edge!”</p>

      <p>“Yes, having many children is an important job for the denizens of Forest’s Edge too.”</p>

      <p>For Yumi, talking to a hunter of Forest’s Edge was a rare experience.</p>

      <p>“By the way, how many of your tribemates are in town?”</p>

      <p>“About sixty. A man is paired up with a woman; we are searching the Turan region to the north of the city, the Post Station Town, and the southern farmlands.”</p>

      <p>Sixty denizens of Forest’s Edge being in town was a huge thing. With half of them being buffed Forest’s Edge hunters, the townsfolk must be spooked.</p>

      <p>But Yumi didn’t have any problem with that.</p>

      <p>“Aren’t there hundreds of denizens in Forest’s Edge? Only sixty of you came?”</p>

      <p>“Yes. There were many who wanted to take part in the search for Asuta, but I stopped them. Only the Wu clan and their kin are resting for the hunting offseason right now, so after excluding the elderly and children, only sixty of us came to town.”</p>

      <p>“Hunting offseason?”</p>

      <p>“Yes, the hunters of Forest’s Edge rest three times every year. The Wu clan’s kin just happened to be in the offseason.”</p>

      <p>“Is that so.”</p>

      <p>Yumi thought about ending the topic, but she couldn’t stop herself.</p>

      <p>“Sorry, I want to ask. Compared to Asuta, is the hunting work… more important?”</p>

      <p>“Yes, we are afraid of the nobles in the city finding fault with us if we neglect to hunt kiba.”</p>

      <p>“…Are you afraid of the nobles?”</p>

      <p>“Yes, we are suspecting that the goal of this incident is to expose the weak points of the Forest’s Edge.”</p>

      <p>The denizens of Forest’s Edge were ordered by the nobles in Genos to perform the tedious job of hunting kiba. If they neglected this work, they would have no excuse if the nobles find fault with them.</p>

      <p>“This sound complicated. Who is the noble behind this incident…?”</p>

      <p>“It’s not clear yet. Maybe it’s the work of someone trying to pit the denizens of Forest’s Edge against the nobles.”</p>

      <p>“Well, I won’t be surprised if there really is a retard like that. However… Thanks to Asuta, the thinking of the townsfolk has changed.”</p>

      <p>Yumi sighed, and looked up at the tall Kaslan Lutim:</p>

      <p>“It’s a pity that this had to happen now. Maybe… the townsfolk will start fearing the denizens of Forest’s Edge again.”</p>

      <p>“It’s possible. However, there are still people like you who are concerned about the denizens of Forest’s Edge.”</p>

      <p>Kaslan Lutim said with a gentle smile.</p>

      <p>“The townsfolk didn’t yell at us to ‘scram on back to Forest’s Edge’, and there are many things that feel different too. I think the people in town are becoming more and more discontent towards the nobles.”</p>

      <p>“Well, that’s true. No matter what, Asuta was abducted by bad guys this time. Anyone who finds fault with the denizens of Forest’s Edge must be sick.”</p>

      <p>“…I’m glad that you feel that way.”</p>

      <p>As Kaslan Lutim answered her in an even tone, they reached another junction.</p>

      <p>Yumi stopped and looked at the siblings who didn’t resemble each other.</p>

      <p>“This way leads to the notorious ‘Drunkard’s alley’. I want to ask again, are you sure you don’t want to let me handle this alone?”</p>

      <p>“Yes. Since this is a suspicious place, we want to verify it personally.”</p>

      <p>“Alright. To be frank, I can’t search every part of this place on my own, so I’m grateful for your help… But be careful, alright? This is definitely more dangerous than the Post Station Town.”</p>

      <p>Kaslan Lutim nodded without saying anything.</p>

      <p>He showed no fear at all. With this powerful hunter here, the hooligans in the ‘Drunkard’s alley’ might just be flying like rats.</p>

      <p>“Let us be off then. Keep your guard up.”</p>

      <p>With that decided, Yumi headed down the alley.</p>

      <p>The wooden buildings on either side looked more and more run down. Those who had seen prosperous streets would feel this is a wreckage. There was a sour smell in the air, and the stench seemed to have taken root here.</p>

      <p>“It’s quiet. But at the same time… I can feel the gazes of many people upon us.”</p>

      <p>“Hmm. They are probably peeking because strangers are here.”</p>

      <p>Yumi shrugged and headed to a house nearby. She knocked, and a scary voice responded: “What is it?”</p>

      <p>“We are looking for someone. If it’s not too much trouble, can I ask some questions?”</p>

      <p>The door was shut, but it was rotten and had holes everywhere. A pair of eyes peeked outside from one of the holes.</p>

      <p>“You are already troubling by calling me. I don’t know what you want, but go find someone else.”</p>

      <p>The occupant seemed to be an elderly woman. Her brown eyes had the light of suspicion and wariness.</p>

      <p>“Don’t say that and just hear me out. Both of us live in the same vicinity after all.”</p>

      <p>“…A girl dressed like you must be from the outside.”</p>

      <p>“No way, I’m the daughter of the 《West Wind Inn》 just further down the street, isn’t that around this area?”</p>

      <p>The old lady behind the door narrowed her eyes.</p>

      <p>“《West Wind Inn》, huh. Can you tell me the name of the innkeeper?”</p>

      <p>“Of course I know my Dad’s name. He is Samus, his wife is Shiru. Actually, my Dad married into the family.”</p>

      <p>There was a loud noise of the door bar being opened. Even a rundown door like this had a lock.</p>

      <p>“You are the daughter of that Shiru? You are pretty, unlike your mother.”</p>

      <p>“How rude. Never mind, I take after my father.”</p>

      <p>“Fufu, that Shiru’s daughter. Who are you looking for, and who are these people…?”</p>

      <p>“These are denizens of Forest’s Edge. Grandma, you should know about the denizens of Forest’s Edge, right?”</p>

      <p>Kaslan Lutim and Molum Lutim bowed without a word. The old lady watched their quiet demeanor and grunted.</p>

      <p>“This is the first time I’m seeing a ‘kiba eater’ from so close up. Why did you bring them here?”</p>

      <p>“I already said that I’m looking for someone. Asuta who was abducted from the main street and the culprit who kidnapped him. Erm, Asuta has dark hair and eyes, a 17 years old boy who looks a little cute. The kidnappers…”</p>

      <p>Yumi stopped here, and Kaslan Lutim continued:</p>

      <p>“The kidnappers are a dark-skinned man who looks like an easterner and a stout westerner man. The two of them are wanted on suspicion of kidnapping by the Post Station Town.”</p>

      <p>“Hmmp. There are many delinquents around here, but I have never seen an easterner wander here.”</p>

      <p>“More specifically, he is a mixed blood between the east and the west. His name is Sangjura; he has brown hair and eyes that looked different from easterners.”</p>

      <p>“Never seen him. Go ask Dataz.”</p>

      <p>“Dataz? Who’s that?”</p>

      <p>“The delinquent head that runs this place. Any outsiders who want to live here have to meet him first.”</p>

      <p>“I see, thank you.”</p>

      <p>Kaslan Lutim bowed, and that old lady closed the door without a second look at them.</p>

      <p>“…Where might that Dataz be?”</p>

      <p>“W-Wait. You want to visit his place? The head of the ‘Drunkard’s alley’ isn’t some nice guy, you know?”</p>

      <p>“But, it will be faster than searching the houses one at a time.”</p>

      <p>Yumi sighed and then scratched her long hair.</p>

      <p>“Alright then. I believe in your capabilities, okay? Hey, grandma…! Where can we find that scoundrel Dataz?”</p>

      <p>“It’s the building with a red roof in the center of the street!”</p>

      <p>A crude vice answered from the house.</p>

      <p>They walked down the street with that in mind and found a house that matched that description. Painting houses with different colors wasn’t anything special, but this house was probably painted a long time ago. The blackish red looked like blood had been splashed on it and felt a little disgusting.</p>

      <p>Yumi caught her breath and knocked the door of this creepy house.</p>

      <p>“Is Dataz in? I want to ask something!”</p>

      <p>There wasn’t any response for quite a long while.</p>

      <p>Finally, the door opened with a creepy creak, and a large man taller than Kaslan Lutim appeared.</p>

      <p>“Who are you…? What business do you have with Dataz…?”</p>

      <p>“I want to ask if there had been any newcomers lately.”</p>

      <p>Yumi answered in a strong tone, which was the norm in the slums. You might lose your life if you show others your weak side.</p>

      <p>“I’m Yumi from the 《West Wind Inn》; these two are denizens of Forest’s Edge, Kaslan Lutim and Molum Lutim. I don’t want any trouble, I just want to ask some questions.”</p>

      <p>“Denizens of Forest’s Edge…?”</p>

      <p>The large man looked at Kaslan Lutim uneasily.</p>

      <p>Kaslan Lutim was a head taller than Yumi, while the large man was half a head taller than him. With his log-like limbs and bulging tummy, he was one size fatter than Kaslan Lutim.</p>

      <p>Before that man could say anything else, an energetic voice came from the meshed windows.</p>

      <p>“Hey, let them in! I want to see those denizens of Forest’s Edge!”</p>

      <p>The large man stepped back without turning around.</p>

      <p>Yumi clenched her fists drenched in cold sweat and led the way in.</p>

      <p>The first thing she saw was a corridor. It was a long passageway that branched out to either side at the end. The large man headed to the right, and Yumi’s group followed.</p>

      <p>This house had a strange layout. That voice earlier came from a room facing the streets, but the entrance to that room was at the end of such a complicated corridor. She didn’t really want to know why it was built this way.</p>

      <p>“Welcome, dear guests. This is the first time I have invited denizens of Forest’s Edge into my home.”</p>

      <p>There were five men in the room. This was a room with a round table commonly found in bars, with several chairs around it. The one sitting in the innermost seat was the one who was speaking.</p>

      <p>He had a small stature and was probably shorter than Yumi when standing. His limbs were slender and weak, his hair sparse, but his eyes were lively. He was probably older than Yumi’s father.</p>

      <p>“I’m the owner of this house, Dataz. What business do you have with me?”</p>

      <p>Yumi didn’t expect the need to introduce herself again and repeated what she said to the old lady earlier.</p>

      <p>“I see; a villain that looks like an easterner, huh. Recently… I heard someone like that is living around here, but don’t remember him coming to greet me.”</p>

      <p>“Really!?”</p>

      <p>Yumi leaned forward with a start.</p>

      <p>Dataz and the people around him laughed cheerfully.</p>

      <p>“I won’t lie if it doesn’t benefit me or say any truth that might undermine myself.”</p>

      <p>“You are saying you want a reward? I don’t have anything I can offer right now.”</p>

      <p>“Is that so? It will be a problem if you don’t have the cash to spare.”</p>

      <p>Yumi frowned and stepped forward as if she was protecting Molum Lutim.</p>

      <p>“If you have any bad ideas, I suggest you stop. If you want my necklace or bangles, I can give them all to you.”</p>

      <p>“I’m not interested in such trinkets. Well then, would you like to test your brute force?”</p>

      <p>Dataz shrugged as he said that.</p>

      <p>“But I don’t want to dirty my home with blood. How about a little strength competition?”</p>

      <p>“Strength competition?”</p>

      <p>“During festivals, aren’t there events where men compete with their strength? I have never won that before, but this guy is very confident in his muscles.”</p>

      <p>And, of course, he was referring to the large man they met earlier. He was the only one staring at Kaslan Lutim without smiling.</p>

      <p>“If you can win this guy, I will tell you where the villains are. If you lose. Let’s see… I will take the blade on your waist. That thing looks more useful than those cheap accessories.”</p>

      <p>“Dataz, how about taking the kiba hide too? It can serve as proof of winning against a hunter of Forest’s Edge, and you can strut it around to show off.”</p>

      <p>When he heard what one of his goons said, Dataz smiled arrogantly.</p>

      <p>“That’s right. How about it, Forest’s Edge hunter?”</p>

      <p>“I’m fine with that; what is the win condition of the contest?”</p>

      <p>Kaslan Lutim’s face didn’t change at all.</p>

      <p>Dataz happily showed his lecherous eyes.</p>

      <p>“There’s nothing complicated. The one who gets floored loses, got it?”</p>

      <p>“That will be the same as our harvest festival then; I have no problems with that.”</p>

      <p>Kaslan Lutim took off the sheathed blade on his waist and handed it to Molum Lutim.</p>

      <p>“Is punching and kicking allowed? Those are banned in the competition within Forest’s Edge.”</p>

      <p>“That’s boring, what’s so good about watching people wrestle?”</p>

      <p>“I’m fine with anything. It’s not all about being interesting.”</p>

      <p>Kaslan Lutim was steady and calm. The large man’s face was a little red, probably agitated by how stoic Kaslan Lutim was.</p>

      <p>“Alright, make some space! One match to settle it all! Well… You will be too exhausted to have a second match anyway.”</p>

      <p>Following Dataz’s orders, the men pushed the tables and chairs to the side. Only Dataz remained seated as the space was cleared out in front of him.</p>

      <p>Kaslan Lutim and the large man walked into the empty space. Yumi held Molum Lutim’s hand unconsciously, but Molum just smiled:</p>

      <p>“Don’t worry; Kaslan-nii is one of the eight braves amongst the hunters of the Wu kin.”</p>

      <p>Dataz lazily raised his arm above his head and then swung it down in a flash.</p>

      <p>“Begin!”</p>

      <p>The large man charged at Kaslan Lutim.</p>

      <p>Kaslan Lutim’s kiba cape swayed gently.</p>

      <p>And then… The next instant, the back of the large man slammed heavily onto the floor.</p>

      <p>It wasn’t clear what happened. Yumi could feel the impact from her feet as the large man groaned in pain.</p>

      <p>“Are you alright? You are heavy, so that should be rather painful.”</p>

      <p>Kaslan Lutim asked out of concern, but that large man just kept groaning without a reply. On a closer look, half of his body had crashed through the flooring.</p>

      <p>“I held back, so you shouldn’t be hurt. Will you concede this victory to me…?”</p>

      <p>Kaslan Lutim slowly turned to look at Dataz.</p>

      <p>Dataz was standing stiffly there with his right hand swung down, staring with his eyes wide open like an astonished kid.</p>

    <section epub:type="subchapter">
      <h2 id="sigil_toc_id_15">3</h2>

      <p>“The easterner villain is supposedly living in old lady Jill’s rundown place.” Dataz told them.</p>

      <p>Kaslan Lutim was worried that they would pick more trouble with him, but the delinquents seemed to be stunned by Kaslan Lutim’s display of extraordinary strength and were in awe.</p>

      <p>He even gave a kind suggestion: “I don’t know who they are, but since they aren’t too cocky, I just leave them be. And… Semu aren’t easy to deal with, so I don’t want to mess with them. Be careful out there.”</p>

      <p>Kaslan Lutim searched for the place Dataz told them about as he asked Yumi:</p>

      <p>“What did he mean by Semu being hard to deal with? I do know that Sangjura has prowess comparable to a Forest’s Edge hunter though.”</p>

      <p>“Hmm? Isn’t he referring to poison, not physical prowess? I heard that it takes ten swordsmen to take down one Semu.”</p>

      <p>“Poison, huh. That’s really troublesome.”</p>

      <p>“That’s right. The Semu on the streets don’t look like bad guys, but I heard that they don’t need escorts when traveling around the continent. So they don’t fear bandits and beasts.”</p>

      <p>As they were chatting, their destination appeared before them. There was only one straight path leading here, so they wouldn’t have missed it.</p>

      <p>It was a rundown longhouse almost at the end of the ‘Drunkard’s alley’. The single-story building was divided into six apartments and seemed to be on the verge of falling. It was so bad that no one would expect anyone to live here.</p>

      <p>“But, shouldn’t Sangjura be lodging in the 《<span style="background-color: transparent; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;">Cryptic Venerable Inn》? Maybe the villain staying here is someone else?”</span></p>

      <p>“I don’t know. He might have made preparations ahead of time, since he was planning to create an incident at that inn.”</p>

      <p>In any case, since they were already here, they went ahead to investigate. Yumi was as tense as during her visit to Dataz’s house and knocked the door on the outermost side.</p>

      <p>A while later, there was still no response.</p>

      <p>Yumi was about to knock again when the sound of a door bar being removed echoed out.</p>

      <p>“Annoying, all the rooms are full.”</p>

      <p>Yumi suppressed the surprise in her heart and answered: “Ahh, you are old lady Jill? We are not looking for rooms.”</p>

      <p>She wasn’t surprised by Jill’s face, but the strange smell coming from the house. It was a sweet scent that made her dizzy, something Yumi had never smelled before.</p>

      <p>“Is that Semu herbs? I heard you rented a room to an easterner recently?”</p>

      <p>When she heard Yumi’s question, Jill frowned warily.</p>

      <p>She was a petite lady who was very old. Her back was bent almost to a right angle, and her right hand was holding a cane. Her sticky grey hair was combed back to over her head, and her yellowish skin had a tint of blackness like a whip.</p>

      <p>“I’m just checking to see if that easterner is someone I know. Is he here?”</p>

      <p>“…Someone you know? He said that he didn’t know anyone in Genos.”</p>

      <p>“Did I get the wrong person? He had light-colored hair, which was uncommon for easterners.”</p>

      <p>Worried that Sanjura might be using an alias, Yumi didn’t mention that name.</p>

      <p>Jill frowned:</p>

      <p>“…Whatever, just don’t cause any trouble. And who are they?”</p>

      <p>“They are denizens of Forest’s Edge. The tribe of kiba hunters living at the edge of the Mount Morga.”</p>

      <p>Jill walked outside as if she was pushing Yumi away, and deftly closed the door with her cane.</p>

      <p>“I won’t know if I don’t take a look. I will take this opportunity to collect tomorrow’s rent.”</p>

      <p>“Thank you, that’s a big help.”</p>

      <p>Yumi followed the old lady who was walking with unsteady steps.</p>

      <p>They went the opposite direction to the innermost room. The old lady stabbed the door crudely with her cane.</p>

      <p>“Hey, you have guests! And pay the rent for tomorrow too!”</p>

      <p>No response.</p>

      <p>Jill waited a while and then put her withered fingers on the door. It didn’t appear to be locked and was pushed open without any resistance.</p>

      <p>It was pitch-black inside. There was also a strange smell in the air, but it had a hint of sweet and sourness. It was revolting, like the scent of a beast.</p>

      <p>“Hey, is anyone there!? No good… It’s too dark, I can’t see anything.”</p>

      <p>“Excuse me, let me take a look.”</p>

      <p>Kaslan Lutim stepped forth, and Jill backed away docilely.</p>

      <p>However, Kaslan Lutim said with his head tilted:</p>

      <p>“Something like a screen is blocking the way, so I can’t see inside… I can feel a strange presence.”</p>

      <p>“What do you mean by strange presence? I allow you to go in. If you see anyone, drag them out. It’s a pain if someone dies in my house.”</p>

      <p>Kaslan Lutim nodded and marched fearlessly into the dark.</p>

      <p>Jill who was watching him go made a quizzical grunt: “Huh?”</p>

      <p>“What is it? What did you see?”</p>

      <p>“Hmm? It’s too dark, I can’t see anything.”</p>

      <p>Yumi and Molum Lutim strained their necks and looked into the darkness.</p>

      <p>The windows were covered with curtains, making the inside as dark as the night. They could only see the back of Kaslan Lutim who was walking in.</p>

      <p>“It’s too dark…”</p>

      <p>Yumi was suddenly kicked on her back mid-sentence.</p>

      <p>She stumbled onto the shoulders of Molum Lutim in front of her, and the two of them fell down at the entrance. At the same time, the place went dark as the door was closed.</p>

      <p>“That hurts…! Hey, old lady, what are you doing!!”</p>

      <p>Yumi propped herself up in a panic and groped for the door. But for some reason, the door refused to budge, as if it was a wall. Yumi felt a chill down her spine.</p>

      <p>“Wait! Stop kidding around! Open up!”</p>

      <p>“Yumi, be quiet… There’s something wrong here.”</p>

      <p>Molum Lutim grabbed Yumi’s arm. At the same time, a strange noise screeched through the darkness. Then came the fluttering sound of cloth swaying in the wind. It sounded like a winged creature flying in the air.</p>

      <p>Yumi hugged her head with a “Hyahh!”. She felt something brush pass her face.</p>

      <p>“Molum! Keep your head down! These creatures are dangerous!”</p>

      <p>Kaslan Lutim’s voice mixed together the noise of something smashing and the screech of the creature. Kaslan Lutim seemed to be battling those creatures in the dark.</p>

      <p>“Escape outside! These creatures can discern our position even in the darkness!”</p>

      <p>“The door has been closed! It is probably locked from the outside!”</p>

      <p>“Got it! Please hold on!”</p>

      <p>Sound of something flying above her head came in the dark. It wasn’t loud, but there was more than one creature. Yumi felt she was caught in a nightmare.</p>

      <p>The sounds of fighting never ceased. Yumi groped and found Molum Lutim’s warm fingers, and held them tightly. She prayed to the western god that the nightmare would end soon.</p>

      <p>“Molum! Don’t move!”</p>

      <p>Kaslan Lutim came from their front.</p>

      <p>And then something big flew over Yumi’s head, and the door was knocked open at the same time. It was Kaslan Lutim who jumped over Yumi and sent the door flying with a kick.</p>

      <p>The heavy door crashed onto the other side of the street, and white light flooded in through the entrance. Guided by this light, Yumi and Molum Lutim escaped successfully.</p>

      <p>After that, the armed Kaslan Lutim rushed to their back. He stood before Yumi and Molum who were sitting on the ground and swung his saber at the darkness in the room.</p>

      <p>“Those… are probably creatures known as bats.”</p>

      <p>“B-Bats?”</p>

      <p>“Yes. I heard they appear sometimes at night in the Forest’s Edge. Not only do they suck the blood of human and beasts, their fangs are also poisoned. A dangerous creature.”</p>

      <p>But these winged beasts would never leave the darkness, it was their nature to fear the light.</p>

      <p>“Molum, Yumi, are you bitten?”</p>

      <p>“No, I just kept on swinging this around.”</p>

      <p>Molum Lutim who replied with a smile was holding a stick. She was fending off the bats with her bat, but Yumi didn’t notice that at all.</p>

      <p>“Yumi, you were locked in there? Is the culprit that old lady Jill?”</p>

      <p>“That’s right! Where did that old lady go!?”</p>

      <p>Yumi swept the area, but there was no one on the street. She seemed to have run away after locking Yumi’s group in the room.</p>

      <p>“Why did she set us up? Does she have a grudge against the denizens of Forest’s Edge?”</p>

      <p>“Ask her that yourself! Let’s just go back to the house now!”</p>

      <p>That old lady was using a cane and was unsteady in her steps, so she couldn’t have run to another street. They went back to the house they were at before, but it had been locked from the inside.</p>

      <p>“So you are in there! Hey, old lady! You went too far! Do you have a grudge against us!?”</p>

      <p>And, of course, there was no answer. Yumi clicked her tongue and then turned back and said to Kaslan Lutim:</p>

      <p>“Hey! Break this door down!”</p>

      <p>“Well… Kicking someone’s door down isn’t something that I like to do.”</p>

      <p>“I don’t know what your fetish is; we can’t just leave that grandma alone, right!?”</p>

      <p>With an apologetic face, Kaslan Lutim suddenly kicked the door. It fell off its hinges and flopped inside the entrance.</p>

      <p>The first thing they saw was a vacant room with dirty flooring. To the left was a stove with a small pot on top. The stove wasn’t lit, but there was a sweet fragrance coming from the pot.</p>

      <p>Looking in the opposite direction of the stove was a large drape, which was probably the entrance to another room.</p>

      <p>Kaslan Lutim surveyed the area and then moved cautiously in that direction. Yumi and Molum Lutim followed closely behind while being wary of anyone outside.</p>

      <p>With his right hand on the hilt, Kaslan Lutim grabbed the bottom of the drape with his left. He pulled it open in one shot, and the voice of the grandma screaming: “Hyahh!” came from inside.</p>

      <p>It was Jill.</p>

      <p>She was hiding in a corner of the small room with a pale face.</p>

      <p>There was someone beside her. That man was wearing ragged and torn clothes, and trinkets covered his neck and arms… He was an easterner as old as Jill.</p>

      <p>Half of his hair was white and had mixed together with his black hair, giving it a rust-like color. His black complexion was full of wrinkles, and he should be quite tall if he stood up, but his build was as lanky as a bean pole.</p>

      <p>“Ah, spare us! He is too weak and frail to commit any crimes! It’s too much to arrest him!”</p>

      <p>Jill leaned onto the skinny easterner and started weeping. Yumi was disappointed after seeing that.</p>

      <p>“So this old grampa is the easterner living here? We are looking for a young Semu that is still capable of misdeeds!”</p>

      <p>“Huh? So you are not here to arrest him…?”</p>

      <p>“Why would we hand over someone we didn’t know to the guards!? You are too quick at jumping to conclusions.”</p>

      <p>As they chatted, the old Semu sat on the floor emotionlessly. The easterner thought it was shameful to show their feelings.</p>

      <p>“I seem to have caused harm to others… Jill isn’t at fault, please have mercy…”</p>

      <p>“I don’t think she is not at fault. One wrong step and the bats would have sucked us dry.”</p>

      <p>“Those bats are caught to make medicine… We are really sorry…”</p>

      <p>“Hmmp. This grandpa speaks western really fluently.”</p>

      <p>He was also blind in one eye. His right black eye was serene, while his left was murky grey.</p>

      <p>“We are looking for a criminal named Sangjura. Just in case, let me ask you this; have you seen such a man? Light brown hair and eyes, claims to be mix blood between east and west, a young man who looks like an easterner.”</p>

      <p>“I don’t know… I’m a sinner who is too disgraced to return to Semu again and has cut all ties with easterners… And I don’t know any west and east mixed blood…”</p>

      <p>“Is that so, that’s a shame. That man abducted my good friend and is an unforgivable criminal.”</p>

      <p>“Abducted your friend… I see…”</p>

      <p>The Semu old man said as he closed his right eye. He stared right at Kaslan Lutim with his murky grey eyes.</p>

      <p>“Could it be… that ‘starless one’…?”</p>

      <p>“…What did you just say?”</p>

      <p>Kaslan Lutim furrowed his brows slightly. His ever calm eyes now had a gleam as sharp as a blade.</p>

      <p>“…You are the ‘star of the hawk’ guarding the three-headed lion… You are facing an important turn of fate alongside the light and darkness brought by the ‘starless one’…”</p>

      <p>“An important turn of fate.”</p>

      <p>Kaslan Lutim muttered, as if he was savoring these words.</p>

      <p>Yumi was completely lost.</p>

      <p>“I can’t read the fate of the ‘starless one’ since he doesn’t have a star… The wheel of fate is still turning now… Even if you don’t catch a sight of him, the ‘starless one’ still lingers over your heads… When the clouds clear and the dust settles, you will meet him once again…”</p>

      <p>With that, the old man rested the shoulder that Jill was grabbing onto the wall behind him.</p>

      <p>“That’s all that I could see… I hope you can forgive Jill…”</p>

      <p>“Alright, thank you for your kind words.”</p>

      <p>Kaslan Lutim let go of his hilt, then turned and left. He removed the hand holding the drape up, and the two elderly people disappeared behind it.</p>

      <p>“Let’s go back. There’s nothing to gain from staying here.”</p>

      <p>“W-Wait. What was all that nonsense just now? Is that easterner an astrologist?”</p>

      <p>“Yes. Another Semu astrologist also called Asuta the ‘starless one’. I don’t really understand astrology, but I couldn’t ignore it completely either… At the very least, it could ease some of the worries in my heart.”</p>

      <p>Kaslan Lutim left Jill house and smiled gently under the bright sun.</p>

      <p>“But we can’t just sit idly and wait for Asuta to come back. I want to finish my job.”</p>

      <p>“Yes! Let’s check out the next street!”</p>

      <p>“Alright.”</p>

      <p>Kaslan Lutim nodded.</p>

      <p>Yumi felt she had just woken from a nightmare. She finally recovered her energy as she looked at Kaslan Lutim’s warm smile.</p>

      <h2 id="sigil_toc_id_16">4</h2>

      <p>Three days later, at night…</p>

      <p>Yumi, Kaslan Lutim and the others gathered at the city gates.</p>

      <p>Everyone was waiting for Asuta to come back.</p>

      <p><i>Let Asuta return safely…</i>Everyone prayed for Asuta as they waited there worriedly.</p>

      <p>“It will be fine. If what Geta said is true, we will definitely save him.”</p>

      <p>Yumi who was standing beside Kaslan Lutim muttered softly, as if she was talking to herself.</p>

      <p>Asuta was in the city. The one who abducted him was the daughter of Pyschkurewuss, who was forcing Asuta to cook for her… News of this had spread early this morning.</p>

      <p>No one knew if that was true. But the denizens of Forest’s Edge believed in it and formulated a plan. And now, Asuta’s family member named Ai Fa went to Pyschkurewuss’ manor together with a noble.</p>

      <p>“We will wait outside the gate. Yumi, will you come too…?”</p>

      <p>As expected, Yumi said to Kaslan Lutim:</p>

      <p>“Of course. There’s no reason for me to refuse… But, what happened?”</p>

      <p>“Well, we want to let Pyschkurewuss know that the truth has spread outside the city. If we don’t do this, he will brush off all of this.”</p>

      <p>Yumi didn’t really understand, but she decided to accept his invitation. In the past few days, she learned how logical and sensible he was, and his intelligence could rival the people in town.</p>

      <p>Many townsfolk who were told the same thing as Yumi gathered here. The guards surrounded them fearfully, but not a single person left.</p>

      <p>The sun was already setting. A group was standing before the white rock walls with several torches flickering on the wall.</p>

      <p>The drawbridge had been raised, and the gates— tightly shut. The rock walls were also surrounded by a deep moat, so the walls were some distance away. Yumi couldn’t even throw a rock that far, and Asuta had been abducted there.</p>

      <p>“Yumi-nee…”</p>

      <p>A petite figure walked to Yumi’s side. It was the daughter of the vegetable vendor, Tara. Yumi had met this kid at Asuta’s stall several times.</p>

      <p>“Asuta-niichan is alright, right? He will definitely come back, right?”</p>

      <p>“He is fine. Asuta won’t be beaten by such a small setback.”</p>

      <p>Yumi knelt down and nodded firmly.</p>

      <p>Tara nodded with tears in her eyes and returned to her father.</p>

      <p>Yumi stood up, and Kaslan Lutim said to her: “Don’t worry. The noble Polarse is helping us, so the other side wouldn’t do anything foolish.”</p>

      <p>He was staring right at the gates.</p>

      <p>“In the end, only a noble can prosecute a noble. We did what we can.”</p>

      <p>“You are working hard now too. The effort of everyone here is necessary for us to tread on the right path. And… If we didn’t cause such an uproar in the town, Polarse wouldn’t have acted for us.”</p>

      <p>Kaslan Lutim had a steady smile as he looked at the gates.</p>

      <p>“The denizens of Forest’s Edge, Post Station Town, and the nobles in this city… Right now, all these groups are working together on the same side. This is the bridge built by Asuta.”</p>

      <p>“Yes, we will make Asuta cook delicious food for making us worry so much.”</p>

      <p>Yumi made a show of being strong. At this moment, what sounded like the death throes of beasts came from the darkness.</p>

      <p>The drawbridge was lowered.</p>

      <p>Yumi leaned forward unconsciously.</p>

      <p>Creak, creak, creak… The bridge made dull thuds as it slowly lowered to the ground. The guards armed with spears watched the gathered mob closely, looking for any dangerous movements.</p>

      <p>There was a thump as the bridge landed on the ground. At the same time, the gates opened and darkness like the maw of a monster appeared on the other side.</p>

      <p>A creaking carriage then came out of the darkness. It was a large box carriage pulled by two Totos. One Totos rider flanked the left and right side of the carriage.</p>

      <p>“Gulp…” Someone gulped.</p>

      <p>It was completely silent. Everyone waited with bated breath, wondering if Asuta was safe. Yumi just realized her knees were shaking.</p>

      <p>Kaslan Lutim said quietly: “Things will be fine…”</p>

      <p>The Totos carriage stopped before traversing the entire bridge. It then turned around and headed back to the gate, leaving two figures behind on the drawbridge.</p>

      <p>The crowd erupted in cheers.</p>

      <p>One of these figures was definitely Asuta.</p>

      <p>Yumi closed her eyes and offered thanks to the god of the west. This was the first time she offered such sincere prayers.</p>

      <p>A heavy sound was mixed amidst the cheers. Yumi opened her eyes again and found Asuta and the other figure back on the ground, and the drawbridge raised.</p>

      <p>Asuta was swarmed by a large crowd, with some embracing him and others wailing in tears.</p>

      <p>“…Forest, thank you for your mercy.”</p>

      <p>She looked back at Kaslan Lutim when she heard that, and found him with his eyes closed, offering prayers to his god.</p>

      <p>“Come, Yumi, go greet Asuta.”</p>

      <p>“Shouldn’t you go meet up with him first?”</p>

      <p>“I can take my time later. It’s embarrassing to say this… But my legs are shaking.”</p>

      <p>“What a coincidence, me too.”</p>

      <p>Upon hearing Yumi’s reply, Kaslan Lutim smiled. His smile was different from usual, and more childish and bashful.</p>

      <p>“Yumi, thank you for taking care of me. I can finally tell you since Asuta is back safely…”</p>

      <p>“Hmm? What is it?”</p>

      <p>“When we were searching for Asuta together with Molum three days ago, it felt like I had turned back to a child; I had a lot of fun.”</p>

      <p>Yumi opened her eyes wide in shock.</p>

      <p>She then smiled at the bashful Kaslan Lutim.</p>

      <p>“Really? Me too.”</p>

      <p>After saying that, Yumi ran towards Asuta.</p>

      <p>Asuta was laughing and crying at the same time. Yumi didn’t know what to say, so she just showed a brilliant smile with a thousand thoughts on her mind.</p>

      <p>And so, Yumi and the others got back Asuta, someone who was irreplaceable to them.</p>
