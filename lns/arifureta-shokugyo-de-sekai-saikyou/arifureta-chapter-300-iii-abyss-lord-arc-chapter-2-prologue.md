Arifureta After III   Abyss Lord Arc Chapter 2   Prologue<br/>
<br/>
A voice could be heard.<br/>
Inside the darkness where one couldn’t even see an inch ahead, a repulsive voice was resounding.<br/>
That voice felt slimy, like a sticky sludge.<br/>
It’s already been heard for several thousand, several tens of thousands of times.<br/>
I also know about the development ahead of here. The same as the voice. I have seen it continuously repeating for several thousands, several tens of thousands of times.<br/>
No. To be more accurate, it wasn’t seeing, yes, it was remembering.<br/>
A memory that couldn’t possibly be forgotten. A memory that mustn’t be forgotten.<br/>
The repulsive reason of me being alive. It was the earliest scene my heart remembered.<br/>
*Gou-* The wind was blowing.<br/>
The darkness that was like a black ink that painted over anything it touched was swept away. What appeared in its place was a crimson flame――the fire of hell.<br/>
Inside the world that was dyed red, "it" was there.<br/>
The figure was like condensed darkness, or perhaps shadows. Red flames that were like its blood was gushing out from the countless cracks running along its surface, frying the surrounding to ash without pause.<br/>
The two hands that were clad in a hellfire were carelessly holding things that were once my parents. The eyes and mouth that were colored by the flames warped like a mocking sneer.<br/>
"Its" mouth moved slightly.<br/>
A voice could be heard.<br/>
The voice of "it" that I had heard several thousands, several tens of thousands of times.<br/>
I, who could do nothing except tremble, was impaled by "its" sneering laugh.<br/>
Flames were gushing out.<br/>
My important people were disappearing without leaving so much as even ash behind, and "its" hand was reaching forward.<br/>
The hand that was created from the hellfire and shadow completely filled my sight that was blurred by tears.<br/>
And then, hope and a future, a warm thing……as though to crush all of those things fully within its grasp――<br/>
–<br/>
–<br/>
–<br/>
「aAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAH」<br/>
A scream echoed inside a bedroom at midnight.<br/>
The soft blanket was brushed aside, and a young woman around the age of twenty lifted up her body like a released spring.<br/>
After looking at her normally, she was a woman with a good-looking and well-ordered appearance, but right now, her expression was warped in grief and terror. Her blonde hair that was normally wavy and looked soft was stuck to her cheeks and the nape of the neck from cold sweat in an unsightly state.<br/>
Only the sounds of rough breathing and rustling clothes resounded inside the room.<br/>
There, *knock knock* the room’s door was knocked upon.<br/>
「Claudia-sama?」(TN: Do you guys think I should use Miss Claudia here, or keep using Claudia-sama following the raw?)<br/>
「――」<br/>
A worried voice called out her name, the owner of this room――Claudia Barenberg. Her body twitched in surprise.<br/>
But, she immediately let out a large sigh, wiped the tears blurring her jade pupils with her sleeve, and she calmed down her breathing with her hand on her chest before replying.<br/>
「I’m fine, Wynn. I only got a bit of a nightmare. I’m sorry for the ruckus I caused.」<br/>
She endeavored to make her voice as calm and bright as she could. However, from the viewpoint of the person guarding the room from in front of the door, it was clear as day that the girl was only trying not to make others worried.<br/>
After all, this was something that had persisted for several years. At the very least, this would happen once or twice a week; sometimes it would even happen three or four times a week. Often Claudia would spring up from her bed while screaming at midnight.<br/>
The cause was common knowledge. Therefore, the people who idolized her also understood that it was something that couldn’t be solved that easily.<br/>
That was why, "at the very least", the person who served as the guard tonight spoke just like usual.<br/>
「If you like, Claudia-sama, how about I bring you something to drink? Luckily, Anna is brewing herb tea along with the change of shift, so how about Claudia-sama have some together with us?」<br/>
Surely that herb tea was also undoubtedly the kind that used an herb that would stimulate restful sleep.<br/>
Claudia made a warm smile at the consideration of them who were her guards, her comrades, and also her family. She felt like the coldness that was blanketing her heart, the emotion that she should reject, was softening.<br/>
「It’s a coincidence that my throat is dry right now. Please let me drink it if you will be so kind. Thank you, Wynn.」<br/>
「It’s nothing.」<br/>
After that, Claudia put her disarrayed attire in order and lightly wiped her hair and sweat. Then she invited Wynn, along with Anna who arrived at that time, to enter the room.<br/>
Wynn――Wynn Keyman was a lean young man with swept-back blonde hair. He was 28 years old. He had rare grey-colored pupils, and his appearance was gallant and stern. His personality was also serious. From his way of living that prized virtue, he was called as "knight" by his comrades.<br/>
Anna who was brewing the tea――Anna Folk was a girl with chestnut braided hair as her trademark. She was fifteen years old. Her eyes, which were as brown as her hair, were always shining with a liveliness that could be said to represent her personality.<br/>
For a while, they were amusing themselves with idle talk where Anna would be the one who did most of the talking while Claudia and Wynn would throw in appropriate comments.<br/>
Feeling her heart being warmed by the warm tea and the harmonious interaction with her comrades, Claudia felt her eyes getting heavy.<br/>
In the first place, her drooping eyes and gentle gaze were her trademarks, and her personality and looks also didn’t go against the impression of a gentle big sister that she gave off. Even her speaking tone was relaxed and calm, so when sleepiness was added in, it was even said that the synergy of her appearance and voice would exert the special ability of a powerful sleep encouragement.<br/>
When such a girl got drowsy eyes, naturally anyone who saw it would understand 「Ah, she is sleepy」.<br/>
Right now, it would be less than an hour before the sun rose, but Wynn and Anna recommended Claudia to sleep once more. After all looking closer, even Wynn and Anna who were her guards were also being visited by sleepiness. She was plainly obstructing their duty.<br/>
Claudia was hesitating because after thinking of the morning prayer, it felt like it would be better to stay awake like this. It was then that Wynn’s mobile phone suddenly started vibrating to inform him that it was receiving a call.<br/>
Wynn confirmed the caller before picking up the call.<br/>
「Wynn here.」<br/>
"……This is Aziz. Mission complete. I will board the plane after this."<br/>
「Thanks for your hard work. Were there any problems?」<br/>
"……None."<br/>
「I see. Tell me the details after you come back, but from your tone, it seems that the ruin and the relic aren’t it, huh?」<br/>
"……Yes. But, it’s dangerous. I sent you the data. Ask the management to deal with them."<br/>
「Acknowledged. I’ll report it as soon as I confirm the data.」<br/>
Hearing the safety of a comrade who went on a mission to steal information from a corporation in a certain country, not just Wynn, but Claudia and Anna also let out a faint sigh of relief.<br/>
Wynn’s tone became somewhat gentle, and he asked 「Is there anything else?」. There, the man who was called Aziz whose voice sounded like a young man’s faltered slightly in hesitation, then he spoke in a low voice.<br/>
"……There was, the "returnees’" data."<br/>
「! ……How much?」<br/>
"Members and their family structure. Also the detail from Britain."<br/>
Wynn spontaneously groaned.<br/>
The previous information was information that even Wynn’s group had collected to a certain degree. But, regarding the latter, currently, the information gathering wasn’t really progressing due to the obstruction from the intelligence department of the country in question.<br/>
He didn’t know how the aforementioned corporation obtained the information, but he guessed that it must’ve been obtained from a route that was peculiar to a corporation while inside his heart he rejoiced from being able to obtain the unanticipated data.<br/>
「Aziz, you did well. We are going to scrutinize the information here right away. Their strength and also the authenticity of it are unknown. Be very careful on your return.」<br/>
"Acknowledged."<br/>
After that, Wynn cut off the call after talking about two to three more matters.<br/>
「So we obtained the information about them……let’s pray that this will lead us to a better future.」<br/>
Claudia muttered with her characteristic leisurely tone. An earnestness was hidden inside her tone.<br/>
After that commotion, it was information that Claudia and others couldn’t stop wanting. However, even after they poured all their strength into it, not only were they unable to disclose the whole picture, they couldn’t even come into contact with them, far from that. Damage even reached their important comrades as the end result.<br/>
It became prohibited to come into contact with them until a definite measure could be obtained. And now they had obtained information about them. Claudia couldn’t suppress her feelings of exaltation.<br/>
「Wynn. This is a most important subject. Please be very careful in handling the obtained information, okay?」<br/>
「Understood. I will immediately report to the director. At the same time, I will also increase the alert level. We wholly don’t know their hand. It’s unknown when they will notice that this information has leaked. And after they know, if they followed it to us……」<br/>
Wynn shook his head. He was recalling what had happened to their comrades when attempting to come into contact with them. Anna was making the same expression as though she was feeling a headache and continued.<br/>
「I don’t want to do it anymore, you know? Work like returning the sanity of our comrades who were working hard to dig up a well in a developed country, or changing jobs into a mercenary killing maniac who was obsessed with murdering terrorists, or joining some animal protection group and running around to search for anyone to adopt stray dogs, and then bringing them back here. I thought I would get mad myself doing that.」<br/>
Anna was scrunching her face with an expression that looked like she was really hating it, or perhaps dreading it was more accurate. Her words naturally caused Claudia and Wynn to also get a faraway look from recalling their comrades who were overflowing with a volunteer spirit and sense of justice in various senses at that time.<br/>
Claudia drank the herb tea to calm down her heart, and then she opened her mouth 「Even so」 with a sorrowful face.<br/>
「Recently, the movement of "them" is getting increasingly active. That’s why it’s necessary for us to ascertain it. Just who are they? And then, whether they are the "same" as us. Perhaps there is some meaning that we obtained their information at this timing. That’s what I believe. Perhaps……」<br/>
Claudia smiled faintly and spoke.<br/>
――this might be the guidance of the Lord, you know?<br/>
She said.<br/>
‘Perhaps that might be so’, Wynn and Anna also nodded with a smile.<br/>
In the end, at that time her sleepiness was cleared up. Claudia dressed herself up, and then together with the other two she began her activities in order to accomplish her duty today.<br/>
Without knowing that unexpectedly one of "them" had already started moving.<br/>
–<br/>
–<br/>
–<br/>
A really normal house in Japan. It was in a residential area, so there were a lot of similar houses in the neighborhood. The two vehicles lined up in the parking spot in front of the house were a family car and a compact car of the types that were often seen.<br/>
That house didn’t have anything particularly standing out on it, so it was blending in well with the scenery of the residential area. However, regarding the house’s residents, there was something a bit peculiar about them.<br/>
Or more accurately, it was the family’s second son.<br/>
The family name written on the nameplate was――Endo.<br/>
Yes, it was the house of one of the "returnees", the man who was praised by his comrades with various sayings like "nonchalantly one of mankind’s strongest", "recently an automatic door won’t react at all against that guy, seriously", "you bastard, even though you already got a rabbit-eared Onee-san lover, what are you doing laying your hands on a blonde-haired beautiful girl too huuuh, I’m gonna kill you", and so on――the home of Endo Kousuke.<br/>
Currently, Kousuke was inside his room on the second floor. He was stuffing his travel baggage into his favorite rucksack that he received at the same time as when he enrolled in middle school.<br/>
His personality wasn’t particularly methodical, so he was only carelessly tossing in things like a change of clothes and so on without folding them first.<br/>
「Ee~rr, something like this, I guess? The rest can just be entered into the Treasure Warehouse.」<br/>
Kousuke talked to himself while showing a thinking gesture for a bit.<br/>
The important luggage could be entered into the Treasure Warehouse that Hajime gave him, so originally, he didn’t even need the rucksack, but it would be odd if he was empty-handed despite going abroad. There was no doubt he would get stared at suspiciously by the airport staff when in the emigration and immigration check.<br/>
He would also need to be careful of the surrounding’s attention when getting out the item he wanted from the Treasure Warehouse, so it was necessary to put some things into a rucksack to a certain degree.<br/>
「Even so, the Vatican huh……First, I’ll enter Italy’s Rome, but it will be the first time I’m going there, so I’m feeling a bit excited.」<br/>
He recalled several things that he had forgotten and tossed them into his rucksack carelessly again.<br/>
「It helps that I won’t meet a language barrier when going abroad, but……I want to go sightseeing if I’m going there anyway. ……With Rana.」<br/>
Thinking of his older lover who was an adorable rabbit-eared beauty, Kousuke’s expression broke into a wide grin slovenly.<br/>
Instantly, he felt a chill, and his body shivered. At the end of the view that he shared with his clone, the figure of Emily-chan staring unblinkingly at him with pupils of just monochrome color was……<br/>
「Cough-. Now then! I finished my preparations already! Let’s depart!」<br/>
He cut! Cut! CUUT! the shared field of vision. I didn’t see anything at all!<br/>
Under the thinking 「Kou-kun who is the right-hand man of the boss also needs at least seven wives who are somewhere around the world!」 of the first wife (according to the person) Rana Hauria, Emily-chan was more or less put into the position of the second wife. Emily-chan was really troubled sometimes.<br/>
The incident that occurred just a little while ago――the Berserk incident.<br/>
The girl who walked the path of research wholeheartedly since her childhood up till now as a genius unintentionally caused that incident that was related to the monster. Through that incident, the girl harbored a strong emotion of love toward Kousuke. Furthermore, it was her first love.<br/>
Her feelings were strong and undoubtedly the real thing.<br/>
Thus, even after it came to light that the target of her first love, Kousuke, had a lover named Rana, in the end, she was unable to give up. There was also how Rana herself welcomed her, and how Kousuke’s clone was living together with her in the Grant family home to protect her, where the interaction between the two was deepening. Day by day her feelings were growing stronger and deeper.<br/>
The level of her worries was also increasing in proportion to that.<br/>
There was also the self-proclaimed third wife, so perhaps there would really be seven people in the end……Thinking a bit of his own future that he had never even imagined, Kousuke shivered slightly.<br/>
He had no self-confidence at all that it would go well like a certain demon king.<br/>
Though that demon king told him 「You can make a clone, so rather, you will be all right even more so than me, right?」 while laughing loudly at him.<br/>
Kousuke thought. ‘That bastard, it’s completely no good to consult him about love relationships’.<br/>
「Now then, there is also the flight schedule, so let’s depart soon.」<br/>
He shouldered his rucksack and exited his room. <br/>
「Wah!? Kou-nii, you were there!?」<br/>
A thin, petite girl jumped from surprise.<br/>
「I’m here. I have been here all this time since morning. We ate breakfast together just now, right?」<br/>
「? Did we? Well, it doesn’t matter.」<br/>
The petite girl who finished the talk with a practiced gesture――Endo Manami. She was Kousuke’s little sister who was wearing glasses with her hair worn in braids.<br/>
She was thirteen years old. She was a first-year middle schooler, and a member of the literary club.<br/>
While she gave off a plain impression, she was a lively girl who would talk briskly.<br/>
「Or rather, Kou-nii. What’s with that luggage?」<br/>
「Aa, I’m thinking of going to Italy for a bit.」<br/>
「Aa, that so. To Italy――wait, why!? Why Italy!? Isn’t that too far to say it in that tone as though you are only going for a bit to a mini market!? Isn’t it too sudden!?」<br/>
Manami-chan made a splendid tsukkomi while fixing her glasses’ position.<br/>
There, the door of a nearby room opened, and the face of a young man wearing glasses popped out.<br/>
「Manami? What are you doing getting noisy by yourself?」<br/>
「She ain’t alone. I’m here. I’ll punch you, you know, Anikibig brother.」<br/>
‘Ah, so you’re there……’ The one who was making a face like that was Endo Sousuke. The big brother of Kousuke who came of age this year. A university student who belonged in a law school.<br/>
When going on a family trip or the like, the Endo family was often thought only to have an older brother and a younger sister, but that was surely the fault of the glasses without a doubt, Kousuke thought.<br/>
As a test, Kousuke tried buying fashion glasses from a 100-yen store and put it on, and it wasn’t like he didn’t feel that the rate of him being perceived by the surrounding was higher than usual, but he was loudly laughed at by his little sister that the glasses absolutely didn’t suit him on a destructive level, so since then he stopped wearing it.<br/>
Kousuke’s little sister and big brother were conversing 「Kou-nii said that he is going to Italy!」「Eh? When?」「Now!」「Haa!? That’s too far when the mood is like ‘I’m going to a mini market for a bit!’ isn’t it!? Isn’t that too sudden!?」 that caused a déjà vu feeling to appear. Kousuke was listening to it while going down to the living room.<br/>
「Tou-san, you’ve got time?」<br/>
「H~mm♪ Hm hm~m♪」<br/>
A middle-aged man was lining up a set of fishing rods on the floor of the living room while maintaining them in a good mood――Kousuke Eiji. He was 49 years old, and a father who was working in the city hall’s population department. By the way, his hobby was fishing, and he had a suntan like a certain swarthy actor ○suo-san who got mentioned a lot in a certain gag. (TN: I don’t get the gag reference at all here. But about the actor, search for Tatsuo Umemiya.)<br/>
Tatsu○-san――not, Eiji didn’t even notice that he was called by his son and continued to maintain his fishing rods diligently.<br/>
It was always like this, so Kousuke shook his father’s shoulder and called to him once more.<br/>
「Oou!? What is――wait, Kousuke huh. What’s up, why are you carrying luggage like that? Are you going out?」<br/>
Even though he twitched from surprise, seeing his son standing beside him, Eiji tilted his head in puzzlement as though nothing happened.<br/>
Kousuke also didn’t really say anything about it in a practiced response and continued his words normally.<br/>
「Yep. I’ll be going to Italy for a bit, so I want Tou-san to take me to the airport by car.」<br/>
「Aa, to Italy huh. Got it, got it. Wait a bit――wait, really wait!? Italy!? You mean Italy, that country with delicious pizza!? Isn’t it too far when your tone feels like you are just going to a mini market!?」<br/>
The father got into the talk following the mood the longest, but the content of his tsukkomi also caused a déjà vu.<br/>
Hearing Eiji’s voice, the mother of Kousuke who was glaring at the household account book on the dining table――Endo Misato raised her face abruptly.<br/>
「Dear, don’t speak so loudly so suddenly like that. You will cause me to make a mistake in the calculations here. Something like Italian or pizza……something like pizza is no good. Even just a medium size is more than 2000 yen, you know? Recently, there are a lot of promos about buy one get two, but even so, I won’t allow such a luxury on an ordinary day where we aren’t celebrating anything!」<br/>
Misato-okaasan (49 years old) sharply pushed on her glasses while showing a firm rejection. She was working in the municipal tax of the city hall. She was strict with money.<br/>
「That’s not it, Misato. It’s Kousuke, you see. He said that he is going to Italy right now.」<br/>
「Eh? Kousuke? Rather, Italy!? Right now!? What are you saying as though you are just going to a nearby mini market!? It’s just too sudden, right!?」<br/>
Perhaps the Endo family had an extraordinary interest in a mini market.<br/>
Around that time Sousuke and Manami also came down to the living room, the whole family pressed the question of what Kousuke was planning to do.<br/>
Kousuke often got forgotten, but his family’s love for him was genuine. Even though they were getting used to him repeatedly going afar unexpectedly, he had already been missing once in the past. They would worry about him no matter what.<br/>
Kousuke smiled wryly while explaining that he would go to investigate something for a bit because of the demon king――Hajime’s request. Like usual, the request fee had already been transferred to him to a certain degree, no, for Kousuke who had the sensibility of common folk, it was an amount that made him shudder. Anyway, he told his family that there was no worry about the travel expense.<br/>
「Nuu, so it’s Nagumo-senpai again……」<br/>
Manami let out a conflicted groan with a somewhat conflicted expression. For her, the demon king Hajime was her sworn enemy.<br/>
Why?<br/>
Changing the topic slightly, Amanogawa Kouki had a little sister. She was close to Shizuku since her childhood. She was idolizing Shizuku very much.<br/>
In other words, she was a soul sister.<br/>
And then, that little sister was the same age as Manami. They were friends that went to the same school.<br/>
In other words, she was a soul sister.<br/>
But why was Manami only showing a conflicted expression instead of a clear hostility like a certain kouhai-chan? That was because she had seen the sight of that certain kouhai-chan recklessly charging at the demon king Hajime when he would be thoroughly getting affectionate with her before carelessly tossing her away like an empty can or tying her on something.<br/>
……It was a secret that she felt her heart beating slightly faster seeing such a sight. Manami-chan of the Endo family might have the same disposition as a certain disappointing dragon.<br/>
Sousuke was also making a similar conflicted expression like Manami and spoke.<br/>
「……That’s, will you be all right? Before this too, there was the major disaster at Britain, right?」<br/>
「Yes, well, it was terrible though. At that time, because of Nagumo’s request, I destroyed an occult organization that tried to lay their hands on us. But after that, I poked my nose into the Berserk incident on my own decision, so it was me reaping what I sow about the terrible experience.」<br/>
「But still. ……Tou-san is grateful to Nagumo-kun, but……even if this is his request……Kousuke, even though you finally came home safely, aren’t you getting involved with dangerous things a bit too much?」<br/>
As a father, such an opinion was only natural. Although she wasn’t saying anything, it was clear from her expression that Misato was also thinking of the same thing.<br/>
Kousuke loosened his expression slightly seeing his parents worrying for him. However, he spoke with a determined tone.<br/>
「Certainly, I also thought just what I’m doing after I finally came home and have even decided my future aim. But, I have learned from Tortus. ――The unreasonableness won’t give a second thought about our convenience or anything. If you want to have your own way in your own convenience, you mustn’t back away.」<br/>
「Kousuke……」<br/>
While he was their own child, Eiji and Misato were always worrying about Kousuke whose inconspicuousness and thin presence reached a pitiful degree thinking 「Why?」 their son had to be like that.<br/>
Even them, his own family, would sometimes put him outside of their own awareness. For a time, they wondered if it was something like a curse and even made Kousuke receive an exorcism. They were grasping at straws then.<br/>
But when they were looking at the figure of their child who was gazing at them with a strong determination that caused them to hold their breath spontaneously, it caused them to think that perhaps Kousuke was already independent of his parents.<br/>
No, actually, they had understood it since he came home.<br/>
That the fierce experience in the other world had turned their son into an adult. Even if it was something that their hand couldn’t reach, Kousuke alone, or perhaps together with his comrades, had already become able to accomplish anything.<br/>
Eiji and Misato’s atmosphere became somewhat solemn. And then seeing that her big brother would go far away, Manami who was making a slightly lonely expression closed her mouth. The living room became quiet; however, the eldest son broke the silence 「Keh」 somehow peevishly.<br/>
「It doesn’t really matter anyway where Kousuke will go and what he will do. After all, he is just going to cajole some beautiful girl or woman again anyway!」<br/>
「A, aniki? Are you, sulking?」<br/>
「Shut up! Don’t you understand your Nii-chan’s feelings!? My feelings when my little brother introduced his lover to me, a transcendentally beautiful Onee-san and a genuine bunny girl! What’s more, this bastard, a few months after that introduction it was a younger blonde-haired beautiful girl and a cool beauty who is an active duty investigator!? Is it a harem!? It’s a harem, isn’t it, this bastard!」<br/>
「N, no, Emily and Vanessa are, still not like……」<br/>
「Still! You said still just now, this damn asshole-. Even at this time, it will be just like Rana-san said anyway. You are going to get one more of your seven wives who are somewhere in the world, right!? Nii-chan will breakdown mentally if I don’t prepare my heart beforehand, so you can leave and not come home for at least half a year!」<br/>
The glasses university student Sousuke-niisan even now looked like he was going to cry with tears of blood.<br/>
Due to Kousuke and Rana’s request before this, Hajime had called Rana to Earth several times when it was time for a "gate opening".<br/>
In preparation for meeting with Kousuke’s family, Rana learned the Hauria-style secret skill "The – Normal Behavior That is Typically Japanese" with desperation, and she safely got herself accepted as the fiancée of the Endo family’s second son, but……<br/>
To be to the point, Rana was a beauty. She had a style that was genuinely well-proportioned (body 8 times longer than the head), she had splendid twin hills, and while she had the look of a beautiful woman, she also possessed the cuteness of someone playful. There was also her wagging rabbit ears and rabbit tail.<br/>
She was 22 years old, so even from Sousuke’s viewpoint, Rana was a "rabbit-eared Onee-san",<br/>
Such a girl was repressing her Hauria’s nature (chuunibyoueighth-grade syndrome) and greeted Kousuke’s family with a graceful atmosphere like a Yamato Nadeshiko.<br/>
Naturally,<br/>
「The history of not having a girlfriend = the age. Sou-nii is jelly.」<br/>
「You shut up there, little sis!」<br/>
「Last week too he confessed to a senpai in his circle and met an honorable defeat. How sad~」<br/>
「How did you know!?」<br/>
Sousuke-niisan sunk into jealousy and sadness.<br/>
Of course, he understood that his little brother reached where he was as the result of a fierce experience. He properly felt happy for his brother.<br/>
But, however, still.<br/>
If it was just a rabbit-eared Onee-san as a lover, he could still bear it.<br/>
But of all things, his little brother, the damned bastard, brought home a blonde-haired beautiful girl and a cool beauty, and in the end, even the rabbit-eared Onee-san also recognized the two as the second and third wives.<br/>
Putting aside the cool beauty who was a bit strange, the lovable and wholehearted appeal 「I love Kousuke!」 of the blonde-haired beautiful girl, and the appeal of her wish to be accepted by Kousuke’s family too……<br/>
Surely that girl was desperately learning the Japanese language because she was desperately appealing with the Japanese language that was still choppy and awkward. In the middle she would also add a body gesture and hand gesture while flustering greatly; however, she would get teary-eyed because she felt that what she wanted to say didn’t really get conveyed to the other party, but even so, she wouldn’t give up and bravely continued. For Sousuke-niisan, such a girl was exactly in his strike zone.<br/>
Naturally, the source of motivation for such an effort on the girl’s part was wholly because of the depth of her feelings toward his little brother Kousuke though.<br/>
Because of that, the honest and unvarnished feeling of the university student who was unable to make a girlfriend would be 「DAMN IT ALLLLLLLLL-, I’M DEATHLY JEALOUS HEREEEEEEE-」 in response.<br/>
By the way, Eiji and Misato were possessors of an extremely normal Japanese sensibility where it was hard to accept something like having multiple lovers. In addition, they were also extremely pleased with Rana, so it was thought that they would surely show disapproval toward the existence of Emily (+Vanessa), but……<br/>
It seemed that Emily’s panicked figure that was desperately attempting to appeal to Kousuke’s parents shot them right in the heart, and in the end, they completely accepted her.<br/>
Of course, Manami was also accepting of the situation. For Manami who loved reading books and light novels and could be somewhat categorized as an otaku, the real harem of her actual big brother seemed to be a target of her excitement.<br/>
She was especially attached to Vanessa who was an active duty investigator of the national security bureau. It seemed she felt sympathy and admiration for her.<br/>
Kousuke would feel a touch of anxiety when he saw the figure of his little sister whose eyes would sparkle brightly, for some reason, each time Vanessa whispered sneakily into her ear. If by any chance his little sister received a bad influence from DanessaNo good-Vanessa……he was resolved with the preparedness to use even the "Staking the Pride of Villager".<br/>
Back to the topic at hand.<br/>
Kousuke was smiling wryly at the conversation between his big brother and little sister. He then turned his gaze back to Eiji.<br/>
「Well, anyway, it’ll be great if Nagumo takes care of everything, but if that guy told me to "do it", and if it’s something related to my friends and me, then I’ve gotta act.」<br/>
Kousuke acted like it really couldn’t be helped, but a sense of pride and self-confidence could be peeked at somewhere in his expression.<br/>
――The right-hand man of the demon king.<br/>
It was unknown who was the one who started saying that, but it was one of the titles that his comrades fixed on Kousuke. The man who that Nagumo Hajime relied on the most other than his wive~s, because in reality, no matter what kind of situation it was, he would come out with a result before anyone knew it.<br/>
The trust from his comrades and the achievements he accomplished himself gave a sense of self-confidence and pride to Kousuke. His face was without a doubt not that of a child, but the face of a competent man.<br/>
With a small voice, Manami muttered 「If Sou-nii could also make that kind of face, he would be able to make at least one girlfriend, and yet」, 「I can hear you, you know? ……Whe, when I become a working adult, even I can」 while Sousuke muttered such a thing. Eiji and Misato glanced at the two briefly before they looked at each other with a wry smile. They then nodded to each other.<br/>
「Got it. Airport, right? Let’s go right away. You already got a plane?」<br/>
「I ordered it on the internet already. There are still three hours left, so we will make it in time if we depart now.」<br/>
Eiji asked while tidying up his fishing set. Kousuke thanked his father while answering.<br/>
「If that’s the case, then Okaa-san will also get to see you off.」<br/>
「Ah, then me too! Kou-nii is going to Italy alone, so let’s go somewhere too when we go home!」<br/>
「Kousuke. Give some pocket money to your pitiful Nii-chan.」<br/>
Misato and Manami immediately started preparing. And then, Sousuke-niisan, who immediately threw away his pride, pestered for some pocket money.<br/>
Kousuke had already left some money for his family from the payment he earned from the demon king’s request, so he ignored his big brother.<br/>
Like that, the Endo family finished their preparations together and boarded their family car that had the loan they still hadn’t finished paying off on, then……<br/>
*kyuru kyuru kyuru kyuru-*<br/>
「Eh? Strange……」<br/>
The engine of the Endo family car wouldn’t start. Sousuke-niisan pondered and spoke.<br/>
「Perhaps the battery ran out? It got used a lot for the light and heating when fishing yesterday.」<br/>
「H~m, I think that it should be fine though.」<br/>
The engine wouldn’t start no matter how many times Eiji tried to turn the key. Eiji came out of the car and opened the car hood. Manami who also came out suddenly turned her gaze after hearing a sound that pierced the ear and got taken aback.<br/>
*Kaaa! Kaaa! Kaaa!*<br/>
「Wai-, isn’t there a lot of crows there? It’s scary……」<br/>
「Uwah, it’s unpleasant.」<br/>
When Kousuke also looked up like the others, he saw a lot of crows flying around. Even though the weather wasn’t cloudy and it also wasn’t evening, the sky looked somewhat gloomy.<br/>
「Hey, dear. How about trying to charge the battery from my car?」<br/>
「I guess……. Wait for a bit. I’ll bring the cable now.」<br/>
Eiji walked behind the Endo family car to take out the toolbox. Then, as he was traversing there……<br/>
*Nyaa~~*<br/>
「……A black cat.」<br/>
A black cat was staring fixedly at Endo papa, and then it purred once more before running away.<br/>
「Say, how about we just go using Kaa-san’s car? It will be a bit cramped, but I won’t be there on the return trip anyway.」<br/>
Kousuke did his best to calm his heart while giving a suggestion in order to depart quickly.<br/>
Thinking that his suggestion had merit, Eiji looked toward Misato. Misato nodded and put her hand on the door of her compact car. And then,<br/>
「Eh? No way-, the wheel is deflated!」<br/>
Looking closer, one of the front wheels had become flat. It seemed it had stepped on something and throughout last night the air came out from it.<br/>
「Ee……wait a second. Why are all of our transportation methods getting total annihilated――」<br/>
‘At this timing!’ Surely Kousuke was going to say that.<br/>
However, his words were interrupted.<br/>
By the sound of a *snap-*.<br/>
Everyone’s gazes were directed at the source of the sound――at the feet of Kousuke.<br/>
They splendidly snapped. The shoe strings. Both of the shoes.<br/>
「「「「「……」」」」」<br/>
――*Kaaaa! Kaaaa! Kaaaa!*<br/>
――*Nyaaa~~*<br/>
Manami spoke to Kousuke with a relatively grave expression.<br/>
「……Kou-nii. Are you going to die?」<br/>
If Kousuke departed like this…<br/>
Cold sweat was trickling from Kousuke’s forehead.<br/>
Eiji, Misato, and then Sousuke too, they were sending him an expression that seemed to want to say 「As expected, just cancel it!」.<br/>
Kousuke silently made his Treasure Warehouse shine. What came out were his spare shoes. This time it wasn’t the type that used shoestrings, but a belt type shoes.<br/>
「Hey, Kousuke――」<br/>
「Don’t say it, Tou-san. Unreasonableness, has to be fought against without backing away!」<br/>
――*Kaaaa! Kaaaa! Kaaaa!*<br/>
――*Nyaaa~~*<br/>
――*Gurururururu-*<br/>
No, this wasn’t a talk about unreasonableness anymore……<br/>
Ignoring his family who seemed to want to say that, Kousuke straddled Misato’s granny bike with a severe expression.<br/>
And then,<br/>
「Then, I’m going!」<br/>
Kousuke dashed away on the granny bike while doing a wheelie from the momentum. While the countless crows and black cats, and then some stray dogs that were there, when they noticed were crying out, a strangely sticky wind was blowing with Kousuke’s departure.<br/>
Most likely, by making use of his thin shadow that wouldn’t be perceived by anyone, midway through Kousuke would surely rampage by doing an "E.T" and the like, so even though he wasn’t using a car, he would make it just barely in time to the airport.<br/>
「Kou-nii, will he be really fine?」<br/>
The hero who started his excessively ominous journey on a granny bike……<br/>
In response to Manami’s anxious voice, Eiji, Misato, and Sousuke nodded in agreement.<br/>

AN: Thank you very much for reading this every time.<br/>
Thank you very much too for the thoughts, opinions, and reports about misspelling and omitted words.<br/>
This is the beginning of the Abyss Lord’s Vatican chapter.<br/>
Although, honestly I have no confidence that I will be able to write it as strongly as the previous times.<br/>
And so, I’m thinking about writing the story in about ten chapters similar to the shape of a long part within the After.<br/>
Best regards!<br/>
