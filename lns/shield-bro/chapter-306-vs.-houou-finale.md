VS Houou Final<br/>
The shield was very simple but it felt as warm and tender as the sunlight.<br/>
Its stats are the highest of any of my unlocked shields.<br/>
On top of that, this shield’s effect has the ability to give enchantments.<br/>
My defence is rising endlessly.<br/>
And… the Slave, Demi-human and Companion series have all been completely unsealed.<br/>
This includes all of their bonuses.<br/>
In other words, all of my slaves and companions had all their abilities dramatically increased.<br/>
I change to my usual Spirit Turtle Shell.<br/>
Growing Power has been activated by Growth Up!<br/>
Spirit Turtle Shell had changed!<br/>
Increasing it any further is unnecessary.<br/>
Right now I can’t afford to wait and see if it grants any bonuses.<br/>
Everyone here had miraculously finished their treatment.<br/>
The Healers are all treating it like a miracle.<br/>
…But.<br/>
As I leave the tent I look to the sky, and see the pests.<br/>
"Kyuuiiiiii!"<br/>
What an annoying pest.<br/>
Right now I don’t feel like dealing with it.<br/>
But because it is still here, the fight won’t end and there won’t be any peace.<br/>
Then there is only one thing I can do.<br/>
Naofumi: "Firo!"<br/>
I call Firo who was dealing with the pests with another party.<br/>
Firo: "Yes?…"<br/>
Taking a look at my face, Firo who was worried about Atlas’ condition came down with a sad look.<br/>
Until now, I never realized how kind Firo was.<br/>
I wasn’t sure if it was due to Atlas or the Shield of Compassion.<br/>
It wasn’t just hate, there was also feelings of kindness… both emotions were conflicting within my heart.<br/>
But I don’t believe what I’m feeling now is due to the shield’s effect.<br/>
Naofumi: "Take me up higher than that bastard"<br/>
Firo: "Okay…I can do that"<br/>
Naofumi: "Ah, Lets hurry up and end this!"<br/>
Riding on Firo’s back, we fly through the vermin while maintaining a high altitude.<br/>
Naofumi: "Firo, time this just right"<br/>
Firo: "Yes"<br/>
"Kyuuiiiiii"<br/>
The pests notice us and come to attack us with their claws.<br/>
To remain calm and collected would be best.<br/>
To hate the enemy in front of me, would just cloud my judgement.<br/>
However I understand the pain.<br/>
I can see how unreasonable this world is.<br/>
The wounds that were suffered… and the sorrow for the lives that were lost.<br/>
But even though I know this, I mustn’t get angry.<br/>
Naofumi: "Too noisy"<br/>
I catch the pests by their talons and throw them towards the ground.<br/>
"Kyuiii!?"<br/>
As we gain altitude the pests turn towards to swarms us.<br/>
Naofumi: "Firo, kick them"<br/>
Firo: "Y-yes"<br/>
Following my instructions, Firo lands a hit and the pests fall straight down.<br/>
It made a great noise.<br/>
Shortly after, I jump off Firo towards the pests.<br/>
Firo: "Master!?"<br/>
Naofumi:"Firo, I’m fine, but get ready to catch me when I fall"<br/>
Firo: "Y-yes"<br/>
I give Firo those instructions as I activate Gravity Field.<br/>
Before it wasn’t that effective, but as it is now I can use it.<br/>
"Kyu…Kyuiii!"<br/>
The pests desperately try to remain airborne but under the new weight there was no way they could maintain altitude.<br/>
I begin to fall towards the pests that are at a lower altitude.<br/>
Naofumi:"Firo!"<br/>
I jump before I hit the ground, and was caught by Firo.<br/>
I grab two pests as I reach the battlefield and make a declaration.<br/>
Naofumi: "Everyone! Let do this!"<br/>
Fohl: "Nao-Naofumi!?"<br/>
Naofumi: "What are you doing? Lets hurry up and kill it"<br/>
Fohl: "I understand! Tiger Break!"<br/>
It was Fohl who acted first.<br/>
I expected as much.<br/>
Right now I can understand his feelings more than anyone else…as well as his thoughts.<br/>
Of course I don’t know what it is like to lose a family member.<br/>
But, I knew what kind of girl Atlas was.<br/>
Naofumi: "Don’t worry about me. Let us finish this as soon as possible. Soon we will kill it!"<br/>
Everyone: "OHH!"<br/>
The Party, who was surprised at my words, stated to unleash their special attacks.<br/>
Ren: "Naofumi, how is Atlas…"<br/>
Ren came to ask me in-between attacks.<br/>
Naofumi: "…"<br/>
I look away in silence.<br/>
Right now, I don’t want to think about it.<br/>
Naofumi: "Kuh…"<br/>
Though unintentional, I let out a pained voice.<br/>
Along with the power from the Sword, we strengthen the forces.<br/>
Kiel: "My body feels…so light!"<br/>
Kiel rushes out and bites through the pests.<br/>
Kiel: "Yes. It seems like my speed is different than before."<br/>
There is a visible difference in the movement of my slaves and the military forces, as well as their attacks.<br/>
It must be due to the bonuses of the completed Slave and Companion series.<br/>
I didn’t check it but there must have been a huge boost.<br/>
And, it was all thanks to Atlas.<br/>
Naofumi: "Hurry. Lets end it quickly. For all of the pain and sorrow it has caused… we need to destroy it, even by a single second faster."<br/>
The two pests try to attack me but it doesn’t hurt or bother me.<br/>
Their claws and bites are pointless.<br/>
If all the enemies are gathered in one place, they can all be eliminated easily.<br/>
Ren: "Gravity Sword!"<br/>
Motoyasu: "Brionac!"<br/>
Itsuki: "Bird Hunting!"<br/>
Rishia: "Tornado Throw!"<br/>
Raphtalia: "Bagua Karma Blade"<br/>
Firo: "Spiral Strike!"<br/>
The swarm of pests are hit by the sheer power of their special attacks.<br/>
"Kyuuiiiiii!"<br/>
As one lets out its death cry, the other begins to make a strange noise.<br/>
So it is going to self-destruct.<br/>
Of course, you won’t have the chance to use it.<br/>
Fohl: "Tiger Rampage!"<br/>
With Fohl’s deadly strike, the enemy was wiped out leaving nothing but a pile of feathers.<br/>
Everyone: "OOOOHHHHHHH!"<br/>
The roar of victory echoed throughout the area.<br/>
Feathers float down like snow and calmly settle.<br/>
Naofumi: "Atlas…we did it"<br/>
I raise up my Shield to signal our victory.<br/>
The truth is that we should have won without any sacrifices.<br/>
I will never… never forgive that guy.<br/>
Naofumi: "Ren! You understand what’s next, right?"<br/>
Ren: "Ah!"<br/>
Naofumi: "Inform the Queen. I need to make that bastard pay! I can never forgive him!"<br/>
It is very likely that he was a Seven Star Hero.<br/>
I have to find out who was responsible!<br/>
I called Firo and left to look for the source of that flash of light.<br/>
Ren also came along while riding Gaelion.<br/>
But even though we searched all day, we could not find the culprit of that attack.<br/>
Naofumi: "Damn it! Where did he disappear to!"<br/>
Ren: "Looking for him anymore is pointless. Naofumi please go on ahead and rest."<br/>
Ren came and told me this.<br/>
Naofumi: "What are you saying!"<br/>
Ren: "I’ll call you if I find something. So please bear with it for now."<br/>
Naofumi: "But-"<br/>
Ren: "Please…"<br/>
Before I could argue, Ren pleaded with me.<br/>
His expression was mixed with both sadness and anger.<br/>
Ren: "Naofumi, you are are not the only one who is mad. I am also filled with rage"<br/>
Naofumi: "…I see"<br/>
Ren: "Naofumi you are the only one I have told this to. Earlier I unsealed the Sword of Rage, of course I haven’t used it, since at that time I was surprised at how you were behaving."<br/>
Naofumi: "…"<br/>
Ren: "I don’t intent to forgive the culprit either. But, you need some time to calm down."<br/>
It true…I need time to calm down.<br/>
I was under the illusion that I was calm but in reality I was filled with anger.<br/>
What I am feeling right now…can’t easily be described.<br/>
When I was betrayed by Witch, my head was filled with anger.<br/>
Right now I should rest for a bit.<br/>
I need to calm down so I can differentiate who my enemies are and who it is I should protect.<br/>
Yes, I need to calm down the feelings in heart.<br/>
Naofumi: "…I understand. I will leave the rest to you."<br/>
I sit down at the temple as the day was ending.<br/>
The search is still ongoing.<br/>
While I was resting, like Ren asked me to, I became aware of how angry I was.<br/>
By changing to the Shield of Compassion, my anger begins to fade.<br/>
But even so it was something I could not forgive.<br/>
That is because I can understand it…the unreasonable sorrow and suffering.<br/>
After the feelings of anger had calmed down, a sense of loss had filled my heart and dominated my mind.<br/>
Raphtalia stood by me before I could notice.<br/>
Raphtalia: "Atlas-san… that was unfair. I wanted to have Naofumi-sama turn around with my own power…"<br/>
Naofumi: "I see…but right now…"<br/>
Raphtalia: "I know. I understand completely…so it is okay for you to cry"<br/>
But, Raphtalia is probably the one who wants to cry the most.<br/>
The pain of losing someone, such a feeling was represented by tears.<br/>
Naofumi: "I am not going to cry"<br/>
I noticed something along my cheeks when I said that.<br/>
Is this…tears?<br/>
Since I had left the tent, I was unaware of it, but I was crying.<br/>
And…everyone else may have noticed.<br/>
I was crying.<br/>
Naofumi: "Uuh…"<br/>
Once I became aware of it, it was the only thing I could think about.<br/>
Raphtalia: "Naofumi-sama…"<br/>
I had unconsciously hugged Raphtalia and burst into tears.<br/>
After my duel at the castle, I decided to stop crying.<br/>
The tears won’t stop.<br/>
My tears start to overflow when I try to stop.<br/>
This was the pain and sorrow of losing someone, that I knew.<br/>
It wasn’t something shameful, I realize this now.<br/>
More than anything… for the feelings of the girl who became my shield…I just wanted to silently cry.<br/>
