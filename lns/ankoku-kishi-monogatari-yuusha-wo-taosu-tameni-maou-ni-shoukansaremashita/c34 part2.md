Chapter 34.2 : Ogre-ruled Land<br/>
The girl is saying so while bowing lightly.<br/>
Such a brave girl. She makes me want to take her in as my possession without offering her to Zengu-sama.<br/>
This country is under the supervision of a certain ogre called Zengu. The citizens of this country are livestock for the ogre.<br/>
And this girl has been chosen to become the offering for the said Zengu.<br/>
Zengu ordered me to choose a girl as a birthday gift for his mother. He told me to choose a healthy one, rather than a fleshy and beautiful one.<br/>
Though I want to choose an ugly girl, my life will be in jeopardy if I lose the favor of Zengu. That’s why, I really am regretting the fact that this brave girl is about to die.<br/>
「Echigos-sama!」<br/>

<br/>
Another one is coming.<br/>
「You’re noisy, what is it now?」<br/>
The one who came is my subordinate.<br/>
「Travelers! Three girls just came! They are quite beautiful, too」<br/>
Beautiful girls.<br/>
I couldn’t let that word pass.<br/>
「Travelers, huh… Guide me to meet them」<br/>
I went along with my subordinates to meet those girls.<br/>
Thus, when I met those girls-<br/>
「Hou…」<br/>
I unintentionally let out an admiring voice. They’re the most beautiful women I’ve ever met.<br/>
It seems the proud looking woman in the middle is their leader. She’s wearing the finest quality garment, so she might be the princess of a country.<br/>

<br/>
<br/>
I want to keep these woman in this country.<br/>
And then, behind those three are definitely hippogriffs.<br/>
I heard that it’s possible to tame the demon beasts, a long time ago, but I never expected to see a tamed hippogriff.<br/>
They might have bought a reared hippogriff.<br/>
In any case, this hippogriff isn’t hostile to humans.<br/>
I must be lucky for getting my hands on the finest women along with the tamed hippogriffs.<br/>
「We’re travelers. May we stay here for one night? Naturally, we’re going to pay for our stay」<br/>
The woman on the left started to negotiate.<br/>
「No, no, no, don’t mind such things. If it pleases you, feel free to stay in my house」<br/>
I replied so.<br/>

     (adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({});<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
It’s natural since I’m going to strip them of all their possessions. Thus, I don’t need any rewards right now.<br/>
I looked at those three like a hunter looks at their game while pretending to be calm.<br/>
「Well, this way, please. Since that demon beast is going to stay in the barn, I’m going to take him there later」<br/>
When I was about to guide those three to a residence.<br/>
「No, it’s good as long as we can stay in the same place. Please guide us there」<br/>
The woman on the left asked me to guide them to the barn.<br/>
With only straws for a bed, the barn is far from enough as a residence for humans. I’m wondering why I felt chills running down my spine when I heard the voice of this maid.<br/>
「Y… Yes, this way then」<br/>
Thus, I guided them to the barn while thinking about that matter.<br/>
After guiding them to the barn, I gathered my subordinates to ambush them.<br/>
The one we should place our utmost attention on would be the woman carrying a sword with her hair tied to the back. [TL: Shirone with her ponytail] She must be talented to be able to become the bodyguard of a woman with such high standing.<br/>
「Don’t you think it’s about time to enter, Echigos?」<br/>
A voice was calling from behind.<br/>

<br/>
<br/>
When I turned around, the one who spoke was a man carrying a large sword. He has a brawny body with muscles bulging at various parts of his body and a pair of canines protruding out from his mouth. No matter how you look at him, he’s such a barbaric man.<br/>
And this man is also another reason why there are no demons invading this country.<br/>
「So it is Daigan-sama. It’s as you say, they’re the finest quality gems」<br/>
「Tricking some women and then ambushing them when they’re being careless, huh?」<br/>
「Yes, naturally that’s my plan. GUFUFUFU」<br/>
「Kukuku, Echigos, even the evil me has lost to you」<br/>
「Nonono, I’m still far away from Daigan-sama’s level. Gufufufufu」<br/>
Daigan is laughing.<br/>
That’s right. As long as we have this man, we have nothing to fear.<br/>
I was caught by Zengu the ogre when I was traveling as a merchant.<br/>
But then, by using my ass kissing skills on him, I somehow ended up as the landlord of this place in which Zengu raises the humans inside as his livestock.<br/>
For the sake of successfully raising the human livestock in this place, Zengu lent Daigan to me.<br/>

     (adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({});<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
The people of this country obey me because of their fear of Daigan.<br/>
Even though I’m just a merchant, I’m something like the king of this country now. I can do anything as long as I use Zengu’s power.<br/>
Much less to say when the other party is composed of merely three frail girls, so what do I have to be afraid of?<br/>
What I’m afraid of is that we might injure the girls when we capture them.<br/>
Moreover, I’ll have my way with one of them before offering her to Zengu.<br/>
I unintentionally wanted to laugh.<br/>
◆Governor Echigos<br/>
「Echigos-sama. Those women are inside the barn」<br/>
I receive a report from one of the guards.<br/>
There are fifty armed men in my surroundings.<br/>
Though this number seemingly looks overkill just to capture three women, it’s logical to use such huge manpower since my goal is to capture them without any resistance by showing our overwhelming numbers.<br/>
Well then, how should we break into the barn?<br/>
But the door of the barn was opened before we barged in.<br/>
Standing there were the three women who hadn’t changed at all since we met a while ago. In short, they’re still armed.<br/>
「At the very least, we need to hear your reason to do this」<br/>
The lordly woman, their leader, is asking so.<br/>
Well, what answer should I give them then?<br/>
「M-My daughter will be saved as long as you become her substitute! Sorry, but please become her replacement!」<br/>
When I’m wondering what to say, the man who prostrated in front of me previously replied ahead instead of me.<br/>
Those three women exchanged glances when they heard his words. And then, they’re seemingly consulting about something.<br/>
「It seems you have some sort of circumstance. Do tell us your story」<br/>
Maybe because they heard that man’s story, the lordly woman is asking again.<br/>
But, I have no intention to continue such useless storytelling anymore.<br/>
「Regardless of our circumstances, she’s incomparable to you, young ladies. How about putting down your weapons? We won’t hurt you as long as you surrender to us」<br/>
I give them my warning.<br/>
Why in the hell are they asking for our story anyway? No human can beat the ogre.<br/>
As long as they are obedient, I’ll let them have a good time before offering them to Zengu.<br/>
I look at those women while having such indecent thoughts. Thereupon, the woman holding a sword in her hand is glaring at me.<br/>
I almost stumbled back unable to support my body after seeing the glint in her eyes.<br/>
「W-we’re going to use violence if you resist, you know!」<br/>
Those women don’t seem to have changed their attitudes after my warning. Why can they stay calm despite being surrounded by so many people?<br/>
「Doesn’t matter! Catch them!!」<br/>
On my command, my subordinates approach those girls.<br/>
「It seems there are some people who can’t be reasoned with unless they experience some pain, huh? Kaya! Shirone-san! Let’s teach them a lesson!」<br/>
The haughty woman nods to the women on her sides while saying so.<br/>
「Young lady. Please refrain from any overwhelming actions」<br/>
「Indeed you must restrain yourself, Kyouka-san」<br/>
Yup, the woman on her sides were most likely her attendants. And just like that, the proud-looking woman in the middle steps back.<br/>
The woman on the left is making a stance with her fist, while the woman on the right is making a stance with her sword.<br/>
Five of my subordinates are going for the left one.<br/>
「You choose the painful wa-… EH? 」<br/>
I doubted what my eyes showed me.<br/>
Those five men have already fallen without making any sound. The men are rolling on the ground while growling in pain.<br/>
「UWAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA!!」<br/>
Someone is suddenly screaming on my right.<br/>
When I look at that direction, the men who tried to catch the woman on the right have already fallen on their asses. Some even fainted.<br/>
Their ropes and weapons have already been shredded to pieces.<br/>
Looking closely, that’s not the only things shredded to pieces. Their hair is gone, too.<br/>
Since I didn’t have any bald subordinates, their hair might have been shredded just at this moment. What speed!<br/>
The rest of my subordinates are already cowering in fear due to those scenes.<br/>
「HEY! WHAT ARE YOU DOING! THERE’S ONLY THREE OF THEM! DO YOU WANT TO BECOME OGRE FOOD! CATCH THEM!」<br/>
I look at my subordinates while shouting at them.<br/>
They’re rolling on the ground like the first ones who tried and ended up as a group of bald people.<br/>
These women are strong.<br/>
Even I am starting to fear their power.<br/>
「Step back, Echigos. Let me do this」<br/>
「Daigan-sama…」<br/>
My subordinates are retreating.<br/>
「You’re quite strong, huh. Let this one be your opponent」<br/>
After saying so, Daigan’s body starts swelling up.<br/>
His already tall body frame becomes taller. Bristles appear from his body; his face and mouth start growing forward.<br/>
「Werewolf!」<br/>
The woman with the sword cried in shock.<br/>
Daigan’s true identity is that of a werewolf. Zengu the ogre sent him to this country in order to protect the humans in this country who have been domesticated by me.<br/>
This Daigan was already trained by those ogres to not touch the human livestock of the ogre.<br/>
But, his physical prowess as a therianthrope is the real deal. No matter how talented a human is, they won’t be able to beat him.<br/>
「Hoo, a werewolf, huh. Well then, let me become your opponent」<br/>
The woman with the sword is preparing her stance with a calm face. Even when she’s facing a werewolf, her expression is far from fear, she rather seems to be enjoying this instead.<br/>
Her attitude angers Daigan.<br/>
「LITTLE GIRL! DON’T MAKE FUN OF ME!!」<br/>
Daigan attacks with his sword.<br/>
I panic after seeing that. He must not kill them. Maybe because she’s unable to move, she does not show any sign of trying to guard against the incoming sword.<br/>
「… EH?」<br/>
Suddenly, Daigan lets out an exaggerated voice.<br/>
I also can’t believe what I am seeing. The sword in Daigan’s grip… Is gone.<br/>
Looking closely, his hands are still gripping the handle of his sword. The sword has not been unsheathed from the sheath on his back.<br/>
「I-IMPOSSIBLE!? WHEN DID YOU!!?」<br/>
Daigan became flustered.<br/>
There’s no blood spurting from the bisected part of his arms, it’s raising a trail of smoke instead. The sword of that woman is wrapped in flames.<br/>
「Still want to try?」<br/>
The woman with the sword asks again. Though she’s smiling at us, her eyes don’t seem to be smiling at all.<br/>
「KYAAAIN!」<br/>
Daigan got cold feet and tried to escape. But, he fell before even that. Now, his left foot is gone. Just when did she slice his left foot?<br/>
「KYAAAIN! KYAAAAIN! HYIIIII, MY HANDS, MY FOOT!!」<br/>
Daigan is wailing and rolling on the ground in such an unsightly manner.<br/>
「Who the hell are you guys…」<br/>
I’m muttering so. Their power is abnormal.<br/>
「GIVE IT UP! GUYS!」<br/>
The woman who was using her fists to fight suddenly shouted in a loud voice.<br/>
「GIVE IT UP! YOU PEOPLE, WHO DO YOU THINK THE PERSON YOU’RE TRYING TO ATTACK IS? THIS PERSON’S NAME IS KYOUKA, THE KIN OF REIJI-SAMA, THE HERO OF LIGHT! SHE’S YOUR PRINCESS! YOU PEASANTS SHOULD JUST GIVE UP!!」<br/>
I’m shocked by what that woman said.<br/>
The hero’s… Little sister.<br/>
I did hear the rumors about the hero. The man had dived deep into Nargol where demons far more terrible than the ogre were waiting to kill him.<br/>
Quite the haughty man who won’t forgive anyone who becomes his enemy.<br/>
Even though the demon king wasn’t defeated since he got his ass kicked by the dark knight, one can measure the height of his power by seeing how he can get so far to the point of reaching the demon king castle.<br/>
And, I heard that the hero had already recovered. And if this woman is the little sister of the hero, my life might be in jeopardy if I were to attack her.<br/>
No, even without that, these women are freaking powerful. We’re absolutely no match for them.<br/>
「Haha~~~!」<br/>
I prostrate in front of that woman called Kyouka. The other men also do the same.<br/>
I’ll submit to the strong till the very end. That is my raison d’etre.<br/>
「I never knew that you’re the little sister of the hero! PLEASE FORGIVE MEEEEーーー！ ! 」<br/>
◆Sword Maiden, Shirone<br/>
We are currently sauntering under the moonlight.<br/>
We’re heading for the castle, the living place of the ogre Zengu.<br/>
Basically, an ogre lives in the mountain and built its castle or palace there.<br/>
Even though it looks like a castle from the human’s perspective, it’s nothing more than a mansion for the ogre due to their huge build.<br/>
Being able to build a castle means that they have considerably high technology. Some of them even excel in magic. High physical power along with magical power, so speaking of their latent potential, no need to say about humans, even the elves can’t match them.<br/>
But in comparison to their power, they’re fairly stupid, it seems they fall behind the humans in terms of wisdom. There’s a story about a stupid ogre whose castle was seized after being tricked by a cat fairy.<br/>
But fortunately, their numbers are far less than humans. For that reason, the majority of humans are living without being ruled by them.<br/>
But then, this country is ruled by one of those ogres.<br/>
「That’s the place, Kyouka-sama. Zengu mansion」<br/>
Following the directions of Echigos, Kaya is pointing at the mansion on top of a cliff.<br/>
That was a splendid mansion considering that it was built for the ogre.<br/>
