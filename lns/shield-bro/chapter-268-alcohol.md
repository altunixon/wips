Chapter 268: Alcohol<br/>
"There are quite a few more things here than when I last visited." (Naofumi)<br/>
Like a pirate’s treasure cove, Sadina’s secret base is littered with stuff.<br/>
Gold and Silver… aren’t in high quantity, but there seems to be quite a few magical tools.<br/>
It’s probably best to appraise them later.<br/>
Sadina brings back items that seem to be worth money to me, and it looks like these miscellaneous items are left.<br/>
The amount of money her salvaging has brought me is enough to cover the price I bought her for several times over.<br/>
I guess I have to raise my evaluation of her.<br/>
"Now then, today, we’re all drinking until we drop!" (Sadina)<br/>
Sadina declares as she brings out a wine barrel.<br/>
"Fumu… Am I included?" (Gaelion)<br/>
Gaelion asserts his presence in response to the alcohol.<br/>
I’d tell him to go home, but Raphtalia also seems to want to drink as well, which sounds dangerous.<br/>
It’s better to have more drinkers.<br/>
"All green~ here, this is for Gaelion-chan." (Sadina)<br/>
Sadina produces a two liter bottle and hands it to Gaelion.<br/>
(TL: It’s a 1 Sho bottle. 1 Sho is approximately 1.8 liters)<br/>
Um, is that Japanese Sake?<br/>
Perhaps the previous heroes left behind the method to make it.<br/>
"Then without further ado." (Gaelion)<br/>
Gaelion begins drinking straight out of the bottle.<br/>
"Oh… This is quite a choice sake, is it not?" (Gaelion)<br/>
"Yeah~ It’s a good enough, strong sake to please even the dragon from my home town." (Sadina)<br/>
"I see…" (Gaelion)<br/>
Gaelion’s mood improves as he continues to drink.<br/>
And where exactly did you get such a thing…<br/>
"Now, the two of you don’t need to show any restraint. Drink. For Naofumi-chan, I even have some Lucor Fruit." (Sadina)<br/>
Sadina begins offering us alcohol.<br/>
It’s not as if Lucor Fruit is my favorite fruit or anything.<br/>
I guess this is fine.<br/>
"And? What did you want to talk about? You didn’t want Shadow or the others to hear, right?" (Naofumi)<br/>
"Naofumi-chan’s too hasty~ Can you wait until I get a little tipsy? Raphtalia-chan, drink too. Raphtalia’s parents were strong drinkers, so you must be strong too." (Sadina)<br/>
"I-I am…" (Raphtalia)<br/>
Sadina pours some sake into Raphtalia’s cup, and she timidly sips it.<br/>
I think she did drink some alcohol at Cal Mira though.<br/>
I get the feeling that she was quite strong.<br/>
"How does Raphtalia-chan feel about Naofumi-chan? Onee-san wants to know." (Sadina)<br/>
"I have great respect for him." (Raphtalia)<br/>
Is that so?<br/>
She always seems fed up with my evil acts, so I thought she had lost her respect for me.<br/>
It may seem strange coming from me, but many of my actions are quite cruel.<br/>
"Are those your true feelings?" (Sadina)<br/>
"Yes." (Raphtalia)<br/>
"You don’t wanna get hitched or something?" (Sadina)<br/>
"T-that is…" (Raphtalia)<br/>
Eh? Raphtalia wants to marry me? She recognizes me as a member of the opposite sex?<br/>
Nonono, she’s just trying hard to make sure the wave doesn’t leave behind any unfortunate children like her, isn’t she?<br/>
If she said she liked someone like me, I don’t think I would hate it, but I think that there’s something called priorities.<br/>
I remember what Sadina said during the day.<br/>
When the world is at peace, Raphtalia may… start thinking about things like that.<br/>
If we do well, her social status will be high by the time I leave.<br/>
"I am… that is… um…" (Raphtalia)<br/>
Raphtalia’s eyes spin as her face goes red.<br/>
Her real age is still quite low. I don’t think she should really be drinking, and I don’t think she’s at an age where she should be concerned with love yet.<br/>
She only sees me as a replacement for her deceased parents, and she must be confused at being asked how she thinks of me as a member of the opposite sex.<br/>
Yes, it’s still too early for Raphtalia to love.<br/>
It’s like that.<br/>
When Raphtalia felt troubled from misunderstanding the situation where she found others sleeping in my bed, it was the unpleasant feeling and denial one gets when their parents remarry, and the child sees their step-parent. Something like that.<br/>
Even though nothing’s wrong, you still end up feeling nervous and uneasy.<br/>
Even I don’t want Raphtalia to feel like that.<br/>
Ah, but Firo, the Loinclothed Dog, and Imya are all children as well, so perhaps it’s fine?<br/>
"Nyaohyumi-sama isth my…" (Raphtalia)<br/>
Raphtalia’s articulation is getting messed up.<br/>
"Ara? Raphtalia-chan?" (Sadina)<br/>
"Isth my…" (Raphtalia)<br/>
With a bang, Raphtalia falls flat onto the table.<br/>
"Yes… I’m also… a bit…" (Gaelion)<br/>
Gaelion sways side to side and falls on his back with his legs in the air.<br/>
"Well well well. As expected of the wines "Dragon Killer" and "Tanuki", … I guess it was too strong for Raphtalia-chan and Gaelion-chan." (Sadina)<br/>
"You… planned this, didn’t you." (Naofumi)<br/>
This is bad. It seems Sadina prepared special sake to take down both Raphtalia and Gaelion.<br/>
At this rate, this whale woman may assault me.<br/>
Worse comes to worst, I can use Shield Prison and escape with Portal.<br/>
"And so, let’s continue drinking." (Sadina)<br/>
"Don’t want to. I’m going home." (Naofumi)<br/>
"Now, now, this Onee-san has something to talk about, and if you go back, what are you going to do about Raphtalia-chan and Gaelion-chan?" (Sadina)<br/>
"I’ll take them with my Portal." (Naofumi)<br/>
"Ah, that’s right~. But could you leave it ‘til after you chat with this Onee-san?" (Sadian)<br/>
"What talk? It better not be about a carnival of lust." (Naofumi)<br/>
"Wrong, wrong, wrong. Tonight’s really a truce." (Sadian)<br/>
With a relaxing atmosphere, Sadina continues drinking as she always does.<br/>
But, in the next moment…<br/>
"Naofumi-chan, I told you before, right? That if you wanted to get into a further relationship with Raphtalia-chan, you have to be prepared." (Sadina)<br/>
Blowing away the laid back mood, Sadina changes into her human form and stares seriously into my eyes.<br/>
"Yeah, you said that. You knocked out both Raphtalia and Gaelion, and that’s all you have to say?" (Naofumi)<br/>
To Sadina, who is the child known as Raphtalia?<br/>
I don’t really know, and it seems to be something she doesn’t want to bring up. Whenever I inquire about it, she shifts the conversation.<br/>
It was quite a while ago.<br/>
When I was still constructing the village, one of the forces that came to my aid was a group of Raccoon Demi-Humans… The Raccoon race rushed to help me.<br/>
"If the Hero of the Shield’s right arm is a Raccoon, then you’re the same as family to us. Please let us assist in the revival of this village."<br/>
Sometimes, people like these would gather in my village under the pretense of offering aid.<br/>
At that time, I looked over the Raccoon Demi-Humans, and I was surprised at the sharp contrast they had with Raphtalia.<br/>
Should I say they were well built?… To say it bluntly, a large majority of them reeked of the sticks.<br/>
I can’t say they were particularly handsome, and they smelled of earth.<br/>
I also felt that they weren’t particularly motivated.<br/>
But as they were of the Raccoon Race, I couldn’t drive them out so easily. After they saw Raphtalia, they were quite insistent on pressing her for her lineage.<br/>
Eventually, I told them that I didn’t make her my subordinate because of her race, but because of her ability, and that they had no relation to Raphtalia. I tried to get them to leave.<br/>
At that point, Sadina let out the bloodlust she usually concealed and pointed her harpoon at them.<br/>
"I apologize, but the child serving as Naofumi-chan’s right hand is so separated from you people that she might as well be a complete stranger. Using blood relations to close in on this village… could you stop?" (Sadina)<br/>
Though her words were polite, upon sensing her bloodlust, the Raccoons’ legs gave out.<br/>
There, I added on another thing to bring the matter to a close.<br/>
"Well, if you want to help no matter what, then please go work towards reconstruction in the other village. I’ll decide whether or not you’re competent based on your work." (Naofumi)<br/>
And after that, the Raccoon group left for the village, but… I didn’t hear from them later.<br/>
Ah, I remember.<br/>
Three days after they were assigned work, most of them had quietly fled I believe.<br/>
Though, a few of them are still working diligently there, even now.<br/>
The ones who stayed didn’t seem particularly concerned with me.<br/>
"Hey, what’s your relationship with Raphtalia, exactly?" (Naofumi)<br/>
"Naofumi-chan, to me, Raphtalia-chan and her parents were my reason for living." (Sadina)<br/>
