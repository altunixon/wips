Chapter 281: Life Ethics<br/>
Now then, on to the next task.<br/>
At the moment, the Slaves and Monsters are charging their magic through the Castle Plant.<br/>
I’ll use that magic to create a magic amplification device to create even greater magic, and use it to expand my base.<br/>
"Good. Until the expansion is finished, I can devote myself to my own goals." (Naofumi)<br/>
I step foot into the center of the Lab, the area Rat used for her own research.<br/>
"You all should get to work as well. If you need food, then go to the residential area. I have some prepared." (Naofumi)<br/>
"I want to stay near Naofumi-sama." (Atlas)<br/>
"Firo will… Go for a walk." (Firo)<br/>
"Atlas, let’s get out of here already." (Fohl)<br/>
"No way, Onii-sama." (Atlas)<br/>
"I’ll go patrol the outside." (Sadina)<br/>
Atlas will stay beside me, and Fohl will follow her.<br/>
Firo will inspect the laboratory’s interior, and Sadina will patrol.<br/>
"Then get to it." (Naofumi)<br/>
On my orders, Sadina and Firo depart.<br/>
"Naofumi-sama, what will you be doing next?" (Atlas)<br/>
"Isn’t it obvious? My goal is to revive Raphtalia!" (Naofumi)<br/>
I concentrate my Shield’s power on a stone tablet, and the Castle Plant draws in more and more of the land’s power… Using Raphtalia’s DNA from the hair in my Shield, I began researching ways to recreate her body.<br/>
The probability this hair is from the fake is exceedingly low.<br/>
It’s something I got when Raphtalia was still but a child.<br/>
If only I can recover her soul, it should work out.<br/>
It’s not like I’m omnipotent. Even if I have been granted a complete understanding of Alchemy, there is no precedent to reviving the dead.<br/>
But reviving my lost Raphtalia is something I’m willing to risk my life for.<br/>
For that sake, I begin my experiments.<br/>
I won’t make something half-assed like a homunculus.<br/>
This is a ritual to perfectly resurrect my ideal Raphtalia.<br/>
Inside of the large culture tube in front of me, magic-made electricity races back and forth. The power of the land gathers. My dreams gather.<br/>
And in order to make it go off without a hitch, I take care of all bugs and problems personally.<br/>
"From here on, I will be conducting research. Just watching will be boring, you know." (Naofumi)<br/>
"It’s fine, Naofumi-sama. Just being near you is enough for me." (Atlas)<br/>
"I see." (Naofumi)<br/>
"Atlas! What are you saying!?" (Fohl)<br/>
"Onii-sama, if you have free time right now, won’t you offer assistance to the people who Naofumi-sama just granted power to?" (Atlas)<br/>
"Uu…" (Fohl)<br/>
Atlas and Fohl whisper together, and after a while, Fohl heads off to the slaves I had just treated.<br/>
"Now it’s finally quiet. Please research to your heart’s content." (Atlas)<br/>
"Thanks." (Naofumi)<br/>
I immersed myself in the research.<br/>
Perhaps 6 hours have already passed.<br/>
I finally finished the first stage of my experimentation.<br/>
When I turned around, Atlas waved her hand at me.<br/>
She was watching me the whole time, was she? She has too much free time.<br/>
"Naofumi-chan. How are things going on your side?" (Sadina)<br/>
"Master~ The food is really good." (Firo)<br/>
"Yeah, though the taste has dropped a bit from when Niichan makes it personally." (Kiel)<br/>
Sadina, Firo and Kiel drop by together.<br/>
I installed an auto cooking function into the residential area’s dining hall.<br/>
With the push of a button, it can instantly make pre-set dishes.<br/>
At the moment, the menu is a bit lacking, but at least it’s edible.<br/>
"Oh, you came at a good time." (Naofumi)<br/>
"Niichan, what are you doing? Everyone’s already well rested." (Kiel)<br/>
"I see. Just watch for a second." (Naofumi)<br/>
I flip a switch, and the culmination of my research materializes before us.<br/>
Electricity fills the tube, and smoke rises. The Experiment finishes.<br/>
Firo tilts her head as she focuses her eyes on the dish.<br/>
Eventually the smoke wrapping around it clears, and the bubbles that formed in the liquid within subside. The form of a new Raphtalia shows itself.<br/>
"What is this?" (Firo)<br/>
I look upon my own results.<br/>
"Fumu… I guess this is the best I can do for a prototype."  (Naofumi)<br/>
Inside the tube floats something like a… Raccoon? A Tanuki? A Red panda…? A life form that I can only see as a mix of the three is suspended in the glass.<br/>
<br/>
(TL: Raccoon, Tanuki and Red Panda, images inserted by Translator.)<br/>
With that form, I guess letting it out won’t cause any problems.<br/>
Using the dragon pulse, I can rapidly elevate its level. This skill sucks up the experience lying dormant in the earth, and allows me to grant it unto people. It’s a higher form of an ability wild monsters naturally possess.<br/>
At the moment, the maximum I can grant is up to level 30.<br/>
I drain the liquid out of the tube, and take out the new life form I had created.<br/>
The new life shakes off the excess liquid on its fur, and looks over at me.<br/>
"Rafu~."<br/>
It slightly raises its front leg to greet me.<br/>
"Um… What’s this supposed to be, Niichan?" (Kiel)<br/>
"Is it a monster? Its Chi is somewhat reminiscent of Raphtalia-san. Somewhat." (Atlas)<br/>
"Fumu, It’s a life-form born of my research to revive Raphtalia." (Naofumi)<br/>
"Amazing, Niichan. You created a new type of monster!" (Kiel)<br/>
"Ara, Naofumi-chan is incredible." (Sadina)<br/>
Firo approaches Raphtalia Prototype 1, and starts sniffing it.<br/>
Don’t eat it.<br/>
If you eat it, I’ll modify your form to be the same as it.<br/>
"Yeah, it’s smell is like Onee-chan. Its looks are completely different, but its tail and the feeling that I get are similar." (Firo)<br/>
"Rafu~"<br/>
"Well, my research isn’t over yet. Let’s call this one the first generation of the newly formed Raph race." (Naofumi)<br/>
"Yay. Pleasure working with you, small Onee-chan!" (Firo)<br/>
"Rafu~!"<br/>
"It should have some ability for battle as well. I’ll be continuing this until I can make the Real Raphtalia’s body. The number of Raphs will be multiplying until then." (Naofumi)<br/>
Just in case, I’ve given it the ability to fight. I tampered with quite a bit.<br/>
Gene modification sure comes in handy here.<br/>
Honestly, to take over the world, I’m greatly lacking in manpower, so mass production is a possibility.<br/>
They’re based on a person I trust. The Raph Race may prove to be a great asset.<br/>
"Next, I’ll make a system to mass produce Raphs…" (Naofumi)<br/>
As I was preparing to give a fervent speech, the alarm went off.<br/>
"W-what?" (Naofumi)<br/>
I put my hand on a tablet to see what set it off.<br/>
What’s displayed is the figure of that fake, Ren and Itsuki infiltrating the first Tower Plant.<br/>
"What!?" (Naofumi)<br/>
They got the first one on the first try?<br/>
No, this isn’t the time to be wondering about that.<br/>
That tower’s defense mechanisms won’t be able to hold off against that fake, and those Heroes.<br/>
"Ku…"<br/>
Even if I send Motoyasu and His Filo Rials, it will be too late to stop the First Tower’s destruction.<br/>
With their game knowledge, I can’t deny the possibility Ren and Itsuki figured out the towers.<br/>
I focus the display on the tower’s inside.<br/>
The fakes easily get through the tower and break the controlling device at the summit.<br/>
"Good! Let’s move on to the next one!"<br/>
Fu… How foolish. Don’t think the next one will be so easy.<br/>
I’ve prepared some things just in case something like this happened.<br/>
As soon as the device stopped functioning on the first one, the energy allotted to it flew towards the second tower. The power output on the second one greatly rose.<br/>
The Fake and her heroes gaze absentmindedly at the second tower.<br/>
And they head towards it upon Gaelion. But without accomplishing anything, they quickly return.<br/>
"It seems my Emergency Line is functioning correctly." (Naofumi)<br/>
"emergency Line? Did you do something, Naofumi-chan?" (Sadina)<br/>
"Yeah, when one tower gets destroyed, it will send all of its stored energy to the next one, and strengthen it. The next tower gets a large boost." (Naofumi)<br/>
"Boost?" (Sadina)<br/>
"Yeah, for about 20 hours, that energy will impede anyone trying to proceed to the next one." (Naofumi)<br/>
The barrier was made for the purpose of buying time.<br/>
In that time, I’ll be able to prepare myself.<br/>
But I never thought I would actually be using these emergency measures.<br/>
"I was going to rest for a bit, but it appears that that’s no happening. I won’t let those Fakers destroy the second tower. Motoyasu, use your portal to jump, and bestow retribution onto those that oppose me. Take this with you." (Naofumi)<br/>
It’s a memory crystal that I made with Magic Gem Production.<br/>
I also gave him a video one with my proclamation of war recorded on it.<br/>
With this, I am officially waging war on those mongrels.<br/>
"Understood, Father-in-Law!" (Motoyasu)<br/>
"Should we accompany him?"<br/>
"No, you guys should help supply energy to the second tower. Otherwise we’ll run out." (Naofumi)<br/>
If the slaves leave the flow of magic, then managing the defenses and the system will be difficult.<br/>
The best option is to send Motoyasu to cut down their forces.<br/>
"Sadina, you go too. Motoyasu can’t hear the words of women, so use Midori as a translator." (Naofumi)<br/>
"Got it." (Sadina)<br/>
"Next is… right. Why don’t I present my new Raph race to them?" (Naofumi)<br/>
While waving her hand, Sadina flies off with Motoyasu through his portal.<br/>
Good, now I’ll be able to offer their sought-after retribution.<br/>
The sound from the display picked up.<br/>
"For there to be that sort of gimmick… Naofumi-sama sure likes being troublesome." (Raphtalia)<br/>
"How do we dispel that barrier? We’ll need to destroy all of the towers to proceed, right?" (Ren)<br/>
"I don’t know. But…" (Itsuki)<br/>
The fakes return to the village by portal to face Motoyasu, who returned in much the same way.<br/>
"Motoyasu just naturally returned through his portal.Aren’t we supposed to be seiging them right now?" (Itsuki)<br/>
Hahaha. Fools.<br/>
If you have no reinforcements, why would you initiate a siege?<br/>
Our forces have the option of going on the offensive at any time.<br/>
Eventually, Motoyasu begins carrying out my orders. He opens his mouth.<br/>
"By Father-in-Law’s orders, I have come for battle! Now fall before me for the sake of my promotion! " (Motoyasu)<br/>
"Quit messing around, Motoyasu! You’re choosing the wrong people to side with!" (Ren)<br/>
"I’m not wrong. My enemies are Firo-tan’s, and Father-in-Law’s enemies." (Motoyasu)<br/>
Taking a stance with his spear, Motoyasu begins running towards the fakes.<br/>
"Ku! Like I’d let you!"<br/>
Ren steps in front of Motoyasu, and his sword collides with the spear.<br/>
"Motoyasu, snap out of it. There’s no way Naofumi would think of things like that. We should be resolving this incident as quickly as possible." (Ren)<br/>
"No, Father-in-Law’s words are absolute. Meteor Spear!" (Motoyasu)<br/>
Ren parries the spear that came flying at him.<br/>
The blast makes a large crater as it comes into contact with the ground.<br/>
"Move aside!"<br/>
Raphtalia rushes in front, and consecutivey slashes at Motoyasu.<br/>
"Gufu…"<br/>
It’s most likely a Hengen Musou skill that ignores defense.<br/>
Since Motoyasu can’t handle Chi as well as me, he begins taking damage.<br/>
"What are you doing to my Mokun!?"<br/>
The damage itself isn’t particularily, high, but Kuu, Marin and Midori step up to protect Motoyasu.<br/>
"Motoyasu-chan ran forward too fast. You need to cooperate better, or you won’t even win battles where you have the upper hand." (Sadina)<br/>
Sadina follows up close behind, and holds up her harpoon.<br/>
And from behind her, the new Raph Race specimen flies forward.<br/>
"Rafu~"<br/>
"W-what is… that?"<br/>
The fake, and the heroes. Everyone left in the village points their fingers.<br/>
Hahaha. Tremble before my technology.<br/>
"It’s something Father-in-Law created… A new breed of monster!" (Motoyasu)<br/>
"Rafu~"<br/>
"W-what is it…? It looks kinda cute, but it’s a monster I’ve never seen before." (Ren)<br/>
"I wonder. It’s voice… sounds a little like Raphtalia’s." (Itsuki)<br/>
Itsuki looks at the Raph race specimen, and points at Raphtalia.<br/>
The Raph runs forward, and releases illusion magic.<br/>
One by one, illusionary Raphs manifest, and cover the landscape.<br/>
"Uwah!"<br/>
"""Rafu~!"""<br/>
The illusionary Raphs begin their assault.<br/>
Since they aren’t real, they don’t cause any damage, but the Raph’s target is only a single individual.<br/>
"There!" (Raphtalia)<br/>
Damn! The faker finds the real Raph among the illusions, and slashes at it.<br/>
"Rafu~!"<br/>
It dodges by a paper thinmargin, and does a flip before landing on the ground. It points its paw at the fake.<br/>
And it loudly proclaims.<br/>
"Fake~"<br/>
"What…?"<br/>
