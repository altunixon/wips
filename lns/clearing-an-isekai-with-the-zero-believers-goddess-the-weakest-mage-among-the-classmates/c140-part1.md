[Clearing an Isekai with the Zero-Believers Goddess – The Weakest Mage among the Classmates c140 part1](https://isekailunatic.com/2020/08/25/wm-chapter-140-the-decisive-battle-in-the-demonic-forest-1/)
<br/><br/>
“That stupid daughter of mine!” <br/>
The Chief-san raised his voice in anger.<br/>
All the children of Rosalie-san held their heads, including Lucy.<br/>
Maximilian-san and Flona-san were making complicated expressions.<br/>
And I…<br/>
“Let’s go after her.” (Makoto)<br/>
I proposed this.<br/>
“Wait, Makoto. The 18th spell of Mama is Teleport.” (Lucy)<br/>
“There’s the chance that we might chase after her only for Rosalie-san to return…” (Aya)<br/>
Lucy and Sa-san explained the reason why everyone is here.<br/>
That’s…vexing indeed.<br/>
“Are you saying we have no choice but to wait?” (Makoto)<br/>
“It is hard to think that the Crimson Witch Rosalie-sama would lose anyways…” (Janet)<br/>
Janet-san seems to trust in the strength of Lucy’s mother.<br/>
Well, she was strong enough to easily defeat a Demon Lord Confidant after all.<br/>
“But even Rosalie isn’t invincible. Rosalie said that she can’t win against the White Great Sage-sama.” <br/>
“100 years ago, the one who defeated the Demon Lord Valac was the Sun Country’s Hero…” <br/>
The family of Lucy were worried about Rosalie-san.<br/>
I asked what bothered me.<br/>
“The Great Sage-sama is stronger than Rosalie-san?” (Makoto)<br/>
“Mother herself said that she actually fought with her and lost, so there’s no mistake.” <br/>
Lucy’s sister answered me.<br/>
“Eh?! Mama and the Great Sage-sama?” (Lucy)<br/>
Lucy didn’t know either, huh.<br/>
“When Mother-sama married in the Sun Country, she said it was suffocating with its hierarchical system, so she challenged the Great Sage-sama of that time to a match.” <br/>
“The result was 20 matches, 20 defeats. She apparently got beaten to a pulp without being able to put a finger on her.” <br/>
The sisters of Lucy tell me.<br/>
Wow, Great Sage-sama.<br/>
Oops, we derailed there.<br/>
“And so, has the next move been decided?” (Makoto)<br/>
I ask everyone and the silence returns.<br/>
Flona-san told me in representation of everyone that:<br/>
-Today at noon, the Wood Country’s forces are going to be gathering while marching to the Demon Lord’s grave. <br/>
-The safe choice would be to match that.<br/>
-But are we going to leave Rosalie-san for so long?<br/>
That’s what they are troubled about.<br/>
I glanced at my comrades.<br/>
Lucy was hanging her head down and pondering.<br/>
Even though she has finally met her mother after several years. <br/>
Of course she would be worried about the safety of her family.<br/>
“Then, how about we go to the Demonic Forest first?” (Makoto)<br/>
“Makoto?” (Lucy)<br/>
“You are worried about your mother, right?” (Makoto)<br/>
“Y-Yeah…” (Lucy)<br/>
Lucy puts her hands together seemingly uneasy.<br/>
“Well then, we are going to go ahead to the Demonic Forest, so…” (Makoto)<br/>
“W-Wait, please! I can’t let you go on your own, Makoto-niisan!” (Leo)<br/>
Prince Leonard hurriedly stopped me.<br/>
“It is okay. Sa-san and I can use Stealth, so we will be advancing while avoiding the monsters. If we find Rosalie-san, we will have her use Teleport.” (Makoto)<br/>
I also tell them that if we can’t find her, we will be hiding till we reunite with everyone.<br/>
“Are you okay with that, Lucy, Sa-san?” (Makoto)<br/>
“Okay\~.”, Sa-san’s response was light.<br/>
That really helps me relax.<br/>
“…Thanks, Makoto.” (Lucy)<br/>
Lucy directs a grateful look at me.<br/>
“Eh? What about me?” (Furiae)<br/>
Furiae-san points at herself flustered.<br/>
“You stay here, Princess. Stay together with Flona-san and the others.” (Makoto)<br/>
If she is together with the Wood Oracle, I can be at ease.<br/>
“…Leaving me behind again?” (Furiae)<br/>
She says with eyes half-closed.<br/>
“No, we can’t bring you to the Demon Lord’s grave…” (Makoto)<br/>
It is dangerous.<br/>
But it seems like Furiae-san was not convinced.<br/>
“I can be of use, you know? I am good at necromancy, so my affinity with the monsters in the Demonic Forest is good.” (Furiae)<br/>
She pokes my cheek. <br/>
By the time I noticed, Tsui was kicking my legs.<br/>
You’re telling me to bring you too?<br/>
(…Hmm.) (Makoto)<br/>
As her Guardian Knight, I don’t want to bring her to a dangerous place. <br/>
“Yeah, no. You are staying, Princess.” (Makoto)<br/>
“Eeeh?!” “Nyaa Nyaa!” <br/>
Furaiae-san and Tsui protested.<br/>
Hey, you black cat, you could cry normally, huh.<br/>
You guys will be waiting here.<br/>
“Okay then, we will use 5 minutes to prepare and then depa—” (Makoto)<br/>
“Wait, Rozes Hero-dono.” (Wolt)<br/>
The one who called me to a stop was the Chief-san.<br/>
He looks straight into my eyes.<br/>
“I was worried about something silly. Rosalie is our family. We shall go together!” (Wolt)<br/>
“I will guide the way, Rozes Hero-sama. There’s shortcuts that only elves know.” <br/>
“Let’s prepare at once.” <br/>
“Onee-chan, Onii-chan!” (Lucy)<br/>
In the end, more than half of the fighters of the Kanan Village will be chasing after Rosalie-san.<br/>
The remaining half will be protecting the village.<br/>
The ones going will be mostly the male elf warriors (mainly the brothers of Lucy).<br/>
Also the Wind Tree Hero, Maximilian-san.<br/>
In the end, Prince Leonard and Janet-san will be coming too.<br/>
The Chief-san has to keep in contact with the other villages, so he is staying.<br/>
(He rampaged saying ‘I will be going too!’, but his family persuaded him.) (Makoto)<br/>
Furiae-san will be staying here with Flona-san.<br/>
Most of the female elves will be staying in the village.<br/>
Almost all the elves are high rank mages, so the women are powerful fighters too.<br/>
Unless it is quite the extreme situation, the defense of the village should be fine.<br/>
We departed to the Demonic Forest.<br/>
◇◇<br/>
We silently advance through the Demonic Forest.<br/>
It isn’t the same path Sa-san and I explored before.<br/>
It is apparently a shortcut to the Demon Lord’s grave that only the people of the village know about.<br/>
There’s few monsters and we can safely advance…apparently.<br/>
The mist is dense in the Demonic Forest even at noon.<br/>
The branches of the giant magic trees that are said to surpass the 1,000 years in age were overlapping and blocking the sunlight.<br/>
The Water Spirits were noisy.<br/>
“…There’s a lot of monsters.” (Janet)<br/>
Janet-san mutters.<br/>
She can use Detection that has a wide effective range.<br/>
What she says can be trusted.<br/>
“What do you think, Lucy?” (Makoto)<br/>
“Yeah…this might be the first time I hear such a noisy Demonic Forest.” (Lucy)<br/>
I could see the elves guiding the way were also tense.<br/>
We advance through the Demonic Forest carefully.<br/>
After a while, all of a sudden…<br/>
*Bzt!*<br/>
A head-splitting headache attacked me.<br/>
(What’s this…?) (Makoto)<br/>
A headache from Detection…?<br/>
The elf warriors guiding the front stopped.<br/>
(…That’s not it.) (Makoto)<br/>
The elves at the front turned into stone! <br/>
The moment my brain registered that…<br/>
“Water Magic: [Mist]!” (Makoto)<br/>
I put my all to create a heavy fog.<br/>
The vision is blocked in an instant.<br/>
I can’t see anything in a distance of 1 meter.<br/>
“Hoh! Splendid! With just one use of the Petrification Gaze, you took the optimal option of blocking the vision. I would like to see the face of that mage!” <br/>
A voice that seemed to be enjoying this from the bottom of his heart.<br/>
There’s not even the need to ask who it is.<br/>
I remember it.<br/>
“Excuse the lateness. My name is the Setekh of the Magic Eyes. The one who dirties the lowest seats of the Great Ruler-sama. I have been waiting for you people, the warriors of the Wood Country!” (Setekh)<br/>
He is really excited…<br/>
Setekh of the Petrification Eyes, huh.<br/>
Looks like his legendary magic eyes have returned.<br/>
This is troubling…<br/>
“Everyone! Please come out!” (Setekh)<br/>
Setekh shouts loudly. <br/>
“Raaaaaaah!”<br/>
“Raaaaaaah!”<br/>
“Raaaaaaah!”<br/>
The voices of many beasts rang.<br/>
“We are surrounded!” (Lucy)<br/>
Lucy shouts.<br/>
I also noticed slightly later that we are in the very middle of enemy territory.<br/>
They were waiting in ambush?<br/>
“Everyone, scatter! You will be targeted if you are too grouped up!” (Max)<br/>
Maximilian-san shouts.<br/>
“Sa-san, I count on you with Prince Leonard!” (Makoto)<br/>
“Got it!” (Aya)<br/>
Sa-san can use Stealth, so she should be able to carry Prince Leonard alone!<br/>
“Lucy, let’s go!” (Makoto)<br/>
I pull the hand of Lucy and activate Stealth.<br/>
“W-Wa—!” <br/>
“Ssh! Keep quiet.” (Makoto)<br/>
I covered the mouth of Lucy and, silently, but quickly left our location.<br/>
We are surrounded by enemies. <br/>
But it is not a perfect encirclement.<br/>
We can run away if it is now.<br/>
“Fufufu, I am here, Wood Country’s Hero-dono. How about slaying me and raising your name?” (Setekh)<br/>
 I could hear the provocation of Setekh.<br/>
Why does he know the Wood Country’s Hero is here?<br/>
Can he tell just from his voice?<br/>
I use [Eavesdrop].<br/>
But I don’t hear the sounds of battle.<br/>
Everyone should be retreating from this place.<br/>
We have to escape too.<br/>
“That’s boring… Even though His Majesty Bifrons will soon be reviving…Shuri isn’t coming back.” (Setekh)<br/>
I faintly pick up those words of his with Eavesdrop.<br/>
(Soon…? He means at the full moon tonight, right?) (Makoto)<br/>
Is that really the case?<br/>
I had a slight bad feeling about that, but I decided to prioritize running away.<br/>
◇◇<br/>
Within the deep mist.<br/>
We held our breaths as I continued using Stealth.<br/>
I eventually stopped hearing the voices and footsteps of the beasts.<br/>
I could also confirm with my Detection Skill that the enemies were getting further away.<br/>
Managed to escape huh…<br/>
I sighed in relief.<br/>
I turn around and speak to my comrade.<br/>
“Lucy, we managed to escape…e-eh?” (Makoto)<br/>
“…Sorry. I was told not to speak, so…” <br/>
The one who was being pulled by my hand and had an apologetic expression…was a female knight with blonde hair and sharp eyes.<br/>
Janet Valentine-san.<br/>
