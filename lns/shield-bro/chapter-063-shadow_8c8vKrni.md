Degojaru~ <br/>
 <br/>
Chapter 63 <br/>
 <br/>
Shadow <br/>
 <br/>
We are travelling south along the border, searching for any gaps within the border patrol. <br/>
Motoyasu is extremely annoying. He's been chasing us ever since. <br/>
There hasn't been any situations where we were truly in danger, since that one back at the border thanks to Firo's swift running. <br/>
 <br/>
the strange thing is that there has been no sign of either Ren or Itsuki. <br/>
Did they give up? Or are they laying an ambush somewhere? <br/>
In the first place trying to accuse me of brainwashing was irrational. <br/>
Did they lose interest in this event and go back to levelling? <br/>
I would understand if Ren gave up since he was already sceptical, but was it good luck for us that Itsuki is also nowhere to be found? <br/>
On the contrary, Motoyasu is way too persistent. <br/>
 <br/>
Either way, it is fortunate since his attacks aren't as strong as Ren's and he doesn't have any ranged attacks like Itsuki. <br/>
To be honest Motoyasu seems more interested in Firo than actually bringing the second princess back. <br/>
Still problems are piling up non stop...... <br/>
 <br/>
"What should we do?......" <br/>
 <br/>
It is irresponsible to just pass everyday being disgruntled, I must consider what we should do. <br/>
Border patrol is too strict. Isn't there somewhere we can sneak over? <br/>
Living as a fugitive everyday won't solve anything, and my life is over when the next wave arrives. <br/>
 <br/>
In this case, recklessly crossing the border may not actually be a bad idea. <br/>
As it stands our names will never be cleared. Those chasing me may also avoid Silt Welt. <br/>
 <br/>
That night we discussed our course of action over the camp fire. <br/>
Since Firo is stupid, she is not listening. <br/>
The second princess and Raphtalia had some reaction, but that was to be expected. <br/>
 <br/>
"It might be a little tough, but if we want to break through, then here is our best bet." <br/>
 <br/>
It would be hard to pull off. But, as long as the other heroes don't interfere my defence should be able to break though. <br/>
 <br/>
"You're right, we won't last if we continue escaping like this......" <br/>
"Yeah......" <br/>
"Mel-chan!" <br/>
 <br/>
Firo returns to her human form and starts playing with the second princess. <br/>
Kan! <br/>
Hm? I heard a strange sound coming from the scruff of my neck. <br/>
What? It's not painful but...... <br/>
I immediately turn around, and see a needle fall down. <br/>
 <br/>
"Master, enemies!" <br/>
"What?" <br/>
 <br/>
Was that a blow dart just now? <br/>
Or was it something Itsuki fired? <br/>
I cannot confirm anything due visibility since it's night time. <br/>
 <br/>
"I didn't notice until he attacked." <br/>
"What?" <br/>
 <br/>
Bofun!a bunch of darts fly out of nowhere and Firo expands her wings to cover the second princess. <br/>
Can Itsuki even fire so many at once? <br/>
No, Leaving that aside! <br/>
The main usage of blow darts are to apply poisons. Firo and I will be fine due to our poison resistance, but it will be dangerous if Raphtalia or the second princess gets hit. <br/>
I have no idea what kind of poison they are using either. <br/>
If I know what poison they are using I can make an antidote. <br/>
There were a bunch of antidotes in the wagon and carriage too...... <br/>
But I can't treat anyone in these conditions! <br/>
 <br/>
"Ah......" <br/>
 <br/>
I turn my gaze to Raphtalia. At that moment a blowgun dart aimed at her appears. <br/>
 <br/>
"Air St- <br/>
 <br/>
I shout for Air Strike Shield in haste, but I don't know if I can make it. <br/>
Immediately, a high-pitched screech is heard and the dart was stopped. <br/>
 <br/>
"That was dangerous degojaru." <br/>
 <br/>
Suddenly, someone in jet-black clothes appears and defends Raphtalia. <br/>
His face is covered by cloth so I can't see it. <br/>
I can't tell if his voice is male or female. Who is that? A ninja? <br/>
Degojaru? <br/>
 <br/>
"Hurry up and flee degojaru! <br/>
 <br/>
In the shadows of the trees and bushes fighting could be heard. <br/>
 <br/>
"Hero of the Shield-dono, leave this to us and run away degojaru. Wait for me after you have escaped, I want to talk with you degojaru." <br/>
"What is going on!" <br/>
"There is no time to explain right now, I'll do it later degojaru!" <br/>
"Tch! Firo, Raphtalia, Second princess!" <br/>
"Okay~" <br/>
"Yeah" <br/>
"U-understood!" <br/>
 <br/>
While riding on Firo, blow darts were flying around us. <br/>
 <br/>
"Do you know who that person was?" <br/>
"I think so, that is probably my mother's secret guard corps......" <br/>
 <br/>
Explains the second princess while we were getting away. <br/>
 <br/>
"Really?" <br/>
"Yeah. I know the person who helped Raphtalia-san. She is my mother's body double." <br/>
"Now that I think, about it her way of speaking is familiar." <br/>
 <br/>
Is she that woman I passed in the hallway after parting with trash? <br/>
Her behaviour and appearance left a strong impression. <br/>
 <br/>
"So what exactly is going on?  We got ambushed, but we have no idea who did it." <br/>
 <br/>
I would say it was Itsuki, but that guy should not be capable of such things. <br/>
Judging by his character, he would confront me head on. <br/>
 <br/>
"Assassination corps of the country......maybe" <br/>
"There's an assassination corps?" <br/>
 <br/>
Now that's dangerous. Well, places where the nobles and kings completely trust each other do not exist. <br/>
That leads to a great deal of problems being handled behind closed doors. <br/>
It's quite simple actually. <br/>
 <br/>
"Though in reality they are the same as the secret guard corps......" <br/>
"You guys have separate assassination corps?" <br/>
"......I don't know" <br/>
"I see......" <br/>
 <br/>
I guess there's no choice but to hear from someone who knows. <br/>
After running a certain distance on Firo, we prepared and waited in case of more enemies. <br/>
 <br/>
"Hmm?" <br/>
 <br/>
Firo reacts immediately. <br/>
 <br/>
"Here it comes." <br/>
 <br/>
Suddenly, the ninja-like person appears in front of me. <br/>
 <br/>
"Sorry for the wait degojaruna" <br/>
"Ah don't worry about it. Thanks to you we got away safely." <br/>
"First of all, I should introduce myself degojaruga...... Have you already heard from princess Melty degojaruka?" <br/>
"I heard you are a body double. And you are either from the secret guard crops or some assassination unit." <br/>
"That is not entirely correct degojaru. We are the special duty corps of the country, and our aliases is [Shadow] degojaru." <br/>
"I see." <br/>
"By the way, I do not have a name degojaru. I believe shadow shall suffice degojaru." <br/>
 <br/>
Shadow huh...... Trying to sound cool? <br/>
I wonder if it's just the difference between my world and the inhabitants of this world. <br/>
Since there are ninjas I'm reminded of the Showa era. <br/>
 <br/>
"So, who did you fight?" <br/>
"Shadows of the country and church degojaru." <br/>
"Aren't you from the same organization?" <br/>
"The organization is not unified degojaruyo. There are factions within the organization that are fighting each other degojaru." <br/>
 <br/>
There are so many things wrong with that but I'll refrain from commenting for now..... <br/>
 <br/>
"Why did you help us?" <br/>
 <br/>
Since that's what I'm most curious about I'll ask. <br/>
I have a few guesses, but none are concrete.	 <br/>
 <br/>
"I cannot answer that degojaru." <br/>
"I see. Are you sworn to secrecy?" <br/>
"All I will say is that this one works as princess Melty's guard degojaru." <br/>
"I don't believe that." <br/>
 <br/>
She didn't even show up when the second princess as being attacked. <br/>
 <br/>
"I did not appear because I knew the Hero of the shield-dono could protect her degojaru." <br/>
"You bastard......" <br/>
 <br/>
That means she knew but stayed silent. <br/>
Although,she seems fairly competent. <br/>
 <br/>
"Originally I was somewhere else with her majesty the queen but I was ordered to watch over Hero of the Shield-dono degojaru." <br/>
 <br/>
The self-named shadow shows a map and points. <br/>
What she was pointing at was the neighbouring country to our south west. <br/>
The opposite direction of Silt Welt. <br/>
 <br/>
"Right now her Majesty the Queen is there degojaru. Since this country is in the opposite direction of Silt Welt where Hero of the Shield-dono is escaping to, patrols are scarce degojaru." <br/>
"Oh....." <br/>
 <br/>
For some reason, I feel that if I run away to the country to Demi-humans I would receive some recognition. <br/>
It occurred to me that there may be something in the country of Demi-humans that believes in the shield, similar to how this country believes in the Three Heroes Church. <br/>
I can probably safely go into exile there in cases like this, and it would be very bad for trash. <br/>
Though since they are putting so many resources to guard the border that it makes it impossible to break through. <br/>
This distance can be covered by Firo in two and a half weeks, but it will be hard to advance since the other heroes are anticipating it. <br/>
Even though we have to take a detour I want to go. <br/>
 <br/>
"This latest case has many things behind it degojaru. I will cooperate with Hero of the shield-dono as much as possible degojaru." <br/>
"What do you mean?" <br/>
"Right now the higher ups of the Three Heroes Church are discussing about the activities of hero of the shield-dono degojaru. So I had no choice but to move and inform you degojaruyo." <br/>
"Hmm.....So in other words, they had a reason to maintain that farce of claiming I have the power to brainwash." <br/>
 <br/>
My activities recently consisted mostly of selling medicine and helping people who were in trouble. <br/>
However, as a result of those actions I solved problems that the other heroes have caused. <br/>
It seems that due to these events, people are starting to question the legend of the Hero of the shield spread by the church. <br/>
If they can prove that I am capable of large-scale brainwashing, then the people's faith in the Church would be restored. <br/>
But won't it also mean that if I can prove my innocence the Three Heroes Church will receive a devastating blow? <br/>
 <br/>
"What should we do degojaru? If you are planning on going to Silt Welt, would you require help degojaruka? <br/>
"That's......" <br/>
 <br/>
Giving someone else a difficult job and relaxing myself is not one of my hobbies. <br/>
Even if I do just escape, when the wave comes I'll be summoned into the midst of enemies. <br/>
That's very inconvenient. <br/>
The church, The bitch, and the trash king will all want to capture and torture me. <br/>
Rather than going into exile recklessly, and then getting summoned into a trap, this might be more effective. <br/>
If this goes well my remaining days here will be easy. <br/>
But...... <br/>
 <br/>
"What would the queen gain from helping me. The Three Heroes Church may get destroyed." <br/>
"I cannot answer that degojaru." <br/>
 <br/>
Shadow is only giving me answers about the queen, but not what I should do next. <br/>
Though she is certainly the queen's subordinate. <br/>
The second princess is someone we both need to protect, and since she is a subordinate of the queen, I cannot do anything that might disadvantage her. <br/>
As far as I am concerned meeting the queen would be more beneficial for me. <br/>
 <br/>
Frankly, I cannot see what the queen's goal is. <br/>
From what I can make out of the second princess's speech and behaviour, her goal would be to prevent wars between this country and another. <br/>
Furthermore, she understands what is happening to me, due to the deep-rooted and crazy legends in this country about the devil of the shield. <br/>
The shadow also said "I want to cooperate". <br/>
It seems the queen does not share the same views as the Three Heroes Church. <br/>
That is just a safe line though...... <br/>
 <br/>
Hmm...... Perhaps she isn't my enemy. <br/>
Though it is also doubtful whether or not she can be called a friend, it is still better than my current hand and the present conditions. <br/>
 <br/>
"You saved Raphtalia, so I'll hear you out. Do I only have to meet the queen?" <br/>
 <br/>
This is nothing but a farce, and I don't really have any choice but to willingly participate. <br/>
 <br/>
"I don't like the idea of acting based on someone else's ideas, but it seems to be for the best. But if you deceive me......" <br/>
"I know degojaru. Then I'll leave at once degojaru. We don't know when the shadows on the church's side may show up degojarukara" <br/>
 <br/>
After saying so she disappeared instantly. <br/>
Though my last words were a joke, it seems to have been taken seriously. <br/>
 <br/>
"Can we trust her?" <br/>
 <br/>
Honestly, I am slightly suspicious. <br/>
 <br/>
"It's alright...... because mother trusts her." <br/>
"I can't understand your mother......" <br/>
 <br/>
Though at least her thinking seems to be different from both trash and bitch. <br/>
So far all I have is that she seems to be friendly, but that is only based on information from shadow and the second princess, her true purpose still remains unknown. <br/>
I also cannot deny that this could all be another a plot to assassinate the second princess by the Three Heroes Church. <br/>
I have no other choices so if this is a conspiracy by the queen to kill me, I am doomed. <br/>
In the end, we advance in the opposite direction of Silt Welt. <br/>
I do not want to believe it, but there is also a chance that the second princess was truly abandoned. <br/>
 <br/>
But, it is necessary to know the queen's agenda. <br/>
I cannot just view this situation as black and white any more. <br/>
 <br/>
"Anyway, I have decided on our destination." <br/>
"Okay. Let's go." <br/>
"All right.Let's go. Firo-chan" <br/>
"Firo will do her best!" <br/>
 <br/>
We have taken a step from escaping abroad aimlessly. <br/>
Now we will set a course towards the south west.
