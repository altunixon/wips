<br/>
-Fuji-yan POV-<br/>
Children bawling.<br/>
Parents soothing them.<br/>
Elderly trembling in uneasiness.<br/>
Everyone is being guided by the Water Country Knights to the evacuation area while being encouraged by them.<br/>
"It has turned into quite the problem, hasn’t it?" (Chris)<br/>
The complexion of Chris-dono isn’t good.<br/>
"Are Takatsuki-sama and the others okay? I would like to participate in the subjugations if possible…" (Nina)<br/>
"This is the Water Country’s capital, so there should be a lot of capable knights and mages… Let’s believe in them." (Fujiwara)<br/>
Even though I have an isekai cheat, I am powerless in these kinds of situations.<br/>
I curse my lack of combat power.<br/>
"Nina, you will be a part of the Makkaren household. I won’t allow you to mix with the adventurers and go to dangerous places." (Chris)<br/>
"But putting Takatsuki-sama, Sasaki-sama, and Lucy-sama in danger, while I alone am in a safe place is just…" (Nina)<br/>
Chris-dono is worrying for Nina-dono, and Nina-dono who is worried about Takki-dono and the others.<br/>
The fact that I understand the both of them makes it more painful.<br/>
The evacuation area is filled with uneasiness, sadness, and…Hm?<br/>
"Nina-dono, Chris-dono, there’s something I want to talk to you about." (Fujiwara)<br/>
I stop the conversation of the two that has divided opinions.<br/>
Within the people that are in fear by the sudden appearance of monsters…there’s one who is trembling in happiness.<br/>
…Could that man possibly be…<br/>
"Nina-dono, that man over there that is wearing a hat deeply, can you capture him alive?" (Fujiwara)<br/>
"Eh?" "Danna-sama? What are you saying?!" <br/>
They of course were surprised.<br/>
"I will take full responsibility. We cannot allow him to escape." (Fujiwara)<br/>
"…There must be a reason why, right? Understood." (Nina)<br/>
"Fujiwara-sama, please explain it later, okay?" (Chris)<br/>
I’m sorry.<br/>
…I have to tell the two of them about the Galge Player Skill one day.<br/>
"I will pull him into a secluded place. I count on you for the rest, Nina-dono." (Fujiwara)<br/>
"Yes, leave it to me." (Nina)<br/>
"Fujiwara-sama, Nina, be careful." (Chris)<br/>
Takki-dono is putting his life on the line in an even more dangerous place.<br/>
I will do what I can, too.<br/>
-Princess Sofia POV-<br/>
I returned to the castle, and left the treatment of Leo to the medical team, and ordered the knights to help in rescuing the citizens.<br/>
"Uhm, Princess-sama, won’t you rest for a bit…?" <br/>
"No need. I will head to the Temple that is serving as a shelter, and check the state of the people. Mother and father are safe, right?" (Sofia)<br/>
"Yes! His Majesty and the Queen have taken refuge in a safe place." <br/>
"Good. I will go change." (Sofia)<br/>
"I will help." <br/>
"No need. Wait there." (Sofia)<br/>
After ordering this to my escort, I closed the door to my room.<br/>
"…Fuuuh." (Sofia)<br/>
I take a breath, and deactivate [Cold Heart].<br/>
The Cold Heart Skill helps me keep my mind composed at all times.<br/>
Its detrimental point is that it makes my expression look cold.<br/>
"~~!" <br/>
My emotions that were calm until now welled up all at once.<br/>
I put both of my hands on my face.<br/>
Hot.<br/>
I walk to the front of the mirror, and look at my face.<br/>
"How can this be…" (Sofia)<br/>
A beet red face was reflected there.<br/>
Is this the face of the Ice Sculpture Princess? <br/>
"Takatsuki Makoto…" (Sofia)<br/>
Just calling that name made my body tremble.<br/>
I hold my body with both of my hands.<br/>
It is not cold, it is the contrary.<br/>
"That…synchronization thing…" (Sofia)<br/>
Holding the hand of a princess without any reserve, and entering me.<br/>
My body and my heart.<br/>
"…"<br/>
I remembered.<br/>
It was as if my back was being penetrated…that sensation.<br/>
It was as if I was being embraced by that man…<br/>
"How vulgar!" (Sofia)<br/>
Me, the Oracle that serves the Goddess Eir-sama!<br/>
Even though this body that has been offered to the Gods has not been dirtied in any capacity! <br/>
The smiling face of Takatsuki Makoto that surfaces in my mind is not going away.<br/>
Leo had been cornered.<br/>
The knights and adventurers were in fear. <br/>
I thought we were already done for.<br/>
The capital of Horun…would be trampled down by a single Giant.<br/>
I was in despair.<br/>
—I will finish it with the next one. I am going full power.<br/>
In that despairing situation, he spoke with a cool tone as if he were having a casual talk.<br/>
—It is thanks to Princess Sofia.<br/>
That face when he smiled at me…<br/>
"This is not the time for that, Sofia!" (Sofia)<br/>
I once again activate the Skill [Cold Heart] and return to my previous expression.<br/>
I quickly change and exit the room.<br/>
I look at my uneasy subordinates.<br/>
"We are heading to the city. The ones who can move, come together with us. But make sure not to push the injured." (Sofia)<br/>
"""Yes!"""<br/>
Let’s forget it for now.<br/>
Right now…I am the symbol of peace for the Water Country.<br/>
I must keep a calm and cold mind.<br/>
◇◇<br/>
-Takatsuki Makoto POV-<br/>
Looks like all the monsters in the city have been defeated. We didn’t encounter any monsters on our way back.<br/>
We returned to the inn, and had Sa-san and Lucy rest in our room at the inn.<br/>
I headed to the Adventurer Guild, and reported about the clown guy and the mysterious voice.<br/>
"The Princess has ordered the investigation of the people involved with the circus troupe. Thank you for the information." <br/>
"…About that mysterious voice…I can’t really say anything about that…" <br/>
The staff member of the guild listened seriously to the talk about the clown.<br/>
But the talk about the mysterious voice, it seemed like they didn’t know what to do with that.<br/>
Well, there’s the chance that I was just hearing things after all.<br/>
After that, I walked around the city, but seeing the knights guiding the citizens, there didn’t seem to be any work as an adventurer, so I returned to the inn.<br/>
As for Fuji-yan, it seems like he had something important to deal with, was the message that Nina-san left to me.<br/>
That he would be busy for a few days, so to wait in the inn.<br/>
I gave him my okay, and decided to rest on that day.<br/>
◇◇<br/>
That night, I went to sleep…<br/>
And was standing in the space of the Goddess.<br/>
"Noah-sama?" (Makoto)<br/>
I looked around, and Noah-sama appeared with a gleeful smile.<br/>
"Hello, Makoto. Good work today." (Noah)<br/>
"Noah-sama, you helped me out greatly today in the fight with the Giant." (Makoto)<br/>
I lower to my knees and give my thanks.<br/>
That hint helped out a lot.<br/>
Without that, we wouldn’t have been able to defeat the Giant.<br/>
"Well, I think you would have been able to find a solution on your own though, Makoto. In that scenario, Aya-chan would have probably died at least once, I think." (Noah)<br/>
"……" <br/>
Shivers run down my spine.<br/>
Thinking about it again, the fight of today was like walking on a tightrope.<br/>
We were saved by the fact that there was a powerful water magic skill holder.<br/>
"Not really. The Water Country has a lot of water related skills, and Leonard-kun has the Supreme Water Magic, so you could have synchronized with him." (Noah)<br/>
"Yeah, there was that hand too." (Makoto)<br/>
But the Prince was fighting the Giant.<br/>
It was impossible to use synchronization in that situation.<br/>
"By the way, that child-like voice that sounded before the Taboo Giant appeared, what was that?" (Makoto)<br/>
Noah-sama might know about it.<br/>
"Aah, that? That was the voice of the person you call the Great Demon Lord." (Noah)<br/>
"Eh?" (Makoto)<br/>
Noah-sama nonchalantly speaks out a shocking statement.<br/>
"The Great Demon Lord has revived?!" (Makoto)<br/>
"No, they don’t. That voice was just a residual will. A past log." (Noah)<br/>
"…Okay?" (Makoto)<br/>
I don’t understand well.<br/>
It looked like it was doing conversation though.<br/>
"You don’t need to worry about it. Anyways, the revival of the Great Demon Lord will be happening. In 1 year more, I think." (Noah)<br/>
"…You are cascading important information as if nothing." (Makoto)<br/>
My head can’t keep up.<br/>
"Well, you don’t need to worry about that, Makoto. I will give you the information you need, when you need it." (Noah)<br/>
"I feel like everything is on the palm of your hand, Noah-sama." (Makoto)<br/>
Is this okay?<br/>
Well, I am the Apostle of Noah-sama, so it should be okay.<br/>
"We godkin cannot interfere directly with the mortals. That’s why we use Apostles, Oracles, and a variety of other things. It is not only me." (Noah)<br/>
‘See?’, Noah-sama says in a cute manner.<br/>
What she is saying isn’t that cute though.<br/>
In Noah-sama’s case, it would be as if I am the only pawn in her chess board.<br/>
Sounds pretty impossible of a game.<br/>
"Wouldn’t you be at least worth being a knight though?" (Noah)<br/>
"Please deny the part about being impossible." (Makoto)<br/>
Well, being told I am not a pawn but a knight made me a bit happy. There must be something wrong with me.<br/>
"You call yourself a chess piece, Makoto, but in reality, you don’t listen to me at all though." (Noah)<br/>
"Really?" (Makoto)<br/>
But Noah-sama, you immediately say things like ‘abandon your comrades’. There’s no way I can do that.<br/>
"…You know, normally, the Apostles of Gods would listen to their Gods more. When I tell you to run away, it is because I put your life above all else after all." (Noah)<br/>
"Well, please give instructions where my comrades can be saved as well." (Makoto)<br/>
"Why are you even telling your God how to give out instructions…?" (Noah)<br/>
Noah-sama made a face of amazement.<br/>
Did I say something weird? I am, huh.<br/>
"Now then, leaving that aside, you did really well today!" (Noah)<br/>
"Really? I feel like there were a lot of things I have to reflect on though." (Makoto)<br/>
A situation where I couldn’t use Spirit Magic and my teammates Lucy and Sa-san couldn’t fight.<br/>
Moreover, we couldn’t just run.<br/>
I was naive in my predictions.<br/>
I have to rethink my strategies.<br/>
"Not that." (Noah)<br/>
"?"<br/>
"The one about getting along better with the Oracle." (Noah)<br/>
"…We don’t get along though?" (Makoto)<br/>
I do think that I get along better with Prince Leonard. But his sister, I wonder.<br/>
After defeating the Taboo Giant, she immediately went somewhere else.<br/>
I know that she must take command as the Princess though.<br/>
"Haaah…" (Noah)<br/>
Noah-sama made a gesture as if saying ‘good grief’.<br/>
"What’s the matter?" (Makoto)<br/>
"This is why dense guys are just…" (Noah)<br/>
"Did you say something?" (Makoto)<br/>
"This is why I don’t like dense guys." (Noah)<br/>
"…"<br/>
She said it twice.<br/>
Must have been important.<br/>
I am not a dense guy…right?<br/>
I am consulting Fuji-yan in regards to Lucy and Sa-san after all.<br/>
"I will be doing my best in getting along with Princess Sofia. Also, I will be training even more and get stronger, okay?" (Makoto)<br/>
So that I can deal with situations like the one of before.<br/>
"How diligent. Then, this super kind Goddess-sama will give you a most useful hint." (Noah)<br/>
Noah-sama patted my head with a big smile.<br/>
She seems to be in a good mood.<br/>
"Makoto, you are using [Clear Mind] when using Spirit Magic, right?" (Noah)<br/>
"Yeah, I am. Not only when using magic, but always though." (Makoto)<br/>
"When using Spirit Magic, try restraining the use of your [Clear Mind]." (Noah)<br/>
"Why?" (Makoto)<br/>
A mind stabilizing Skill like Clear Mind is helpful in the use of magic.<br/>
This is something I was taught in the Water Temple.<br/>
I have felt the use of it in actual combat too.<br/>
"Spirits are happier when you lay bare your emotions." (Noah)<br/>
"…Really?" (Makoto)<br/>
That wasn’t in the books.<br/>
"Anyone would have more fun speaking with an amiable person rather than someone who isn’t, right?" (Noah)<br/>
"…"<br/>
That hurts someone like me with communication problems.<br/>
I see. So the Spirit-sans thought I was an unfriendly person, huh.<br/>
"Well, just try it. You are still a beginner when it comes to Spirit Magic, Makoto." (Noah)<br/>
"Got it. I will try out a variety of things." (Makoto)<br/>
"Yup yup, do your best." (Noah)<br/>
She pets my head. <br/>
I have gotten used to it lately.<br/>
Noah-sama puffed her cheeks.<br/>
Oops, she read my mind.<br/>
"Now then, it is about time." (Makoto)<br/>
Let’s give my thanks and leave.<br/>
"Makoto." (Noah)<br/>
"Yes, what is it?" (Makoto)<br/>
—She suddenly kissed my cheek without prior notice.<br/>
"Today’s reward." (Noah)<br/>
Noah-sama waved her hand with a bright smile.<br/>
"……"<br/>
I forgot to breath.<br/>
That was a complete surprise attack.<br/>
Even when I had Clear Mind on, my heart was banging hard.<br/>
This is bad, from all the seductions until now, that was the one that shook my heart the most.<br/>
…Let’s just accept it as my reward for working hard.<br/>
