<br/>
Note, if you didn’t already know, ESP stands for Extra Sensory Perception, and PSI is greek letter Ψ, and is used to represent psychic phenomena. It doesn’t stand for anything, it’s just the first letter in the word for psychic.<br/>
Chapter 261: ESPer<br/>
"Abilities we’ve had since before we came to this world?"<br/>
Hmm?<br/>
What is Itsuki talking about?<br/>
Is it that?<br/>
Something like how Ren’s world had VRMMOs?<br/>
At that time, Ren called normal MMOs archaic, and threw us into confusion.<br/>
I feel something similar from Itsuki right now.<br/>
"Hey Ren, do you have any idea what Itsuki is talking about right now?" (Naofumi)<br/>
"Sorry. There are a few possibilities, but I’m not sure." (Ren)<br/>
"Fumu." (Naofumi)<br/>
Like Ren, I have my guesses, but for now Itsuki cannot lie, so it would be faster just to ask him.<br/>
The current Itsuki just says whatever pops into his head.<br/>
If we ask him about these powers, he’ll probably answers.<br/>
"Itsuki, what powers would you be talking about? Do you mean about the power of the legendary weapons?" (Naofumi)<br/>
"No. The legendary weapons may have a similar function as well, but I’m referring to something completely different. Isn’t it obvious?" (Itsuki)<br/>
"Hah… Please elaborate. In the world that you came from… what were these powers?" (Naofumi)<br/>
I hold up my hand to quiet Raphtalia and Sadina.<br/>
"What do you mean what? Doesn’t Naofumi-san already understand? Or did Naofumi-san live in a rural area where power management hadn’t reached yet?" (Itsuki)<br/>
Oh my. He’s answering questions with questions again.<br/>
He should be answering honestly due to his curse, though.<br/>
Currently, he’s speaking expressionlessly in a disinterested voice.<br/>
Does that mean these "Abilities" are obvious facts of life to him?<br/>
It’s as if I just asked him how to breathe.<br/>
If asked such a thing, perhaps this is the natural response.<br/>
"Please. Explain what these powers are from the start." (Naofumi)<br/>
"Understood. Abilities appeared in my world 25 years ago. Various incidents and calamities occurred, and by researching into the cause, it was discovered that each human possessed various abilities. They’re also called PSI and ESP, I think." (Itsuki)<br/>
… Um…<br/>
That means Itsuki’s world is…<br/>
"Ren, did you get that? No, your world had VRMMOs, right? Were ESPers common knowledge?" (Naofumi)<br/>
"There’s no way they existed." (Ren)<br/>
No… I thought that since Ren came from an SF world, he would understand.<br/>
Or perhaps they’re both from modern day fantasies?<br/>
So Itsuki’s world is in the near future, and it has ESP?<br/>
In my world, it would be labeled as Psychic Battle! I would have been excited to go there.<br/>
The problem is just how Itsuki stood in such a world. What powers did he have?<br/>
"And? Itsuki, in your world, how were these powers treated?" (Naofumi)<br/>
"First, all the people with powers were each gathered into schools. There was one per prefecture. Though there were some exceptions." (Itsuki)<br/>
"I see…" (Naofumi)<br/>
Ability users…<br/>
Yeah. I don’t get it.<br/>
"Powers are ranked from F to S, and classes are divided based on that rank. Of course, that also depends on the school." (Itsuki)<br/>
"Did your world contain nothing but power users?" (Naofumi)<br/>
"No, that’s not the case, there were also zeroes. If fact, there were more Zeroes than ESPers." (Itsuki)<br/>
"And you were?" (Naofumi)<br/>
"I was from the E class, with the ability "Accuracy"." (Itsuki)<br/>
Accuracy… is that why he’s the Hero of the Bow?<br/>
How is it? Were there standards for choosing the Heroes?<br/>
Again, I don’t get it.<br/>
"What sort of ability was Accuracy? I just want to confirm." (Naofumi)<br/>
"If you set your aim, you can hit things much easier than normal humans. If needed, I can also act like a sniper from afar." (Itsuki)<br/>
"Ah, I see." (Naofumi)<br/>
So he never misses.<br/>
That’s why during the kidnapping incident, he kept firing at me without minding Melty.<br/>
If he didn’t have absolute confidence, there’s no way he would attack there.<br/>
If so, I guess I can understand his behavior a little bit more.<br/>
Anyways, I don’t feel any doubt from Itsuki’s words, but I’m having trouble believing them.<br/>
"Accuracy", is it?<br/>
Just by looking at it, it has quite a bit of combat capabilities.<br/>
If the ranking is S-F, it’s around the lower end?<br/>
"Even though the ability’s combat ability seems to be high, why is it Rank E?" (Naofumi)<br/>
"Because there is the higher level "Deadly Aim" ability." (Itsuki)<br/>
"What is Deadly Aim?"<br/>
"Naofumi-san was able to interfere when I fired my arrows, but if someone with Deadly Aim shot them, they would hit no matter what." (Itsuki)<br/>
"Hmm…" (Naofumi)<br/>
"No matter which direction they were aimed, the arrows would come flying right at Naofumi-san." (Itsuki)<br/>
So it’s Homing!<br/>
I guess we are dealing with ESP here.<br/>
"It’s a common ability among Baseball Playes. Of course, it is heavily regulated." (Itsuki)<br/>
"So that means, Itsuki, because you had a lower level ability, you were looked down upon within your ESPer School?" (Naofumi)<br/>
"Naofumi, I think you’re saying a bit too much." (Ren)<br/>
"That’s right. That’s why I enthusiastically focused on games to run away from reality." (Itsuki)<br/>
Itsuki boldly answers. I don’t hear any sarcasm or regret.<br/>
So Itsuki’s Idiotic Justice… Hero Complex came from him not being granted a superior ability.<br/>
"I had always known I was special from the special ability screening in elementary school. From middle school onwards, we were all transferred to special schools. But there, I learned that there were plenty of people better than me, and fell into despair. Even in high school, that fact never changed." (Itsuki)<br/>
Since he was surrounded by normal people, Itsuki was filled with confidence when he found out he was special during elementary school<br/>
But when he finally went to the special school, he found out that his power was nothing. He ran to games to console himself.<br/>
In most Manga and Light Novels, the main character has some sort of superior ability.<br/>
However, in an actual society based on special powers, there are people all over the spectrum. It may be hell for the lower people.<br/>
Within his culture of ESPers, he saw numerous people perform amazing feats, and defeating evil. He wished to be like that.<br/>
"I understand what you’re saying. And? I can ride any vehicle without getting sick, and drink however much I want. Are you saying that’s a power?" (Naofumi)<br/>
"Yes. Naofumi-san’s power is probably "Intoxication Cancel". There’s also a lower level version called "Intoxication Resist". The lower one’s F Rank." (Itsuki)<br/>
"Intoxication Cancel is?"<br/>
"Based on the future prospects, I’d say it’s around C-D rank. Against ESPers with gravity and pressure controlling powers, it’s conditionally classified as S." (Itsuki)<br/>
"Hmm. So what do you mean by future prospects?" (Naofumi)<br/>
"Think about it. Being invulnerable to dizziness makes attacks by people who change pressure in set areas ineffective. It also strengthens one’s ears and cochlear fluid. It can change into a skill that lets one act in areas with absolutely no gravity. It’s an essential skill for astronauts. The evolved one is "Gravity Attack Cancel", a strange power. Its full extent has yet to be explored." (Itsuki)<br/>
Was it that great of an ability?<br/>
No no no. I’m just strong against vehicles, and I pretty much was like that in my world as well.<br/>
And I just don’t get drunk, right?<br/>
Is what I think, but even I’m beginning to get my doubts.<br/>
I didn’t feel anything when I stuffed my mouth with the Lucor Fruits that were enough to knock Motoyasu out, and even When Firo runs at her top speed, I’m unaffected.<br/>
Even if the others get used to it, it’s not as if they enjoy it.<br/>
"I also have the suspicion that Naofumi-san has a double skill." (Itsuki)<br/>
"You mean that I have multiple skills?" (Naofumi)<br/>
"Yes." (Itsuki)<br/>
"What else is there?" (Naofumi)<br/>
I don’t really have to listen.<br/>
Itsuki’s world was one set in the near future and ruled by ESP.<br/>
And the reason Itsuki thought he could look down on us was because he thought we were all without abilities I guess. That makes sense.<br/>
Even so, Ren’s world has Virtual Reality, and Itsuki’s had ESpers.<br/>
What does Motoyasu have?<br/>
Whenever he talks to girls, do options appear before his eyes?<br/>
Not that it matters. He’s like that. Even if I ask him, I don’t feel that I’ll get a serious answer.<br/>
"I think you also have "Animal Friends", an ability that attracts animals to you naturally. You’d do fine as a veterinarian." (Itsuki)<br/>
"Ah, I see." (Naofumi)<br/>
"Master~ Pat Firo’s head~" (Firo)<br/>
"Niichan, play~" (Kiel)<br/>
"Hero of the Shield-sama, um…" (Imya)<br/>
The Bird, the Loinclothed Dog, and Imya are swarming around me.<br/>
… I wonder.<br/>
I get the feeling that animals have liked me since I was young.<br/>
When I walked around the mountains, wild birds naturally perched on my shoulders, and I encountered wildlife easily.<br/>
I once encountered a bear, and played dead to try to survive. Rather than attacking, it started licking my face.<br/>
I later learned that playing dead doesn’t actually work.<br/>
When I was in elementary school, the large dog in the neighborhood let me ride on its back.<br/>
No, it’s more like it sat down in front of me asking to be ridden.<br/>
I rode around waving a stick, pretending I was an Ainu Girl from a fighting game.<br/>
(TL: Ainu is a native tribe of Japan. With naturally Reddish hair. This is apparently a reference to Nakoruru from Samurai Spirits)<br/>
The monsters of this world have a wild disposition, so I tend to avoid them, though…<br/>
The monsters in this village are strangely drawn to me. But that must be the power of the Shield.<br/>
Yeah. It’s best not to believe everything Itsuki says.<br/>
He’s talking about his own world, and mine doesn’t come equipped with any such powers.<br/>
"Well, I guess Itsuki’s world is just like that." (Naofumi)<br/>
I think I’ve caught a glimpse of why Itsuki’s personality is as it is.<br/>
I forcefully bring the topic to a close, and signal for Ren to help me drive him out. I turn to Raphtalia.<br/>
"I’ve kept you waiting." (Naofumi)<br/>
"Umm… What were you talking about with the Hero of the Bow? I don’t really get what you mean by ESP and everything." (Raphtalia)<br/>
"Ah, it seems that if you look at Itsuki’s world, it’s not that different from this one." (Naofumi)<br/>
"More importantly, Naofumi-chan, won’t you do something fun with me?" (Sadina)<br/>
"I won’t. I have no interest. Get out." (Naofumi)<br/>
"Oh, Naofumi-chan, but that’s your charm." (Sadina)<br/>
Sadina ignores my rejection, and provokes Raphtalia with challenging eyes.<br/>
I’d appreciate it if you didn’t do that.<br/>
I don’t think Raphtalia wants to witness a love scene, and I’d like to avoid unnecessary things like that until the world is at peace.<br/>
"Sadina-oneesan! You’ve done enough, so please separate from Naofumi-sama!" (Raphtalia)<br/>
"No, Oneesan isn’t going to back down here." (Sadina)<br/>
"Just get away from him!" (Raphtalia)<br/>
"Ah, for the love of god! All of you are being too loud, so everyone besides Raphtalia, get out!" (Naofumi)<br/>
To clear up the misunderstanding with Raphtalia, I drive everyone else out of the room.<br/>
"Ah, Naofumi-sama, you’re being too forceful, And Onii-sama, please go away!" (Atlas)<br/>
"Bu- Master is mean." (Firo)<br/>
"Yeah, Niichan! Make some food." (Kiel)<br/>
Atlas, Firo and the Loinclothed dog offer various complaints as I drive them out, but it’s not my problem.<br/>
I close the door, and once again celebrate my reunion with Raphtalia.<br/>
"I’m sorry. It got very annoying." (Naofumi)<br/>
"Truly, that was a series of surprises." (Raphtalia)<br/>
"Yeah." (Naofumi)<br/>
I look over Raphtalia again.<br/>
Yeah, though I get the feeling she’s become stronger, her face is the same as always.<br/>
"With this, is your training over?" (Naofumi)<br/>
"Yes." (Raphtalia)<br/>
I open Raphtalia’s status. I haven’t checked it in a while.<br/>
Her level is… 100.<br/>
Her journey led her all the way to the max level.<br/>
I need to work hard to catch up.<br/>
"From now on, I can always be with you." (Raphtalia)<br/>
"That helps. There have been too many things happening beyond my power. If Raphtalia’s here, my life would be easier." (Naofumi)<br/>
"Naofumi-sama… I’ll try my best." (Raphtalia)<br/>
"I’m counting on you." (Naofumi)<br/>
I’ve been with her for a long time. She can understand what I want to do, and act based on it.<br/>
"The most pressing matter is… Atlas countermeasures?" (Naofumi)<br/>
Atlas and Sadina are peering in from the window.<br/>
Firo as well.<br/>
… What should I do? It seems that they’ll sneak in regardless of what I do.<br/>
And wait, Atlas is blind, right? Why does she even have to be at the window?<br/>
She can sense whatever happens in here without looking. It’s kinda scary.<br/>
"Naofumi-sama rejects her advances, right?" (Raphtalia)<br/>
"Isn’t it obvious? The one who refuses to learn is Atlas." (Naofumi)<br/>
"I think Fohl-kun will be able to stop them." (Raphtalia)<br/>
"I have doubts as to whether he’ll stop Sadina as well." (Naofumi)<br/>
"Right…" (Raphtalia)<br/>
"And so, Raphtalia." (Naofumi)<br/>
"W-what is it?" (Raphtalia)<br/>
"From tonight onwards, you’re on guard duty. I’m leaving it to you." (Naofumi)<br/>
"Y-yes!" (Raphtalia)<br/>
For some reason, Raphtalia’s face is red as she nods.<br/>
Did I say something strange?<br/>
If I leave it to Raphtalia, who seems strict on public morals, I think I’ll finally be able to sleep.<br/>
"Well, from here on out, I’ll be doing my morning warm up, and then I’m going to make breakfast. Won’t you accompany me?" (Naofumi)<br/>
"Understood." (Raphtalia)<br/>
And so, Raphtalia joined me in my daily routine, and I resumed my work.<br/>
