Chapter 33 - Peddling <br/>
 <br/>
The next day, that childish otaku greeted us with a smile when we enter the dress shop. <br/>
 <br/>
"Yes, it's here. The clothes have been made. It took me all night." <br/>
 <br/>
The tired dressmaker was ready to split, her eyes giving a tension-filled, red-eyed stare. She then brought Firo's clothes from the back of the shop. <br/>
[TL note: "red-eyed gaze" is placement for "gingin" which describes a tired stare with red eyes] <br/>
 <br/>
The dress's colour is mainly white. The colour blue contrasts it in some areas and decorating the middle is a large ribbon of the same hue. It can be seen as rustic and old-styled, but it's very beautiful all the same. <br/>
 <br/>
Firo: "Master, I'm going to wear this?"  <br/>
[Edt: I changed “Goshujin-sama” to “Master” since “Master” is commonly used ltr.] <br/>
Naofumi: "Yeah." <br/>
Firo: "Yay!" <br/>
 <br/>
Firo, who had worn a cloak to cover herself until now, became nude on the spot. <br/>
 <br/>
Raphtalia: "Firo, no!" <br/>
Firo: "Eh--" <br/>
 <br/>
With Raphtalia urging her to stop, I guided them both to the back of the shop. <br/>
I was waiting for you to come get dressed in here... <br/>
 <br/>
 <br/>
Sales Clerk: "Alright, change into your demon form." <br/>
[Weaver=Sales Clerk= Dressmaker, for standardisation, I’ll be using Sales Clerk] <br/>
 <br/>
I could hear the dressmaker's voice from the depths of the store. <br/>
 <br/>
Firo: "Why~?" <br/>
Sales Clerk: "If you wear this ribbon, I'll give you meat." <br/>
Firo: "Yay!" <br/>
 <br/>
Don't just casually say something so terrifying. <br/>
 <br/>
Firo: "Understood~" <br/>
 <br/>
I could hear the transformation sounds. <br/>
 <br/>
Sales Clerk: "Yup. As I thought you look good..." <br/>
 <br/>
I could hear an enchanted voice. <br/>
 <br/>
Sales Clerk?: "Alright, let's go." <br/>
Firo: "Ok!" <br/>
 <br/>
The two girls appeared from the back of the store. <br/>
My eyes turned towards Firo. <br/>
Alright, her figure which was already angel-like is even more stunning. <br/>
Pure white wings, matching the white one piece... And a blue ribbon on her chest. What was it? <br/>
Right, she looks like an angel heroine from the 2-D world. <br/>
 <br/>
Firo: "Master~?" <br/>
Naofumi: "Hm?" <br/>
Firo: "Well? Does it suit me?" <br/>
Naofumi: "Yea, it suits you." <br/>
 <br/>
This otaku dressmaker is able to take full advantage of Firo's specs and make suitable clothing for her. Her talent is quite outstanding. <br/>
 <br/>
Firo: "Ehehe" <br/>
 <br/>
An embarrass Firo laughs while her clothes flutter. <br/>
Seriously, what a terrible expenditure. <br/>
I let Firo pull the cart while we head back to Forest village. <br/>
When Firo changes to her demon form, the clothes dispensary and the ribbon turns into a collar. <br/>
[Do you mean “disperse” when you used “dispensary”? I googled the meaning, so it doesn’t seems to fit in there.] <br/>
That function is very convenient. <br/>
 <br/>
Magic Shop SK: "Oh, it’s Hero of the Shield-sama" <br/>
 <br/>
Before we leave the castle town, we coincidentally meet with the aunty from the magic shop. <br/>
 <br/>
Magic Shop SK: "Are you heading to Forest village? <br/>
Naofumi: "Yeah" <br/>
Magic Shop SK: "I happen to have some business there too. May I tag along?" <br/>
 <br/>
The aunty from the magic shop asked with a smile. <br/>
Oh well, I don't really want to decline her since she has helped us out with various things. <br/>
 <br/>
Naofumi: "I don't guarantee it being comfortable, is that fine?" <br/>
Magic Shop SK: "Yeah" <br/>
 <br/>
Raphtalia looks ahead and already starts fighting against motion sickness. <br/>
 <br/>
Magic Shop SK: "Well then, let's get going." <br/>
 <br/>
The magic shop aunty gets on the cart. <br/>
 <br/>
Naofumi: "Good, Firo. Don't go too fast." <br/>
Firo: "Okay~" <br/>
 <br/>
The pedestrians who pass by look at Firo with surprise. Talking demons are probably rare. <br/>
The cart rolls along with a pitter-patter. <br/>
I feel that in these past few days, I have been really busy. <br/>
Actually, I'm usually busy, it's just that recently have been especially busy. <br/>
The whole situation could be summed up with Firo... <br/>
 <br/>
Magic Shop SK: "So, how's your study of magic going?" <br/>
Naofumi: "Uh..." <br/>
 <br/>
The magic shop aunty attacks where it hurts. <br/>
To be frank, I made no progress at all. <br/>
Should I retort with a "you should have given me a crystal ball"? No, she helped procure the threads to make Firo's clothes at a discount, I can't complain. <br/>
 <br/>
Naofumi: "Because I am from another world, I can't read these letters." <br/>
Magic Shop SK: "Oh... I'm sorry." <br/>
 <br/>
I felt bad to seeing her apologise. I lament at my insufficient studying. <br/>
I was defeated. <br/>
I repaid a good intention with bad feelings. <br/>
Therefore, I want to repay aunty for the help. <br/>
I must learn it as fast as possible. <br/>
I don't have any support, unlike the other fucking heroes. That's why I have to do my best to learn. <br/>
Also, I need to acquire better equipments to survive the next wave. <br/>
Let's not forget about translating the medical recipes either. <br/>
Though it would take a lot of time, I decided to learn the letters first. <br/>
 <br/>
Firo: "Fuaa... it's light" <br/>
 <br/>
Firo was yawning while pulling the cart steadily. <br/>
You're calling a cart with 3 people light? <br/>
That's great. I already have a certain plan. This can't be done without Firo. <br/>
 <br/>
The aunty from the magic shop gives me 25 coppers when we arrive at Forest Village. <br/>
 <br/>
Naofumi: "What's this for?" <br/>
Magic Shop SK: "Transportation fee" <br/>
Naofumi: "Oh I see." <br/>
 <br/>
I can use this.  <br/>
Forest village is reviving nicely. A storekeeper welcomes us pleasantly. <br/>
I have already apologised for the chimera meat. <br/>
Although keeping that meat there was my idea in the first place. <br/>
 <br/>
Naofumi: "Now then, Raphtalia, let's go on some motion sickness training." <br/>
 <br/>
I promised to help with the reconstruction to compensate for the meat. Although it's only a little I still get some compensation. <br/>
 <br/>
Raphtalia: "Eh!?" <br/>
 <br/>
Raphtalia has a bitter face. Oh dear, it's not good if you can't overcome something like this. <br/>
 <br/>
Naofumi:"From now on, our transportation is Firo pulling the cart, so you must get used to it." <br/>
Raphtalia: "O-Okay" <br/>
Firo: "Okay~!" <br/>
Naofumi: "Firo, you’re pulling." <br/>
Firo: "Yup!" <br/>
 <br/>
Philorials really like pulling carts. Firo's eye shines. <br/>
 <br/>
Raphtalia: "Uhm......Are you thinking of something?" <br/>
Naofumi: "Yeah, I think we should start peddling." <br/>
Raphtalia: "Peddling? Why?" <br/>
Naofumi: "Although we don't have a lot of goods, I want to stock up on an assortment of medicine." <br/>
Raphtalia: "Sigh......" <br/>
 <br/>
Raphtalia doesn't seem to see the appeal. Oh dear, do I have too high expectations? However, to have such a precious cart, it's a waste not to make full use of it. <br/>
 <br/>
Naofumi: "Though when you get used to the motion sickness, Firo can pull the cart everywhere at maximum speed." <br/>
Raphtalia: "I understand the reason..." <br/>
Naofumi: "I know a place that would make it hard to get drunk. You should get accustomed there." <br/>
Raphtalia: "Is there really such a place?" <br/>
Naofumi: "Yeah" <br/>
 <br/>
Before starting the today, we head to the place where it is hard to get drunk. I told Raphtalia to get on Firo. <br/>
(Tl note: I have no fucking idea with the drunk. 俺はラフタリアを酔いにくい場所 help.) <br/>
 <br/>
Firo: "I'm fine with master, but why is Onee-chan on my back?" <br/>
 <br/>
Firo muttered as Raphtalia gets on her back. <br/>
 <br/>
Raphtalia: "It's the same for me. This is embarrassing." <br/>
 <br/>
It's a strange sight to see Raphtalia in a semi-crouching position on top of Firo's owl shaped body. <br/>
 <br/>
Naofumi: "Is it hard?" <br/>
Firo: "Nope, this is easy." <br/>
 <br/>
Firo seems to have no problems at all. <br/>
 <br/>
Naofumi: "Well then, let's go." <br/>
Firo: "Ok!" <br/>
 <br/>
Firo pulls the cart with Raphtalia on her back. <br/>
Her weight shouldn't be too heavy. <br/>
I began decoding the book of Intermediate recipes while learning the letters. <br/>
 <br/>
Rumble... <br/>
Rumble...... <br/>
It is difficult to concentrate with the sound of a wheel as background music. <br/>
 <br/>
Raphtalia: "Uhmm..." <br/>
 <br/>
Rumble……… <br/>
 <br/>
Raphtalia: "Uh-Uhmm…" <br/>
 <br/>
Hm? <br/>
I looked at Firo and see her in human form piggybacking Raphtalia. Raphtalia seems troubled and tried to get my attention while the passers-by whisper and point at us. <br/>
 <br/>
Naofumi: "A strange rumour is going to circulate!" <br/>
 <br/>
My reputation is going to drop again because there is going to be a rumour that I forced a slave girl to do manual labour by pulling a cart and carrying another person. <br/>
 <br/>
Naofumi?: "Well..." <br/>
Naofumi: "When you pull a cart, do not turn into a humanoid." <br/>
Firo: "Okay" <br/>
 <br/>
Firo nods and seemingly dissatisfied returns to her demon form. <br/>
I'm getting bored. Raphtalia doesn't seem to have motion sickness yet. <br/>
It will probably be okay if we go faster. <br/>
 <br/>
Naofumi: "Alright, Speed up!" <br/>
Firo: "Okay~!" <br/>
 <br/>
Firo nods energetically and begins running. <br/>
GaraGaraGara! <br/>
The wheels on the cart turn noisily. <br/>
 <br/>
Raphtalia: "Wa!" <br/>
 <br/>
Raphtalia was surprised and clings to Firo. <br/>
At least, we will arrive at our destination today.
