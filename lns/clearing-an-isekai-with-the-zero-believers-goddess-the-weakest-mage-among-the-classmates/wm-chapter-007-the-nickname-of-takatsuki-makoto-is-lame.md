<br/>
TLN: Hey guys, Reigokai here!<br/>
I hope you guys are enjoying the story. From here on for this whole week, I will be releasing a chapter each day. A bit of a boost for being a new story you could say.<br/>
Enjoy! :DD!<br/>
<br/>
"Ooh, the rising rookie. The Goblin Cleaner has returned." <br/>
"Good work in your daily cleaning of weaklings." <br/>
"Aim big every now and then, man." <br/>
"Nah, he can’t. He is a Mage Apprentice." <br/>
"Moreover, solo." <br/>
"There’s no way there’s a Mage Apprentice that goes solo." <br/>
"There’s one right here."<br/>
"""Ahahahaha."""<br/>
The moment I returned to the Adventurer Guild, jeering flew my way.<br/>
Why did it turn out this way…<br/>
◇◇<br/>
3 months have passed since I became an adventurer.<br/>
I safely managed to deliver the Horned Rabbits for my first quest.<br/>
On top of that, I reported the subjugation of 5 goblins.<br/>
The guild lady went ‘Huh? No way’.<br/>
And then, got amazed at me for being so reckless.<br/>
I don’t think I was reckless there though.<br/>
After feeling good surprising the guild receptionist, I defeated goblins the next day as well.<br/>
After 2 weeks, I managed to wipe out the goblin colony that I found.<br/>
This became news in the Adventurer Guild for a short while.<br/>
They pressed me with questions about where the goblin colony was, and when I answered that it was close to the Demonic Forest, they accepted it.<br/>
There’s a lot of goblins around there, so there’s no problems. If it had been anywhere else, an investigation would be required as to why they are outside their usual territory.<br/>
But I was warned that I shouldn’t be so reckless, since the Demonic Forest is way too dangerous for a Stone Rank. Telling me that I shouldn’t worry, that they will promote me to Bronze Rank soon, so there’s no need to hurry it like that.<br/>
It seems they thought I was pushing myself because I wanted to raise my adventurer rank.<br/>
My objective is to raise my level and increase my lifespan though.<br/>
I am not putting that much importance to adventurer rank.<br/>
Even if I raise my adventurer rank, I am made fun of by the other adventurers just because I am a Mage Apprentice anyways…<br/>
When I raise my level, my stats increase.<br/>
Things like Strength, Endurance, and Mana.<br/>
If I raise my stats, I will be receiving less wounds, which is something that comes with the job of being an adventurer.<br/>
Increasing my level is of utmost importance if I want to survive.<br/>
Goblins are dangerous monsters that attack people, so getting Contribution Points for defeating them makes me happy.<br/>
Horn Rabbits and Giant Rats don’t give points.<br/>
When I increase my CP <Contribution Points>, my lifespan increases.<br/>
My lifespan is still around 10 years.<br/>
No choice but to slowly earn it.<br/>
Increasing my level is fun.<br/>
In RPG games, the moment when my level increases is the moment where my spirit raises the most.<br/>
More so in this Isekai.<br/>
Once you get used to goblin hunting, it is easy.<br/>
The risk is low, and I can steadily increase my level. <br/>
I hunted a whole lot of goblins close to the Demonic Forest when I found them.<br/>
As a result, I was being called Goblin Cleaner…<br/>
That’s lame.<br/>
If you are going to give me a nickname, make it something cool.<br/>
"You guys, at least acknowledge goblin hunting a little bit. He is doing his best alone, you know." <br/>
"Then invite him to your party."<br/>
"Oi oi, an apprentice that can only use water magic? Where can I use him?" <br/>
"Damn right. Hahahaha!" <br/>
I heard a distasteful conversation.<br/>
Let’s ignore them.<br/>
"Boss, a plate of skewers." (Makoto)<br/>
"On its way." <br/>
I sat on a bench in front of a food stall inside the guild, and gave my order to the stallkeeper.<br/>
"What will you be drinking?" <br/>
"Apple soda." (Makoto)<br/>
In this stall, ordering skewers and alcohol is the usual.<br/>
But I don’t like alcoholic drinks.<br/>
I always go for soft drinks. <br/>
"Also, rice balls." (Makoto)<br/>
"Got it." <br/>
While waiting for the skewers to be ready, I munch on the salty taste of the rice balls.<br/>
It is a bit harder compared to the rice of Japan.<br/>
The scent of cooking meat was tickling my appetite.<br/>
There’s a variety of other stalls in the guild, but this is my favorite one.<br/>
The taste is close to that of the yakitori in Japan.<br/>
I heard that this taste was spread a long time ago by otherwordlers.<br/>
Maybe they were japanese?<br/>
"Here you go, plate of skewers, right on." <br/>
A plate of 5 skewers was placed in front of me.<br/>
The meat is from the Horn Rabbits you can get at the Great Forest.<br/>
My very first delivery quest was from this stall.<br/>
Since then, I have been a frequent customer.<br/>
I munch on the sweet and sour taste of the leg meat skewer. <br/>
The meat juice spreads inside my mouth.<br/>
"It is delicious as always." (Makoto)<br/>
"Thanks. By the way, how was today’s hunt?" <br/>
I am acquainted with the boss, so we could converse casually.<br/>
"22 goblins, and 5 horned rabbits. I told them to send the meat to your place." (Makoto)<br/>
"Thanks as always, Makoto. You can have your drink for free." <br/>
This is the usual exchange as well.<br/>
"But I am surprised that you can hunt goblins all the time without getting bored. What level are you now?" <br/>
"Around 14. I am going to go at it till 20." (Makoto)<br/>
"What a weird guy you are. A level 20 is considered a full-fledged adventurer already, you know? In my days…" <br/>
The boss here was apparently an adventurer in the past and was over level 40.<br/>
He was a warrior, but because of a wound on his leg, he retired. <br/>
He sometimes talks about stories of his adventurer times, so it helps as reference.<br/>
"Ooh, talking a storm here. Boss, ale and skewers please." <br/>
"Got it. Lucas, you were back, huh." <br/>
A large sized warrior old man sat at my side.<br/>
"I went to the Fire Country to defeat a Sand Dragon. We were prohibited from drinking any alcohol. The reward was good, but it was rough. Ooh, Makoto, long time no see." (Lucas)<br/>
"It’s only been 5 days. Good work out there." (Makoto)<br/>
"Alright, cheers. Puhaaa~, delicious!" (Lucas)<br/>
Lucas-san is a veteran adventurer in Makkaren, and he is Gold Rank.<br/>
It seems he is an old friend of the boss. <br/>
And he is also an instructor for newbies in a sense.<br/>
He taught me a lot of things at the beginning.<br/>
"Makoto, how about challenging a dungeon soon. You are close to level 15, right?" (Lucas)<br/>
"When I get to 20, I am thinking about challenging the dungeon for newbies that’s close by." (Makoto)<br/>
"The recommended level there is 10-12 though…" (Lucas)<br/>
"I am weak after all. I will go at it carefully." (Makoto)<br/>
I didn’t say anything weird, and yet, Boss and Lucas were looking at each other.<br/>
"What’s with this rookie?" <br/>
"There’s nothing to caution him about as a veteran." <br/>
Ain’t it fine to be careful?<br/>
"Ooh, you are already gulping it down here, people." <br/>
A blonde and beautiful lady inserted herself in between Lucas-san and I. <br/>
"Mary-san, thanks for the hard work. Are you done for today?" (Makoto)<br/>
"What’s with you, Mary, don’t get in between us." (Lucas)<br/>
Mary-san is the receptionist of the Adventurer Guild.<br/>
Since the time of my first quest, I have met her a lot. <br/>
She likes to look after the newbies. <br/>
Also, she is a hopeless alcoholic, and when she finishes work, she would always come here to have a drink.<br/>
Thanks to that, getting involved with her has become a daily occurrence.<br/>
I am just having dinner without any alcohol involved though.<br/>
"One ale for me. Also, roast me some vegetables there!" (Mary)<br/>
"Got it." <br/>
"Well then, cheers~. Haah. The first drink after work is really the best." (Mary)<br/>
"Ooh, Mary, how about instead of drinking in this dirty stall, you get a man, and go to a stylish bar?" (Lucas)<br/>
"Huh? Lucas-san, you know how exhausting it is to work as a receptionist of the Adventurer Guild, right?! I don’t have the time to get a man. Old man, another one." (Mary)<br/>
"Mary-san, you are drinking too fast." (Makoto)<br/>
She is a beauty when she stays silent though…<br/>
Mary-san is one heavy-drinker that doesn’t lose to adventurers.<br/>
"Aah, Makoto-kun! Drinking juice again. You got a decent pay today, so you gotta drink a whole lot, you know." (Mary)<br/>
"Oi oi, what is a guild staff saying?" <br/>
The Boss is amazed by her.<br/>
"I do drink every now and then, you know." (Makoto)<br/>
You can drink alcohol when you are over 13 years old in this country.<br/>
So there’s no issue in me drinking, but I don’t like alcohol to begin with.<br/>
The ale I drank in my first time was simply bitter, and the one on the rocks I ordered, I spat it out the moment it entered my mouth.<br/>
The only thing I can drink are things like cocktails made from apple soda.<br/>
And I get immediately drunk even with that, so I keep it to only 1.<br/>
There’s no need to push myself to drink, but Lucas-san told me that if an adventurer can’t drink alcohol, they will get looked down on.<br/>
"Why only every now and then?" (Mary)<br/>
"Like a reward after working hard? Also, drinking alcohol moderately helps me relieve a bit of stress." (Makoto)<br/>
Not like I have accumulated stress though.<br/>
Raising my level as I go has been incredibly fun.<br/>
"Oi, Mary, did you hear that?" (Lucas)<br/>
"My, you are really level-headed. Boss, another one~." (Mary)<br/>
"Here ya go. Mary, how about you learn from him a bit and don’t drink everyday? Not like I should be the one saying it." <br/>
"Why is it that this boy is so young, yet so mature. That’s not cute~, take this and this." (Mary) <br/>
She head-locked me. Her big boobs pushed against my back.<br/>
Awawa.<br/>
[Clear Mind] activate!<br/>
Be cool, be cool.<br/>
Mary-san is popular with the adventurers.<br/>
Because of that, I can feel the jealous stares of the adventurers gathering onto me.<br/>
"Tch." "That bastard." "Even though he is a weakling mage." <br/>
I heard those words of disdain.<br/>
I have done nothing wrong.<br/>
"Mary-san, you are way too drunk." (Makoto)<br/>
"I am not drunk at all just yet~. It begins from here on~." (Mary)<br/>
She is hugging me from the back now?!<br/>
"Today it was 22 goblins? Well done, well done." (Mary)<br/>
She dishevels my hair while still hugging me.<br/>
When Mary-san gets drunk, her physical contact increases.<br/>
Because of that, it makes others misunderstand easily, and there have been many adventurers who have fallen for her.<br/>
A devilish woman.<br/>
But! I am the man that resisted the seduction of a Goddess.<br/>
I won’t panic over something like this.<br/>
*Boing*<br/>
Soft things were being pushed on my back.<br/>
W-Won’t panic!<br/>
Aah, soft…<br/>
"Ha! Acting all big just from hunting goblins." <br/>
Someone speaks out.<br/>
I look back and see a young man in warrior equipment.<br/>
A newcomer adventurer by the name of Jean, was it?<br/>
He apparently became an adventurer around half a year ago.<br/>
His current rank is bronze.<br/>
It is apparently quite the speed to be promoted in half a year.<br/>
But it seems like he doesn’t like the fact that I have become Bronze Rank in the three months I came to the Adventurer Guild, and would bother me every now and then.<br/>
"Oi, Jean, get along with each other as newcomers." (Lucas)<br/>
"Lucas-san! Why haven’t you been helping me with practice lately?!" (Jean)<br/>
"I look after Stone Ranks, but Bronze up are treated as being fully-fleshed already." (Lucas)<br/>
"Don’t be like that, Jean-kun. Don’t go scaring Makoto-kun just because he is docile." (Mary)<br/>
I am not really scared.<br/>
No, I wonder.<br/>
There’s a mage and a priest at the back of Jean.<br/>
A party of 3?<br/>
Honestly, a 1 vs 3 is scary, so I will keep it down.<br/>
"Isn’t it okay? He is a mage apprentice. I don’t think you need to bother. You are an Intermediate Swordsman, right?" <br/>
The one who spoke to Jean was the red haired female mage.<br/>
She is wearing clothes with quite the high exposure.<br/>
What a flashy beauty.<br/>
"Right right, let’s finish the subjugation quest already and aim for Iron Rank." <br/>
Is what the priest girl said.<br/>
The one here is a bit child-faced and more on the cute side.<br/>
A harem party, huh…<br/>
Tch!<br/>
A man should shut up and go solo. <br/>
"Oh, a subjugation quest?! Who are you going against?" (Lucas)<br/>
Lucas-san changes the topic.<br/>
"Ogre subjugation! Travellers have spotted it recently it seems." (Jean)<br/>
"Hoh! A Bronze Rank party against an ogre, huh. It is like a promotion ceremony. Do your best!" (Lucas)<br/>
"Yes! I will show you we can! Oi, Makoto! I will be the first one to become an Iron Rank, you got it?!" (Jean)<br/>
He left after saying that.<br/>
The priest girl lowered her head apologetically.<br/>
The priest girl is a good girl.<br/>
The mage girl seems to not have any interest here.<br/>
"No need to mind it." (Mary)<br/>
Mary-san consoles me.<br/>
No, I really am not minding it, you know.<br/>
"I will go at my own pace." (Makoto)<br/>
I will be defeating goblins tomorrow as usual.<br/>
"Just for your information, defeating 22 goblins alone in one day cannot be called ‘my own pace’." (Lucas)<br/>
Lucas-san retorted.<br/>
Even if you tell me that, I have secured a safe hunting pattern.<br/>
In RPGs, I am the type that raises their level as much as possible before defeating the boss. <br/>
I will be doing it in this way for a while.<br/>
◇◇<br/>
The next day, on my way back from hunting goblins.<br/>
Today I got 20.<br/>
After this, I was thinking about hunting some horn rabbits on my way back, and sending them to the stall of Boss. <br/>
*Kan kan kan kan!*<br/>
Suddenly a siren from Detection rings inside my head in a loud volume.<br/>
There’s quite the dangerous monster around?<br/>
I currently have Stealth activated. <br/>
It is okay, they shouldn’t have found me yet.<br/>
I silently check my surroundings.<br/>
There’s something.<br/>
Around 50 meters ahead, inside the mist, there’s a giant shadow.<br/>
A stray ogre?<br/>
It has a wide and stout humanoid figure, and there’s something like a horn at its head.<br/>
But…isn’t it way too big?<br/>
The average ogre is around 2-3 metres. <br/>
This one is over 5 metres.<br/>
Each step it takes makes a heavy sound, and I think the ground around it was trembling along.<br/>
There’s normally other monsters around this area, but right now I can’t see any at all.<br/>
They all ran away.<br/>
I won’t be able to get any horn rabbits like this.<br/>
I should go back to the guild and report it.<br/>
The moment I was about to leave the place silently…<br/>
"Kyaaa!!" <br/>
I heard the scream of a woman.<br/>
"Damn it! This guy!!" <br/>
The shout of a man.<br/>
(Oi oi, there’s people being attacked.) (Makoto)<br/>
Now that I look closely, there’s a number of adventurer-like people there.<br/>
A swordsman, mage, and priest; a party of 3.<br/>
They are all young.<br/>
Doesn’t look like they are veteran adventurers.<br/>
"Or more like, it is them, huh." (Makoto)<br/>
The party of Jean that came to bother me yesterday.<br/>
He did say he would go subjugate an ogre.<br/>
And now he is in trouble.<br/>
Got what you deserved…is what I want to say, but it would be dangerous if I get dragged into it, too.<br/>
I maintain Stealth and observe.<br/>
(They are going to run away, right?) (Makoto)<br/>
The iron rule of adventurers is ‘life is important’.<br/>
When an enemy stronger than you appears, just run!<br/>
Lucas-san warned me a whole lot in the past.<br/>
They should have been told that too.<br/>
(The mage and priest are in a terrible state.) (Makoto)<br/>
Maybe because of fear, or hesitation, they cannot properly escape.<br/>
The ogre is going to catch up.<br/>
"Emily!" (Jean)<br/>
Jean grabs the hand of the girl and runs.<br/>
"Wait! What about me?!" <br/>
The mage shouts.<br/>
It looks like the priest is more important for Jean.<br/>
(What a rough world.) (Makoto)<br/>
Aah, the mage tripped on her confusion.<br/>
The ogre is getting closer.<br/>
This is bad.<br/>
Abandon ←<br/>
Save<br/>
Oi oi, no matter how you think about it, this is too heavy for a bronze rank mage apprentice.<br/>
I heard a voice inside my head.<br/>
(Abandon her.) <br/>
A simple instruction.<br/>
But isn’t there a better way to put it, Goddess-sama?<br/>
Abandon ←<br/>
Save<br/>
The choices begin to flicker.<br/>
How annoying! <br/>
Let me think for a bit here!<br/>
If I die, it would all be over, you know?! <br/>
"Hiih! Stay away." <br/>
The mage has lost strength on her legs.<br/>
The ogre is really close now.<br/>
Jean was shouting to the female mage, ‘run away already!’.<br/>
The female priest is covering her mouth and making a bitter expression.<br/>
No good.<br/>
This is not the time to think.<br/>
"Noo noo! Save me!" <br/>
The scream of the female mage rang weakly, and the hand of the giant ogre stretches towards her.<br/>
Aah, geez!<br/>
"[Water Magic: Ice Blade]!" (Makoto)<br/>
Ice Blade hit the ogre’s eye.<br/>
The ogre went ‘gyaaaa!’ and covered its eye in pain.<br/>
"Oi, run away quickly." (Makoto)<br/>
"Eh, ah, wa?" <br/>
Looks like the female mage is in complete confusion right now.<br/>
I had gone in between the ogre and the female mage, and had taken a stance with the Goddess’s dagger.<br/>
(If you die, I won’t forgive you.) (Noa)<br/>
I heard the fed up voice from the Goddess.<br/>
I am sorry. <br/>
I want to act cool.<br/>
