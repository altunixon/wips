Chapter 54.1 : Rescue Mission<br/>
◆Sword Maiden, Shirone<br/>
Going to Republic Ariadya was simple enough. Chiyuki-san prepared a Dimension Gate that led to the heart of Rena Temple, located in Republic Ariadya. However, we’ve never travelled through the Dimension Gate before. Because, in order to prepare the Dimension Gate, a room large enough to make the magic circle is needed.<br/>
Rena Temple was perfect for this. That’s why, unless there was a similar place in other countries, we couldn’t go there using the Dimension Gate. Perhaps, Veros Kingdom would be a good fit as well.<br/>
As for why Chiyuki refused to do so, it was apparently to keep Reiji-kun’s frivolous nature in check.<br/>
Well, that’s what she told me, not like I understand why she meant by it though.<br/>
The reason we constructed a Dimension Gate to Republic Ariadya was because the country was extremely wealthy. So Chiyuki-san wanted to turn into a second base for us.<br/>
「In short,you guys went back after escorting Reiji-kun till the 4th floor…」<br/>
「Yes, Shirone-sama.」<br/>
I was questioning a girl called Leylia.<br/>
It was strange to have a girl who was supposedly older than me, kneel in front of me.<br/>
. Leila was the priest of Republic Ariadya’s Rena Temple. And currently, we’re in one of the rooms of the said temple.<br/>
Not a lot of people worshipped Rena in Republic Ariadya, thus the temple was much smaller when compared to Oudith’s Temple.<br/>
Ariadya was a large country. Each city had about ten thousand citizens. Temples of various gods were spread throughout the country, with several priests working in each temple. Rena Temple had several dozen priests, who were led by the great priest. Leylia was one of these priests. However, she didn’t work in the temple.<br/>
Leylia was an apostle. Rena was a goddess who protected humans from demons. Thus, many priests often became an apostle, who left the temple and went out to exterminate demons. In order to exterminate them in an efficient manner, she became a freedom fighter.<br/>
We came to Republic Ariadya and met Leylia.<br/>
I heard that she lived in the Freedom City of Teseshia, located in the north, and rarely visited Republic Ariadya. But she was here right now, and the reason for that was the person who turned Leylia into an apostle, Rena’s Valkyrie. The Valkyrie ordered Leylia to cooperate with us.<br/>
And so, we came to Republic Ariadya and met Leylia.<br/>
She, her party, and severals party of freedom fighters were the one who became the guide for Reiji-kun in the Evil God’s Labyrinth.<br/>
She was currently kneeling in front of us along with the great priest in this room.<br/>
She, her party and several other freedom fighters were the ones who guided Reiji-kun in the Evil God’s Labyrinth. Right now, she was kneeling in front of us along with the great priest of the temple.<br/>
「I see, then may I ask you to guide me till the 4th floor too? 」<br/>
I asked leylia.<br/>
「Please wait a minute, Shirone-sama! ! 」<br/>
Kaya-san, who was waiting on the side suddenly interrupted.<br/>
「What’s the matter, Kaya? 」<br/>
Kyouka-san was surprised by Kaya-san’s sudden interruption too.<br/>
「Milady, Shirone-sama. Our opponent is someone who captured Reiji-sama. Entering the base of such a cunning opponent without any kind of plan might put your life in danger.」<br/>
「But, Kaya-san! If we don’t hurry, then Reiji and the other’s lives will be in danger!  .」<br/>
「That’s right, Kaya. If we don’t leave immediately, then Onii-sama might lose his life.」<br/>
Kyouka-san agreed with me.<br/>
But, Kaya-san shook her head.<br/>
「You must not be hasty, Milady. There’s still time till Reiji-sama’s execution. We might be able to pull off something till then.」<br/>
「Even if you say so… Who do you think can help us in this situation, Kaya-san?! 」<br/>
I unintentionally shouted at Kaya-san.<br/>
Her reasoning was rational, but I ended up losing my cool.<br/>
「It’s going to be impossible to rescue them if we only rely on our own power. Our enemy has captured both Chiyuki-sama and Reiji-sama. If we recklessly storm the enemy’s base, we’ll end up getting captured as well.」<br/>
Kaya-san spoke with an indifferent voice.<br/>
She was  right.<br/>
Reiji-kun and Chiyuki-san were strong.<br/>
If I enter the labyrinth without any sort of strategy, I’ll end up getting captured in vain.<br/>
But, I knew that I had to do something about this situation.<br/>
Now that I think about it, I always recklessly charge into a situation without thinking first. This must be why Kuroki’s always worrying about my safety.<br/>
「That… Is there really nothing we can do in this situation, Kaya? 」<br/>
Kaya-san shook her head. Even she didn’t know what to do in this situation.<br/>
「Our power alone isn’t enough. That’s why we have to ask someone else for help.」<br/>
As she spoke, Kaya looked at Regena.<br/>
Regena was right here with us. For some reason, Kaya brought her along from Holy Republic Lenaria.<br/>
「Uhm, what’s the matter? 」<br/>
Regena was startled as she felt everyone in the room gaze at her.<br/>
「Regena-san. Can you ask for Kuroki-sama’s help? 」<br/>
Upon hearing her words, Kyouka-san and I were at a loss for words.<br/>
I see. So, the reason why Kaya-san brought Regena-san along was because she knew that we wouldn’t be able to save Reiji-kun on our own. Thus, she realized we needed Kuroki’s help.<br/>
Yes, Kuroki is certainly a powerful and reliable ally. His power is equivalent to that of a thousand armies. Regena still has some connections with Kuroki, so she should be able to contact him.<br/>
Why didn’t I think of this idea? Even though I should’ve been the first one to think about this, my stupid mind didn’t even consider this as an option.<br/>
「 Master’s help, it is? That’s impossible. Reiji-sama is my master’s and Nargol’s enemy, after all. Why must he go through all this trouble to save his enemy?」<br/>
Regena replied as she kept her eyes on the floor.<br/>
「. E-enemy? It’s not like Kuroki is our enemy. He’s Nargol’s ally only because of that witch, Kuna.」<br/>
Despite my words, Regena still rejected our plea.<br/>
「Shirone-sama. I won’t let him go to such a place. From what I know, the labyrinth’s extremely dangerous, and you’re telling me to ask my master to enter such a place? 」<br/>
. Regena turned her face away from us.<br/>
Despite Regena’s rejection, Kaya-san smiled. However, the smile seemed to be a scheming one.<br/>
「Hey, Regena-san. Shouldn’t you use this chance to meet Kuroki-san？Aren’t you the one benefitting from this situation?」<br/>
Kaya’s words left her dumbfounded.<br/>
「 Ugh… How sly. Do you think I won’t refuse if you say that…? Fine. I’ll contact my master, but whether or not he accepts is up to him.」<br/>
Reluctantly, Regena agreed with a downcast look.<br/>
「Fufu~ Thank you very much, Regena-san.」<br/>
Kaya-san spoke with elation.<br/>
Seeing her like that hurt my conscience for some reason. However, seeing her act like that made my heart ache for some reason. Why did Kuroki teach Regena how to contact him? Why didn’t he teach me instead? I felt that Kuroki was being unfair. I should’ve been the person to be taught this first!<br/>
But… I can meet Kuroki again this way. Although I felt bad for Reiji-kun and Chiyuki-san, I was happy that I had the chance to meet him again.<br/>
◆Dark Knight, Kuroki<br/>
I was on my way to visit Heibos’s abode. I always pass by his place whenever I visit Totona’s library, but I never went inside to greet him since he didn’t like to be bothered for no reason.<br/>
Which is why I ended up missing the news of Nut getting captured along with the hero and his party.<br/>
Heibos’s parlor room was extremely messy, to the point that it looked like a warehouse. And currently, I was in the middle of the room, talking to Heibos.<br/>
「 I see… That underground place, huh? Well, it’s called a labyrinth now. You’re going to that place?」<br/>
Heibos talked with a displeased expression, as if he was recalling something unpleasant.<br/>
According to the emerald tablet, the labyrinth was the greatest cause of humiliation for Heibos. That’s why, it was a taboo to mention the labyrinth in his presence, to the point that no one in Elios dared to talk about it in front of him in fear of his wrath. However, even amongst the dwarvens, very few were aware of why he was so angry about it. Not even could read the record written about the humiliation that’s kept in Elios’ library, after all. Even I wouldn’t have known about it had Totona not specifically informed me of it.<br/>
「Yes, I need to save Nut. That’s why I came to you to acquire more information on the labyrinth, God Heibos.」<br/>
I bowed to him.<br/>
Nut was captured along with Reiji and the others. Those guys were trapped in the middle of Minon plains in the labyrinth. It was a given that Heibos, the creator of the labyrinth would know every detail about it.<br/>
「I understand. I’m indebted to that Nut fella too, after all. I’ll help you as much as I can.」<br/>
「Thank you very much, God Heibos」<br/>
I bowed to him.<br/>
「 But, Dark Knight, although it’s true that I created the labyrinth, Labyrs might have modified it afterwards. I have no way to know what kind of changes he made after he took over the labyrinth.」<br/>
Heibos spoke with a troubled face.<br/>
I guess the labyrinth right now is not the same as the original one. Fearing Modes, Labrys probably changed the entire place into his palace. Of course,  Heibos would have no idea about the changes Labrys made to the labyrinth.<br/>
「 The change shouldn’t be that drastic though. I’ll be fine as long as I know the basic structure of the place.」<br/>
「I see… In that case, take this blueprint of the labyrinth with you.」<br/>
「That’s more than enough. Thank you very much.」<br/>
I gratefully bowed to him once again. Heibos turned around and took a slate carved out of a gem from the cupboard behind him. It looked like the emerald tablet. Once again, I bowed as Heibos granted me that tablet.<br/>
「Your gratitude is enough. However, the most difficult part will come after you navigate through the labyrinth. Labyrs will be waiting in the deepest part of the labyrinth. He’s extremely powerful. Are you sure you can defeat him?」<br/>
