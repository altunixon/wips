Slave trader bro <br/>

 <br/>
Chapter 47 - Welcome <br/>
 <br/>
Slave trader: "My my, if it isn't Hero-sama. Welcome." <br/>
Naofumi: "I certainly was not expecting this." <br/>
 <br/>
We show up at the Slave trader's after the run-in with Motoyasu. <br/>
 <br/>
Slave trader:"What business do you have today?" <br/>
Naofumi: "Putting that aside......" <br/>
 <br/>
I am quite concerned with how the slave trader is dressed. <br/>
Even his subordinates...... They are all wearing luxurious accessories that are shaped like wings. <br/>
 <br/>
Naofumi: "That wing design looks good" <br/>
Slave trader: "Thanks to Hero-sama. Yup" <br/>
Naofumi: "Ha?" <br/>
Slave trader: "These profits were due to the Hero-sama peddling." <br/>
Naofumi: "What do you mean?" <br/>
 <br/>
I can think of several reasons, but none of them are too significant. <br/>
 <br/>
Slave trader: "First of all, is the infamous Philorial Queen. Many nobles with demon collections are trying to obtain one. Yup" <br/>
 <br/>
Ah, so the reason his reputation rose is because Firo was pulling the carriage. Well, she is certainly a rare demon. If someone wanted one, they would of course come to the slave trader and check. <br/>
And whenever a noble comes, he just points them to my direction. <br/>
While knowing that, I will not sell Firo because of her rampage. <br/>
 <br/>
Slave trader: "So when they give up, they purchase various other demons. Yup" <br/>
Naofumi: "That’s just like you" <br/>
 <br/>
At the moment, the condition to become a Philorial Queen is uncertain. <br/>
Otherwise there would be a lot more sold. <br/>
Will it become a queen if it's raised by a hero? <br/>
Two is not a good idea..... Firo alone is troublesome enough. <br/>
 <br/>
Slave trader: "Next, because Hero-sama's slaves are seen, there is a rumour that my shop's slaves are high quality, so I get some extra profits. Yup" <br/>
 <br/>
It's Raphtalia this time huh...... <br/>
Raphtalia is certainly a beauty with a great figure.  <br/>
Once people know where she came from, they would give them credit. <br/>
Will everything I do raise the slave trader's reputation? <br/>
 <br/>
Slave trader: "So, what do you need this time? Another slave? Maybe your co-operation on Philorial experiments?" <br/>
 <br/>
The slave trader rubs his hands together happily. <br/>
 <br/>
Naofumi: "No, I came for demon dealer business this time." <br/>
Slave trader: "Then Philorial experiments it is." <br/>
Naofumi: "That's not it" <br/>
 <br/>
Are there only 2 options in this guy's head? <br/>
 <br/>
Slave trader: "So, what do you need?" <br/>
Naofumi: "Ah, I was wondering whether or not I could purchase equipment for Firo here." <br/>
Slave trader: "Equipment?..... That can be done" <br/>
 <br/>
The slave trader turned to observe Firo. <br/>
The slave trader hummed cheerfully as Firo ran and hid behind my back. <br/>
As expected, she is bad with him. <br/>
 <br/>
Slave trader: "Would a horseshoe shaped weapon suffice? There is also armour made for Philorials......" <br/>
 <br/>
Armour is probably impossible, it is unreasonable to tailor-make something considering Firo's body size. <br/>
 <br/>
Naofumi: "Do you have anything for charging?" <br/>
Slave trader: "You could equip a helmet. To use when tackling" <br/>
Naofumi: "Hmm......" <br/>
 <br/>
The horseshoes might work since she is not a horse.  <br/>
 <br/>
Slave trader: "What about the claws?" <br/>
Firo: "Firo, what do you want?" <br/>
Firo: "Eh?" <br/>
 <br/>
Were you too scared of the slave trader to listen? <br/>
 <br/>
Naofumi: "You can get a helmet or have shoes attached to your feet." <br/>
Firo: "Umm..... When Firo transforms it will dig into my skin, No~" <br/>
 <br/>
Ah, is the threat from the dressmaker's still working? <br/>
It would be no problem in her demon form, but it would be very heavy for her in human form. <br/>
The horseshoe would dig into the foot too and the size of the armour might not be correct. <br/>
We head to the magic shop, it seems to be possible to add the string to metal plates, but it would be very expensive. <br/>
The defence would not increase that much either. <br/>
 <br/>
Slave trader: "How about de-attachable claws, yup." <br/>
Naofumi: "Firo, is that fine?" <br/>
Firo: "Yes" <br/>
Slave trader: "We need to measure the size so release her demon form please. Yup" <br/>
Naofumi: "Oh right" <br/>
Firo: "Okay~" <br/>
 <br/>
With a Bofun, Firo returns to her demon form and sticks her foot out. <br/>
A subordinate of the slave trader measure the size of Firo's foot. <br/>
 <br/>
Slave trader: "Hmm..... She is considerably larger than an average Philorial" <br/>
Naofumi: "Is there any you can prepare immediately?" <br/>
Slave trader: "I think we have one just barely her size. Are you all right with iron?" <br/>
 <br/>
I wonder what kind of offensive power I can expect. <br/>
Should I be looking for hardness? If it's sharp...... <br/>
 <br/>
Naofumi: "That's fine, I can afford to get this fellow something good." <br/>
Slave trader: "I understand. Iron with magical properties is the best I can prepare for now." <br/>
Naofumi: "By the way, how much is it?" <br/>
Slave trader: "Because of the help from Hero-sama, I will sell it to you for half the market price, which will be 5 gold coins." <br/>
Naofumi: "May I haggle further?" <br/>
Slave trader: "Hero-sama's greed is giving me the shivers. Fine, I'll compromise for 4 gold." <br/>
Naofumi: "Done. Also, throw in a good bridle." <br/>
Slave trader: "Sold!" <br/>
 <br/>
The slave trader's tension is high. Though he feels easy to deal with, I feel like I’m being used. <br/>
What scary business sense. This guy. <br/>
A big claw is brought out from the back of the tent. <br/>
The size of the metal claw seems to fit Firo's foot just right. That's good. <br/>
Naofumi: "This thing is huge" <br/>
Slave trader: "It's a claw meant for Wyverns. There is a bigger size too." <br/>
 <br/>
You're not even a Philorial anymore? <br/>
 <br/>
Firo: "Firo will wear this?" <br/>
Naofumi: "Yeah, it is your weapon." <br/>
 <br/>
Firo pick up the claw and equip it. <br/>
 <br/>
Firo: "It fits perfectly" <br/>
Naofumi: "Seems like it." <br/>
 <br/>
All that's left is to connect the claw to the foot with a cord. <br/>
Firo raises her foot to confirm if the claw is actually attached. <br/>
 <br/>
Firo: "Feels strange~" <br/>
Naofumi: "This will make your offensive power even stronger than before, you'll get used to it." <br/>
 <br/>
Firo's attack power with her leg is still ridiculous. Having it increase even more...... <br/>
The scene where Firo kicked Motoyasu is replayed in my mind. <br/>
This time, it seems Firo's kick will rip it apart. <br/>
 <br/>
Naofumi: "Firo, next time you kick that spear guy, do not use the claw." <br/>
Firo: "Why not~?" <br/>
Naofumi: "Because the balls will be completely crushed." <br/>
 <br/>
Though imperfect, he is a Hero. I do not know what consequences there will be if I murder him. I feel it's a little late now. <br/>
That guy's reason to live is to become popular with woman. <br/>
For Motoyasu being kicked in the groin by my subordinate would be very mortifying. <br/>
If that happened, who would be the one to inform that trash king? <br/>
 <br/>
Firo: "Hmm" <br/>
 <br/>
Firo concentrates really hard on the claw that we just bought. <br/>
Am I hearing properly? <br/>
Oh well...... Whatever happens to Motoyasu doesn't concern me. <br/>
I gave the slave trader 4 gold coins. <br/>
 <br/>
Firo: "Firo deosn't need the armour after all~" <br/>
 <br/>
Do the nails not fit? Firo seems to think that the armour is unnecessary. <br/>
Well, if you don't want it then that's fine. <br/>
 <br/>
Naofumi: "Now then, next......" <br/>
 <br/>
Hmm, I'm sure there was other business. <br/>
I can't remember after watching Motoyasu get blown off. <br/>
Certainly Raphtalia and Firo..... Ah I remember. <br/>
 <br/>
Naofumi: "Hey, slave trader. Is it possible for you to provide Class up here?" <br/>
Slave trader: "Class up you say?" <br/>
Naofumi: "Yeah, because the trash king won't let my subordinates who reached level 40 class up, I am having a little trouble. I remember seeing some slaves here above level 40." <br/>
 <br/>
I tell the slave trader my request and he puts his hand on his chin to think. <br/>
 <br/>
Slave trader: "Hero-sama, I regret to inform you that I cannot help with that. I do not have a letter of introduction." <br/>
Naofumi: "I see......" <br/>
 <br/>
Did this guy Class up from the power of a slave trader? <br/>
 <br/>
Slave trader: "If you obtain enough trust with neighbouring countries, you can use their Hourglass of the Dragon's era to perform Class Up." <br/>
Naofumi: "What?" <br/>
 <br/>
Wait a minute, this isn't the only country with a Hourglass of the Dragon's era? <br/>
 <br/>
Naofumi: "They are also in other countries?" <br/>
Slave trader: "Yes, though it might take you time to gain their trust......" <br/>
 <br/>
Time is very precious right now and I cannot waste it. <br/>
Will the Hero of the Shield have a bad reputation in the neighbouring countries? <br/>
This might be difficult. <br/>
 <br/>
Slave trader: "You can do it at the mercenary's country ZerutoBuru, the Demi-human country Silt Welt, and ShirudoFuriden is also available. Yup" <br/>
 <br/>
Naofumi: "There's that many?" <br/>
Slave trader: "Yes, for Hero-sama, I would recommend Silt Welt or ShirudoFuriden. You have a free pass there." <br/>
 <br/>
Naofumi: "Hmm...... How long would it take me to get there?" <br/>
Slave trader: "Let's see, by carriage it would be one month, and two weeks by boat." <br/>
 <br/>
The salve trader brought out a map and taught me the road. <br/>
Certainly, it is quite far from Melromarc. <br/>
It would take Firo a little over two weeks to arrive.  <br/>
Though, if we don't push it, 3 weeks would be the case. <br/>
Two weeks on a ship sounds good, but I would not be able to do anything during that. <br/>
 <br/>
Slave trader: "If there was a wyvern around here, Hero-sama would be able to get there very quickly." <br/>
Naofumi: "It is far......" <br/>
 <br/>
However, it would be important to Class Up because of our situation. <br/>
It shouldn't be that bad if I get new materials and monsters for my shield to absorb. <br/>
There is no meaning to stay here any longer as Raphtalia and Firo cannot improve. <br/>
Should we just go to the country of Demi-humans? <br/>
 <br/>
Naofumi: "I suppose we'll go when the wave is over." <br/>
 <br/>
Seriously, that trash king is devoting so much passion into annoying me. <br/>
 <br/>
Naofumi: "I am indebted to you." <br/>
Slave trader: "If that's what you think then by all means-" <br/>
Naofumi: "I refuse. Oh right. Do you sell humans here?" <br/>
 <br/>
I was wondering if it would be better to sell thieves here instead of killing them. <br/>
 <br/>
Slave trader: "Humans are impossible in this country. If you look deeper, there are people who will buy, but there is risk and quality to watch for." <br/>
 <br/>
Indeed, so Demi-humans are fine in this country. I guess this is a country of human supremacy. <br/>
 <br/>
Naofumi: "Well then, see you." <br/>
 <br/>
Thus, we left the slave trader's tent. Firo returns to her human form and ties her claws with a cord to carry.  <br/>
However, Raphtalia was quiet all the while during the conversation with the slave trader. <br/>
Well, it is admirable that she didn't intervene in a business talk and make it awkward. <br/>
 <br/>
Naofumi: "It's your turn, Raphtalia." <br/>
Raphtalia: "For?" <br/>
Naofumi: "Holy water. I'm sure it's sold at a church" <br/>
Raphtalia: "Ah, yeah" <br/>
Naofumi: "You’re a girl, Raphtalia, these black bruises would be bad." <br/>
Raphtalia: "Well..... If Naofumi-sama is worried." <br/>
 <br/>
Raphtalia mutters bashfully. <br/>
 <br/>
Naofumi: "No, I don't mind them. It's because I caused them." <br/>
Raphtalia: "So that's what you mean...... It's nothing" <br/>
 <br/>
I don't understand Raphtalia sometimes. <br/>
Well, either way it's decided.
<br/>
