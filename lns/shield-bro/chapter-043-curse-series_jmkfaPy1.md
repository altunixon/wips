That fucking cliffhanger. <br/>

Chapter 43 <br/>
 <br/>
The influence of the mountain has turned the land into nothing but barren rock. <br/>
We advanced slowly along a mountain path in the East of the country. <br/>
It's been 30 minutes since beginning to climb, while Firo is running and kicking a demon. <br/>
Right now, we have treatment medicine and antidotes due to the poisonous air. <br/>
By the way, we left the carriage at the village and only bringing a wagon before heading out. <br/>
 <br/>
Firo: "No~! Many of Firo's memories are in here~!" <br/>
 <br/>
Firo this fellow, she absolutely wants to pull everything, I'll ditch you here. <br/>
You were born last month and you're already talking about life? <br/>
Well, I can understand her attachment to the carriage because she has been pulling it for 90% of her life… <br/>
There are many demons here that are from the Poison class, such as Poison Tree and Poison Frog. <br/>
I diligently let my shield absorb it all after we defeated them. <br/>
 <br/>
Requirements for Poison Tree Shield have been revealed. <br/>
Requirements for Poison Frog Shield have been revealed. <br/>
Requirements for Poison Bee Shield have been revealed. <br/>
Requirements for Poison Fly Shield have been revealed. <br/>
 <br/>
All the Poison Resistance bonuses have been displaced, and have become status up as equipment bonuses. <br/>
The sole exception is the Poison Bee shield. <br/>
 <br/>
Bee Needle Shield Ⅱ <br/>
Unsealing completed... Equipment Bonus: Attack Power 1 <br/>
Special Effect: Shield of Stinger (Small) Bee Poison (Poison) <br/>
 <br/>
The defensive power hasn't really changed from the Bee Needle Shield, but the paralysis poison can now be changed to poison damage over time. <br/>
Well, enough of that, it seem the enemies are appearing quite frequently. <br/>
Even after defeating them, another one just takes its place. <br/>
Certainly, the wind is full of poison which scattered a plague, this is definitely too severe for a normal adventurer. <br/>
 <br/>
Naofumi: "There is no point to killing them all! Firo, run through!" <br/>
 <br/>
Raphtalia and I ride the wagon while giving instructions to Firo. <br/>
 <br/>
"Okay~!" <br/>
 <br/>
Firo pulled the wagon and ploughed through at full power. <br/>
Some experience was occasionally gained while running over enemies. <br/>
Along the way, Firo ran over a sludge-like demon, but because there was no time I didn't get to absorb it. <br/>
And after a few minutes… <br/>
 <br/>
Naofumi: "Is this our final destination?" <br/>
 <br/>
I saw the corpse of a dragon, leaking poisonous miasma and releasing a foul odour into the air. <br/>
The size is around a 10 meters and it resembles a Western-style dragon… <br/>
However, the features can't be made out any more. <br/>
The extent to which it is rotten has made it hard for even the original colour to be seen, all that's left is black miasma-like skin. <br/>
It seems the fatal injury would be a single blow to the abdomen. There is a big scar in the abdomen, exposing its internal organs and releasing a putrid smell. <br/>
Poison flies gathered around the rotten meat of the dragon. This is quite disgusting… <br/>
 <br/>
Firo: "I'm hungry~" <br/>
Naofumi: "Is your appetite so great you can still eat after looking at that…?" <br/>
 <br/>
Firo began eating the food in the wagon. <br/>
 <br/>
Naofumi: "Raphtalia, are you okay?" <br/>
Raphtalia: "Y-Yup." <br/>
 <br/>
I need to make sure Raphtalia is okay because her respiratory system is weak and the miasma will damage it even more. <br/>
 <br/>
Naofumi: "Take a rest as if it gets hard." <br/>
Raphtalia: "Okay" <br/>
 <br/>
I checked out the other side of the corpse while swatting poison flies. <br/>
The fingernails, scales, skin, and wings are all gone. Even the tongue was taken. Seem to have been stripped by Ren and the adventurers <br/>
It’s not an exaggeration to call all that is left bones and meat. <br/>
Excluding an extremely small portion of skin there is nothing left. <br/>
The smell is extremely nasty. This is definitely severe. <br/>
I might be faring better than Raphtalia because of my poison resistance. I have no idea about Firo. <br/>
 <br/>
Naofumi: "Raphtalia, exterminate the poison flies. Firo, come dismantle the corpse with me. It's too big for my shield to absorb." <br/>
 <br/>
I should let my shield absorb all of it. There is a risk of the soil getting corrupted as well if I bury it. <br/>
 <br/>
Firo: "Okay" <br/>
 <br/>
Firo finishes her meal with a bloated belly and nods. <br/>
 <br/>
Firo: "I feel a little sick." <br/>
Naofumi: "That's because you're over eating." <br/>
 <br/>
I approached the corpse to dismantle it as planned. <br/>
Goso...... <br/>
 <br/>
Naofumi: "…… Did it just breathe?" <br/>
Raphtalia: "Ummm……" <br/>
 <br/>
The dragon's corpse seems to have begun to move. <br/>
Oh my, it probably looked like it because of the poison flies flocking on the corpse. <br/>
Gorori...... <br/>
Yup. <br/>
Just my imagination. <br/>
The dragon's corpse began to move, and got on its hands and knees in attack mode. <br/>
 <br/>
Zombie Dragon: "GYAOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO!" <br/>
 <br/>
The dragon raised its head and unleashed a roar with its fang-less mouth. <br/>
 <br/>
Naofumi: "How the hell can it move!" <br/>
Raphtalia: "Naofumi-sama, please calm down!" <br/>
 <br/>
The corpse of the dragon…… No, the zombie dragon began to move as I shouted. <br/>
What the hell. This is too much for us. <br/>
The Level is unknown and any ability this zombie dragon has is unknown. <br/>
What is wrong with this world! <br/>
The zombie dragon turned to face us while regenerating each organ. <br/>
A part of the wing and tail is regenerated. I don't know whether the fangs and claws will regenerate too. <br/>
It seems to be liquidizing the rotting meat and turning it into its wings and tail. <br/>
The fatal wound on the abdomen was closing and the internal organs were regenerating. <br/>
Dealing with this is impossible for me! <br/>
 <br/>
Naofumi: "Let's escape!" <br/>
Raphtalia: "But, Firo is already--!" <br/>
 <br/>
Raphtalia pointed at the dragon zombie. <br/>
 <br/>
Firo: "Terya!!" <br/>
 <br/>
At that moment, Firo jumped on the zombie dragon and kicked it in the head. <br/>
There was a nice smack and the dragon zombie bends backwards. <br/>
 <br/>
Naofumi: "That's unexpected…… Can we fight it?" <br/>
 <br/>
Firo's offensive power is high and there are no fangs or claws on this zombie dragon. <br/>
We may be able to win, but the opponent does not have the concept of stamina…… <br/>
However, there is a risk of the zombie dragon coming for the village if we escape there. <br/>
Of course, there is also the possibility of it returning to its territory. But it might regenerate everything next time, so it must be defeated now. <br/>
 <br/>
Naofumi: "Don't be rash!" <br/>
Firo: "Okay!" <br/>
Naofumi: "Alright, we're stopping this thing here!" <br/>
Raphtalia: "Okay!" <br/>
 <br/>
The dragon roared threateningly and attacked. <br/>
I change into the Chimeric Viper Shield which has the highest defence, and I am able to block the dragon's attack. <br/>
But…… <br/>
 <br/>
Zombie Dragon: "GYAOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO!" <br/>
 <br/>
The zombie dragon shoots purple gas from its mouth at us. <br/>
Raphtalia and Firo run behind my back. <br/>
I set up my shield and prepare to block the attack. <br/>
 <br/>
Naofumi: "Ueh......What is this!" <br/>
Raphtalia: "Cough, Cough" <br/>
 <br/>
The real nature of the breath attack is high-concentrated poisonous gas. <br/>
Even with my poison resistance, I felt breathlessness and dizziness. <br/>
I had a coughing fit while Raphtalia behind me is barely able to breathe. <br/>
While the zombie dragon was shooting its breath, Firo who seemingly unaffected by the gas kicked it and made it stop. <br/>
 <br/>
Naofumi: "Ra-Raphtalia, are you all right!?" <br/>
Raphtalia: "Coughcoughcough-" <br/>
 <br/>
Raphtalia wanted to answer me with tears in her eyes, but she was just coughing non-stop. <br/>
……This might be really bad. <br/>
Firo and I can fight, but Raphtalia is out. <br/>
 <br/>
Naofumi: "Raphtalia, hurry up and get back, there is an antidote in the carriage. Drink it and rest." <br/>
Raphtalia: "Coughcough" <br/>
 <br/>
Raphtalia desperately points towards the zombie dragon. <br/>
I turned around and see what's happening. <br/>
In just a second, the zombie dragon opened its mouth and swallowed Firo who is jumping over it. <br/>
 <br/>
Naofumi: "A---" <br/>
 <br/>
Bagun! <br/>
A loud sound echoes, and from the zombie dragon's mouth crimson liquid drips down. <br/>
 <br/>
Naofumi: "FIROOOOOOOOOOOOOOO!" <br/>
 <br/>
My mind blanks out and I don't understand anything that Raphtalia is doing. <br/>
The bird who act like a pampered child ever since being born a month ago, always clinging to me, hugging me…… <br/>
Memories of Firo were recalled and shown like a revolving lantern. <br/>
 <br/>
What happened? <br/>
 <br/>
Something…… <br/>
 <br/>
The zombie dragon chewed its mouth several times,something red leaks out of it, and then the zombie dragon swallowed with a large gulp. <br/>
 <br/>
Raphtalia: "Cough!" <br/>
 <br/>
Raphtalia slapped my cheek strongly. <br/>
I have tears in my eyes. <br/>
The situation is only getting worse as I am lost in my own world. <br/>
However, all I felt was the anger from my heart after losing an important companion right before my eyes. <br/>
 <br/>
---Power, Do you desire it? <br/>
 <br/>
I thought I heard a voice from the shield. <br/>
I looked at my shield almost unconsciously and listened for the voice. <br/>
 <br/>
---Everything, Do you wish for it? <br/>
 <br/>
Dokun. <br/>
My heartbeat is stronger. <br/>
I remember the feeling that is produced from the darkness shield. <br/>
This… It's the same feeling after that fight with Motoyasu…… <br/>
The skill tree section of the shield appeared. <br/>
The skill tree screen turns inside out and a weird background that is neither black nor red appeared another skill tree. <br/>
 <br/>
Curse Series <br/>
This phrase reverberates in my mind. <br/>
The shield glows brightly. <br/>
 <br/>
Curse Series <br/>
Shield of Fury <br/>
Mortar Shield <br/>
Unsealing completed... Equipment Bonus: Skill "Change Shield (Attack)" "Iron Maiden" <br/>
Special Effect: Self-Burning Curse Physical Strength Improvement. <br/>
Being born from the heart, Killer Shield. <br/>
 <br/>
On this shield is a particular explanation…… Am I even conscious? I hold my hand over the shield with these feelings. <br/>
Shield of Fury <br/>
Intense feelings were released from the shield and the shield changes with a red and black light. <br/>
 <br/>
There was a crimson shield with decorations of abominations and flames. <br/>
Dokun......Dokun...... <br/>
Consciousness was swallowed in anger. <br/>
I hate everything in this world. <br/>
Everything in this world is black, all there is left are shadows sneering at me. <br/>
I am ruled by a single emotion. <br/>
 <br/>
Zombie Dragon: "GYAOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO" <br/>
 <br/>
A big black shadow stretched its arm towards me. <br/>
 <br/>
Naofumi: "UWAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAH"
<br/>
