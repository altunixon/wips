Act 1-2.2 : Childhood Friend and The Hero of Light<br/>
After his request, Runfeld glared at Kuroki.<br/>
 <br/>
「Moreover… He doesn’t seem capable of defeating that Hero.」<br/>
 <br/>
(You’re so damn right, bro.)<br/>
 <br/>
Kuroki unintentionally agreed with Runfeld.<br/>

<br/>
He didn’t expect that Runfeld would draw out his sword and slash at him in a challenge.<br/>
 <br/>
「Let me test your power! 」<br/>
「WOAH! WAIT A MINUTE! 」<br/>
 <br/>
Kuroki quickly sidestepped to dodge that attack. Unfortunately, Runfeld was relentless in his pursuit and charged again. The attack was avoided once more thanks to Kuroki’s brilliant footwork.<br/>
 <br/>
「HA! 」<br/>
 <br/>
And then, when Kuroki bent his knees slightly, his body moved as if sliding along the ground as he dodged every single one of Runfeld’s attacks.<br/>
 <br/>
(How is this possible? I’m… Moving faster than usual.)<br/>

<br/>
 <br/>
His body felt lighter than usual. Kuroki reached out and grabbed Runfeld’s wrist after dodging dozens of attacks. With one move, he disarmed Runfeld and flung him away.<br/>
Runfeld was too slow to react and ended up kissing the cold floor.<br/>
 <br/>
「GUHA! 」<br/>
「Ah, sorry! 」<br/>
 <br/>
The moment he realized what he had done to his opponent, Kuroki reflexively apologized. But that did nothing to dissuade Runfeld. He refused to give up.<br/>
Stretching his left arm, Runfeld aimed his palm at Kuroki and unleashed a flickering black flame.<br/>

<br/>
<br/>
「F^CK! 」<br/>
 <br/>
Modes noticed what he was doing and tried to stop Runfeld, only to be ignored. The black flame traveled toward Kuroki.<br/>
 <br/>
「Wait a minute, Runfeld-dono! THAT MAGIC IS…!」<br/>
「EAT MY BLACK FLAME!!!!! 」<br/>
 <br/>
As the black flame rushed towards Kuroki, it grew larger. If Kuroki wanted to dodge the flame, he’d have to run toward the crowd of monsters.<br/>
With how close the flame already was, he couldn’t dodge.<br/>
 <br/>
(Crap, I won’t be able to dodge this one!)<br/>
 <br/>
Kuroki stretched out his arms in a reflex to protect himself from the black flame as it collided with his body.<br/>

<br/>
<br/>
To everyone’s surprise, the flame stopped at Kuroki’s palm. More accurately…<br/>
 <br/>
… He caught the black flame with his bare hands.<br/>
 <br/>
(It’s… Not hot at all. How strange. How did I stop it?)<br/>
 <br/>
Kuroki gawked at the surreal scene before him.<br/>
Technically, since fire wasn’t solid it couldn’t be caught by hand. However, the black flame that was supposed to consume him was gently flickering on top of his palms.<br/>
When he clenched his fist, the flame vanished.<br/>
 <br/>
A bit away from him stood Runfeld, who couldn’t believe what he had just witnessed either. The back flame was his strongest attack and Kuroki stopped it like it was nothing.<br/>

<br/>
<br/>
「No way, my black flame was….」<br/>
 <br/>
Naturally, Kuroki had no idea the attack was so powerful. His bewilderment was solely for the ability to stop a flame.<br/>
 <br/>
(What a strange sensation.)<br/>
 <br/>
His palms weren’t scalded. No matter how much he checked, he couldn’t find the slightest trace of a burn on his hands.<br/>
He tried recalling the sensation he felt only moments ago and Kuroki was able to reproduce the same black flame from the palm of his hands.<br/>
「!?」<br/>
 <br/>
Kuroki was so surprised that he closed his fist and crushed his black flame in panic.<br/>
 <br/>
(What the?! How did I do that?! Can I truly create that flame?)<br/>
 <br/>
There was a brief moment of silence around the room. Then, from Kuroki’s side came the sound of someone enthusiastically clapping.<br/>
Modes approached him while laughing merrily.<br/>
 <br/>
「As expected of you, Kuroki-dono. Runfeld-dono is the strongest knight in Nargol and yet, he wasn’t even able to land a hit on you. On top of that, you even mastered the black flame. Let’s go with this flow and defeat the Hero.」<br/>
 <br/>
(What is this black flame, anyway? Is he talking about the black flame that I created just now?)<br/>
 <br/>
He suddenly recalled the image of Reiji and the others that Modes showed him. They had fired light and flame from their hands.<br/>
Kuroki wondered if he somehow had awakened a mysterious power after being summoned by the Demon King.<br/>
 <br/>
   (Urgh, my head can’t catch up with this rapid development. Am I really going to have to fight against Reiji?)<br/>
 <br/>
Modes nodded to himself.<br/>
He seemed satisfied that he had summoned Kuroki.<br/>
 <br/>
(He’s actually serious about me fighting Reiji! But why would I do that? Just refusing him on the spot seems so…)<br/>
 <br/>
「Uhm, Excuse m-…」<br/>
 <br/>
Kuroki was about to refuse Modes’s request when his brain silenced him and alerted him of something he had yet to consider.<br/>
Could he refuse? What would happen to him if he said he didn’t want to fight Reiji?<br/>
 <br/>
More importantly… If he refused, would Modes prevent him from going back to his world?<br/>
That was the most probable outcome, since fighting the Hero was the reason he had been summoned. Kuroki glanced at Modes and pondered about it for a while. In the end, he decided to test the waters.<br/>
 <br/>
「Uhm… Does that mean you won’t send me back to my world if I fail to defeat them? 」<br/>
「… EH? 」<br/>
 <br/>
Unexpectedly, Modes showed a surprised expression. It was the complete opposite of what Kuroki had been expecting.<br/>
 <br/>
「… The method to send Kuroki-dono back, you mean?」<br/>
 <br/>
Modes took out a crumpled piece of paper from his breast pocket and stared at it silently for a moment.<br/>
Kuroki suddenly felt an ominous premonition about the situation.<br/>
 <br/>
The Demon King opened his mouth and quietly read what was written on the paper. It appeared he was trying to reassure himself that he didn’t read it wrong.<br/>
The bad premonition that Kuroki felt made him risk asking Modes a question.<br/>
 <br/>
「Don’t tell me that you… don’t have a way to send me back? 」<br/>
 <br/>
Kuroki’s question created an awkward silence around the room. Even the Demon King was conspicuously silent.<br/>
He was right. It was the worst development.<br/>
 <br/>
「It seems that… There’s no way to send you back.」<br/>
「W-WAIT A MINUTE―――! What do you mean by that?! 」<br/>
 <br/>
Kuroki unintentionally raised his voice. The bitter truth that he was unable to go home was suddenly and forcefully shoved at him.<br/>
Modes bowed to Kuroki as he apologized.<br/>
 <br/>
「My apologies, but there’s really no way to send you back.」<br/>
 <br/>
Kuroki felt that contrary to his scary appearance, Modes was unexpectedly a timid person. Right then, he heard another person talking to him.<br/>
 <br/>
「Please wait a minute, Kuroki-dono.」<br/>
 <br/>
Mona, Modes’s wife, was already standing in front of her husband. She stared at Kuroki with such a pitiful expression that she looked like she could cry at any moment.<br/>
That kind of expression was a lethal weapon against Kuroki, who had no resistance to a woman’s wiles. He froze and remained silent.<br/>
 <br/>
「Please. Kuroki-sama. At least listen to Modes-sama’s story.」<br/>
 <br/>
Kuroki then looked at Modes.<br/>
 <br/>
「Well, Kuroki-dono. Let me tell you the reason why I ask you to protect me.」<br/>
