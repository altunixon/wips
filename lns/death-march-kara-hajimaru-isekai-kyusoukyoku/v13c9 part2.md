<br/>
<br/>
I talked about everything that has happened ever since I got to this world without hiding anything.<br/>
<br/>
This is a good opportunity, I'm also going to tell Arisa and Liza about my real name and the matter of god-slaying once I return to the mansion.<br/>
I'll decide what to do with the other girls after consulting with the two.<br/>
<br/>
"So you weren't summoned as a hero?"<br/>
"Yeah, according to the current hero there's a high possibility that I was summoned as a normal person by the reincarnated person from Rumooku Kingdom."<br/>
"Hm~m, Rumooku Kingdom huh. The pink-haired young king of that kingdom looks similar to Shiga-kun from Teni x Brave~"<br/>
<br/>
Teni x Brave is a puzzling shoujo manga about tennis battles between a blue-haired demon king and a pink-haired hero that Hikaru really got into when she was in Japan.<br/>
If I'm not mistaken, the main character was--<br/>
<br/>
"Hikaru. By any chance, did you get the name Shiga Yamato from the main characters of Teni x Brave?"<br/>
"Hehe~~, it was the name I always use in games, so it came out on the spur of the moment."<br/>
<br/>
I can't fault her since I also used the name I always use in games too, [Satou] that is.<br/>
After talking about my end of things, I listen to various stories of Hikaru after she was summoned as a hero.<br/>
<br/>
"I was bestowed divine power fragment by God Parion in a white room. I didn't want to kill so I chose the 『Friendship』 skill for befriending demon lords, and just that one filled the vessel of my soul fully."<br/>
<br/>
Certainly, there's a skill called [Friendship] on Hikaru's skill column.<br/>
I didn't think that it was a Unique Skill.<br/>
<br/>
"And then after the summoning, I was treated as a failed hero and got my holy sword and holy tools confiscated, and made to be in charge of transporting things with my infinite-capacity Inventory."<br/>
<br/>
Apparently, there were three other heroes besides Hikaru in Saga Empire at the time.<br/>
<br/>
"And then the airship that carried me was shot down by the demon lord's surprise attack, and I became a prisoner of Orc Empire--It's alright, don't worry! My chastity is still there for Ichirou-nii to take."<br/>
"I'm not worried about that."<br/>
<br/>
Of course I'm happy that Hikaru wasn't sexually assaulted.<br/>
<br/>
The demon lord that Hikaru talked about was the [Golden Wild Boar King] that I fought in the duchy capital's underground.<br/>
Hikaru who had become a prisoner made friends with the orcs thanks to [Friendship] Unique Skill, and built a camaraderie with the demon lord, but the demon lord who was encroached by the god's fragment challenged the two major empires at that time--Furu Empire and Saga Empire, causing a great war, turning the situation upside down.<br/>
<br/>
It was a dreadful war that had a large number of demon lords and multiple heroes fighting with each other.<br/>
All of those heroes besides Hikaru lost their lives in that battle, Furu Empire who boasted of being invincible fell into ruin, and the world was thrown in chaos, so Hikaru narrates.<br/>
<br/>
Afterwards, Hikaru was released from being a prisoner, and then she became friend with Tenryu, bestowed holy arms including Claiomh Solais at the Dragon God's place, and accomplished the great deed of vanquishing the great demon lord.<br/>
Hikaru herself seem to regret defeating the demon lord and the orcs, she doesn't seem proud about it.<br/>
<br/>
"Did you choose to remain here after subjugating the demon lord?"<br/>
"No way. I immediately chose to go home since I wanted to go to where Ichirou-nii was."<br/>
<br/>
--Then, why is she here now?<br/>
<br/>
"When I was returning to Japan, I got an oracle from our enshrined deity--I won't meet Ichirou-nii even if I get back to the former world, it said."<br/>
<br/>
Hikaru stops talking there and then stares at my eyes.<br/>
Hikaru's family from her father's side work as Shinto priests of a shrine, and the enshrined deity is--<br/>
<br/>
"Did you meet Ama-no-Mizuhana-Hime?"<br/>
"I didn't. Only the voice....no, that's not right, I got something like a lump of image before it become words."<br/>
<br/>
She believed that image, and then she returned to the current Duchy Capital.<br/>
After that, Hikaru founded Shiga Kingdom with her followers and comrades.<br/>
<br/>
The current capital of Shiga Kingdom was relocated after the second generation King took over, and she herself passed time by touring while reforming the world and excessively hunting youth restoration medicines in labyrinths.<br/>
And then she received another oracle, established a magical cold sleep facility in the tower at the sea of trees on the foot of Fujisan Mountains, and fell asleep there. It's just recently that she woke up it seems.<br/>
<br/>
The violet wig accidentally enters my view.<br/>
<br/>
--Right, I forgot to apologize to Hikaru.<br/>
I apologize for not clearing the misunderstanding of the king and the others about me being Yamato, and suggest one thing to her.<br/>
<br/>
"If you want to see your descendants, wear this wig, you'll be treated as the reincarnated Ancient King Yamato and can get to meet them y'see."<br/>
"Didn't I say that I protected my chastity! The second generation king is my adopted child you see. He was an illegitimate child of the last Furu emperor, a good child who pressed on even in difficult situations. His favorite phrase was 『To not shame the name of Shiga』--"<br/>
<br/>
Come to think of it, the king had Shiga as his family name huh.<br/>
<br/>
"--But, I see. It might be nice to meet the descendant of Sharlick-kun."<br/>
<br/>
Hikaru quietly said those words.<br/>
The same name as the third prince--wait, it's the opposite. The third prince probably got his name from the second generation king.<br/>
<br/>
I take out an unused violet wig and Nanashi set from Storage and give it to Hikaru.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
◇<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
After talking about our girls, I get back to the reason why I came here.<br/>
<br/>
"『Mock Body (Avatar)』?"<br/>
"Yeah, there was a record about it being used by a greater demon that was killed by Tenryu's breath."<br/>
"Then that's probably about the green greater demon. That one was like the different colored one among the rangers."<br/>
<TLN: Ranger as in Power Ranger. Sentai.><br/>
<br/>
According to Nanashi there were six senior greater demons with different colors that served under the Golden Wild Boar King, they were Red, Blue, Yellow, Green, and Black.<br/>
As for the greater demon itself, there are a lot of them that exist it seems.<br/>
<br/>
"How did you deal with it?"<br/>
"I figured its characteristic after encountering it many times. It used 『Zamasu』 as its ending word. I could quickly distinguish if it was a mock body if we just talked for a bit."<br/>
<br/>
.....Why didn't it just change the ending word.<br/>
<br/>
The Ropo from back then talked normally, so it was not the same person huh.<br/>
<br/>
"Then it's most likely a concealment type Unique Skill after all."<br/>
"Ichirou-nii's Unique Skill is enemy search type is it."<br/>
"Yeah, it's close to that. Once I marked someone, I know wherever they are even if they went to a different dimension."<br/>
"Hee, then does it know my current location?"<br/>
<br/>
What is she saying when she's right in front of me.... Hikaru's luminous point disappears from the Radar.<br/>
<br/>
Surprised, I open the map and check the marker column, Hikaru's marker denotes location unknown too.<br/>
<br/>
"How about it?"<br/>
<br/>
The moment Hikaru spoke, her marker reappeared on the Radar.<br/>
<br/>
"The marker still existed, but the location became unknown."<br/>
<br/>
Looks like she's satisfied with my answer, she nods proudly with crossed arms.<br/>
<br/>
"As I thought. Ichirou-nii's search skill gets its information from the same resource as the analysis board that I made."<br/>
"Analysis board, you mean Yamato Stone?"<br/>
"Looks like it's called that now.... Rather than that, it's about the resource."<br/>
<br/>
According to Hikaru's explanation, there's a stream of Magic Essence created by the Dragon God--the so-called Dragon Vein--and, the thing that's flowing in that stream is not just Magic Essence, but also various information.<br/>
The information from Appraisal and Market Price/Estimation skills also come from this Dragon Vein.<br/>
<br/>
"In other words, if you can stop the information from flowing into that Dragon Vein, you can isolate the information."<br/>
"....I see."<br/>
<br/>
Recognition Inhibition type items work by circulating false information to that stream.<br/>
I understand the principle, but then I can't catch Ropo like this--<br/>
<br/>
"However, it's difficult to maintain complete isolation you know. Your own magic power will be getting depleted terribly fast while you're isolating yourself from the flow of Magic Essence, and during that time, you can't even recover your magic power from outside~"<br/>
<br/>
Looking at Hikaru's MP gauge, it's been decreased by about 30%.<br/>
If it's decreased that much in just that short time, maintaining it in a long period of time should be difficult even if the user's level is relatively high.<br/>
I can understand why Ropo didn't do the stealing himself.<br/>
<br/>
I imitate Hikaru and try to isolate myself from the flow of Magic Essence.<br/>
<br/>
....It's not going well.<br/>
Is it different from cutting off my presence?<br/>
<br/>
Just like when I use hiding skills, I assimilate myself with the surrounding and furthermore, I project the opposite side of my body on the Magic Essence like optical camouflage--<br/>
<br/>
>[Recognition Inhibition] Skill Acquired<br/>
>[Magic Essence Concealment] Skill Acquired<br/>
>[Magic Essence Camouflage] Skill Acquired<br/>
>[Optical Camouflage] Skill Acquired<br/>
>TItle [One who Deludes All] Acquired<br/>
<br/>
I got something slightly different too, but well, since it looks useful, there's no particular problem.<br/>
Now that I'm able to do it myself, I now understand the way to sniff out the camouflage.<br/>
<br/>
"You're amazing Ichirou-nii. Is it a magic to make you disappear?"<br/>
"No, it seems to be an 『Optical Camouflage』 skill."<br/>
"It seems huh. You'd be a Jack all trades, Master of none if you waste your skill points you know?"<br/>
<br/>
I tell Hikaru who's worried, "It's alright", and start to try getting the crucial skill.<br/>
<br/>
I ask Hikaru to activate her camouflaging from Magic Essence skill.<br/>
<br/>
Just like before, Hikaru's luminous point disappears from the Radar.<br/>
In order to increase my concentration, I cut OFF the menu indicators.<br/>
<br/>
--Search for the oddness.<br/>
<br/>
If there's none of it, then search for the blank space.<br/>
<br/>
If there's no blank space, then search for the discrepancy.<br/>
<br/>
As if looking at the dead point of my view, I stare hard at the thing that can't be seen....<br/>
<br/>
....The fluctuation of information.<br/>
<br/>
....The unnaturalness of the flow.<br/>
<br/>
--I see it!<br/>
<br/>
>[Oddness Detection] Skill Acquired<br/>
>[Magic Essence Distribution Perception] Skill Acquired<br/>
>[Anti Magic Essence Camouflage Detection] Skill Acquired<br/>
>Title [One who Sees Through All] Acquired<br/>
<br/>
Alright!<br/>
Skills get.<br/>
<br/>
Unfortunately, it seems the skills can't link well with the Map, but I can use them to detect within the Radar's range.<br/>
<br/>
Now then, the preparation is complete.<br/>
I'll seize Ropo's tail when I get back to the Royal Capital!<br/>
