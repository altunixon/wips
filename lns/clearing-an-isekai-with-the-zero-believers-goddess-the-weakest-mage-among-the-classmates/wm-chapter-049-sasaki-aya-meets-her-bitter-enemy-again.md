<br/>
-From the Harpy’s Nest-<br/>
(There’s something outside.)<br/>
(What were the lookouts doing?)<br/>
Harpies may be monsters, but have high intelligence, and are good at acting in groups and in techniques to protect themselves.<br/>
The harpies that were at the entrance of the nest soon noticed the abnormality and looked outside…to be shocked.<br/>
A light that’s strong enough to think that morning had come, and the moment they noticed that it was a spell that was aiming to attack their nest, they were swallowed.<br/>
The nest crumbled tragically.<br/>
Burned by magic, their comrades were being crushed by the falling ceiling.<br/>
But there were some who managed to escape and fly away.<br/>
As long as they manage to escape into the air, there’s no one who can attack them!<br/>
((((EH?!))))<br/>
The flock of harpies that were flying in the air were suddenly swallowed by water.<br/>
Harpies are bad at swimming.<br/>
They don’t swim normally after all.<br/>
((((What is going on?!))))<br/>
They continued to fall without being able to make calm decisions.<br/>
And the harpies were slammed into the underground lake.<br/>
◇◇<br/>
 -Sasaki Aya POV-<br/>
"Sasaki-sama!" (Nina)<br/>
"Yeah, Takatsuki-kun and Lucy-san have succeeded!" (Aya)<br/>
We were hiding at the back of the waterfall, but the ceiling was crumbling with a thunderous sound, so we jumped outside.<br/>
The hated harpies were raining down together with the ruins of what was once the nest of the harpies.<br/>
Drowning in a massive amount of water.<br/>
"Lucy-sama’s [Multi-Elemental Magic: Shooting Star Meteors] and Takatsuki-sama’s [Superior Rank Magic: Water Dragon]; what a scary combo." (Nina)<br/>
"The underground lake has the Sea Serpent and the King Crocodile. They should definitely think of the harpies as food." (Aya)<br/>
"They are being attacked already." (Nina)<br/>
The splashing sounds of harpies trying to run away were being made, but it looks like the water monsters had the advantage.<br/>
"Take that!" "Hoi!" <br/>
At times, Nina-san and I would slam the harpies trying to escape back into the water.<br/>
The harpies were being dragged underwater among screams.<br/>
This is for my family! <br/>
Like I will let a single one of you escape!<br/>
"Haah…Haah…is there no one else?" (Nina)<br/>
"Next is to find where the Queen is…" (Aya)<br/>
I try to search for her, but I can’t find her.<br/>
Did she escape?<br/>
"Ooi, Sa-san, Nina-san." (Makoto)<br/>
After a while, Takatsuki-kun and Lucy-san floated down towards us.<br/>
In his hand there was a small umbrella-like item.<br/>
It is apparently called Fall Umbrella.<br/>
It is a magic tool that when opened, even if you were to fall from a high place, you fall down slowly.<br/>
Fujiwara-kun has some useful items.<br/>
"How is it? Was the Harpy Queen defeated?" (Makoto)<br/>
"Not yet. I don’t know if she was within the ones who fell." (Aya)<br/>
"Makoto, what about your Detection?" (Lucy)<br/>
"There’s so many that it is impossible to pinpoint." (Makoto)<br/>
Where is it?<br/>
Where is the boss of the enemy?<br/>
The noisy dungeon slowly went down in volume. <br/>
It looks like most of the harpies have been defeated.<br/>
"It was anti-climatic. Let’s celebrate once we get back." (Lucy)<br/>
"Oi, Lucy, saying that is a flag, you know?" (Makoto)<br/>
"Lucy-sama, you must not lower your guard." (Nina)<br/>
Lucy-san was already in victory mode, and Takatsuki-kun and Nina-san rebuke her.<br/>
I was also a bit drunk in the victory.<br/>
The harpies that I was unable to put a hand on no matter how much I tried, we managed to make short work of them! <br/>
At that moment, we heard singing.<br/>
A low singing that would be easy to miss.<br/>
What is this? It is kind of a pleasant song…<br/>
It doesn’t fit a dungeon.<br/>
"Hm? Don’t you hear something?" (Aya)<br/>
"What is it…? I certainly do hear something." (Nina)<br/>
"Me too…" (Lucy)<br/>
We look around.<br/>
"Here she comes." (Aya)<br/>
And then, she appeared.<br/>
We all turn at the same time.<br/>
Beautiful face and dazzling light brown wings.<br/>
The Harpy Queen was there.<br/>
The Harpy Queen was singing while speaking.<br/>
What a skillful monster.<br/>
"Could it be a siren song?!" (Nina)<br/>
Nina-san shouts flustered.<br/>
"Eh? Is she not the Harpy Queen?" (Lucy)<br/>
"She must have evolved and obtained the abilities of a siren! Her voice can charm men. Takatsuki-sama, you must not listen to her song!" (Nina)<br/>
Takatsuki-kun was looking at the Harpy Queen with a slightly surprised expression.<br/>
It doesn’t matter! <br/>
I will kill her because she gets us! <br/>
Thinking this, I tried to approach her, but…<br/>
"Is it okay for the male mage to die?" <br/>
The Harpy Queen grins.<br/>
"Male mage, put your dagger on your own neck!" <br/>
Takatsuki-kun followed those orders and brought the dagger to his own neck.<br/>
"Shoot!", Nina-san shouts.<br/>
"M-Makoto", Lucy-san was holding her staff with both hands and going ‘awawa’.<br/>
"Fufu, my voice works especially well with male humans. You were out of luck the moment you had a male companion." <br/>
"The singing of sirens can charm men. The human that attacked your family must have been controlled by her too." (Nina)<br/>
Nina-san says this in anguish.<br/>
So that’s how it was…<br/>
"I was wondering who it was. So it was the lamia girl that I thought I killed at that time… So you were alive." <br/>
She glared at me with hatred.<br/>
I also glare back at her with killing intent.<br/>
"Your whole family has died. Serves you right." (Aya)<br/>
"Harpies can come back as many times as we want as long as I -the Queen- am alive. Too bad for you." <br/>
She says this as if mocking me.<br/>
Damn it! That’s true.<br/>
Us lamias are already done for because Mother-sama was killed.<br/>
"You must not move. The human man there, slowly come to me. If your female companions attack me, cut your own throat." <br/>
Takatsuki-kun nodded lightly as if obeying her words.<br/>
"N-No way…", Lucy-san raises her voice.<br/>
"…", Nina-san was looking for a chance and couldn’t move.<br/>
(What should we do…?) (Aya)<br/>
With Takatsuki-kun as a hostage, we can’t move carelessly.<br/>
I look at the Harpy Queen and then at Takatsuki-kun, and then…<br/>
I noticed.<br/>
(Takatsuki-kun?) (Aya)<br/>
He is supposed to have been charmed by the Siren Song, and yet…he was looking intently at me.<br/>
His eyes were clear, and it doesn’t look like he is charmed at all.<br/>
(He is not being controlled?) (Aya)<br/>
Takatsuki-kun slowly approaches the Harpy Queen while looking here.<br/>
It was as if his eyes were trying to tell me something.<br/>
(Alright.) (Aya)<br/>
I gather strength into my right hand.<br/>
The so called [Action Game Player: Charged Attack] Skill that I did unconsciously before.<br/>
Of course, even if I were to attack right now, it wouldn’t work.<br/>
"The women, stay here. You are lucky. If my children were here, I would have turned you into their meal. I will be taking the male human." <br/>
I trust in Takatsuki-kun and continue gathering strength.<br/>
It is okay, I am sure.<br/>
"Human men are truly stupid. They apparently see me as a Goddess when they hear my voice. There’s some that even go down to their knees the moment we meet." <br/>
Her face as if she won is pissing me off.<br/>
"Here, want to lick my feet or something? It is the feet of a Goddess, you know." <br/>
Maybe she is letting it get to her head, the Harpy Queen pushes her feet out to Takatsuki-kun.<br/>
She is extremely annoying, but she does have enough beauty to charm men.<br/>
"M-Making Makoto lick your feet…I am jealou—how horrible!" (Lucy)<br/>
"Uhm, Lucy-sama?" (Nina)<br/>
Nina-san retorts.<br/>
Let’s question that statement of Lucy-san later.<br/>
Takatsuki-kun slowly bends to let his face get closer to the leg of the Harpy Queen, and…<br/>
"There’s no way these damn dirty feet are the feet of a Goddess." (Makoto)<br/>
"Eh?" <br/>
The ankle of the Harpy Queen was cut off!<br/>
"Gyaaaaaa!!" <br/>
The Harpy Queen raised a scream, and her eyes had things like icicles pierced in them.<br/>
Did he use magic at the same time he cut her with his dagger?<br/>
At what moment did he activate it?! <br/>
"Sa-san! Now!" (Makoto)<br/>
Takatsuki-kun shouts.<br/>
Right, this is my only chance.<br/>
I use Dash and close the distance in an instant.<br/>
So to not lose that momentum, I smashed my right fist that had been Charged into the enemy’s body.<br/>
"Gahah!" <br/>
A big hole opened at the stomach of the Harpy Queen.<br/>
My fist pierced her body.<br/>
"D-Damn it…you bastard!" <br/>
It is ridiculous, but it seems she is still alive.<br/>
The claws of the Harpy Queen try to cut me.<br/>
*Swish*<br/>
Takatsuki-kun’s dagger cuts off the head of the Harpy Queen.<br/>
Her head falls dully onto the ground.<br/>
Isn’t the sharpness of that dagger way too incredible? <br/>
"T-Thank you, Takatsuki-kun." (Aya)<br/>
"You have avenged them, Sa-san." (Makoto)<br/>
The tension that was straining inside me diffused, and I fell right onto Takatsuki-kun powerlessly.<br/>
(Ah, I am dirty from the blood.) (Aya)<br/>
Without worrying about me who was trying to separate from him, Takatsuki-kun caught me, and hugged me.<br/>
"Good work." (Makoto)<br/>
"…Yes." (Aya)<br/>
(I have avenged you, Mother-sama, older sisters, my siblings…) (Aya)<br/>
I place my head on Takatsuki-kun’s shoulder and close my eyes.<br/>
