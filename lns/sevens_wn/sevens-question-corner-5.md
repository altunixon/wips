TL: According to the Author, the Light Novel Lyle will go on a different adventure than the web one. Just to let you know. I’m not home for days, so I can’t pick up my copy yet.<br/>

Sevens Question Corner 5<br/>
Q: You won’t use "Mind" on the Circry House’s old man?<br/>
A: Third Generation Head ヽ(´ー｀)ノ: "There’s a restriction placed on its use. Well, this is also an important lesson, and I didn’t think he’d die on something of Hippogryph level, so I decided to wait and watch. Even if he did use it, I doubt it would prove anything, and for the current Lyle, he may make those he uses it on wary of him."<br/>
–<br/>
Q: Is Norma actually skilled? Or hopeless?<br/>
A: Fourth Generation Head (-@∀@): "… To put it bluntly, incompetent. If she had tried to make handing over commanding rights any more difficult, I would’ve made her a field casualty."<br/>
Third Generation Head (　・ω・): "But she did have something going for her. If she had a better environment to grow, I think she’d have become skilled. She’s sharp on how to survive, and she’s willing to change her point of view. Unfortunate, perhaps?"<br/>
Lyle (´・ω・｀): "By the way, she’s not joining the harem. I think Novem would oppose. And wait, even if it grows any further, I’m still going to be devoted to Novem."<br/>
Aria ( ゜д゜): "…"<br/>
Miranda ( ゜д゜): "…"<br/>
Clara ( ゜д゜): "…"<br/>
Shannon ( ゜д゜): "…"<br/>
Monica ( ゜д゜): "…"<br/>
Novem (・ω・｀ ): "Oh my… looks like a little… training is in order."<br/>
–<br/>
Q: About the education of second and third sons. The characters appearing in this work are just plain stupid. It’s simply obvious to educate them properly in the case something happens to the first son.<br/>
A: Fifth Generation Head (　゜д゜)、: "It’s natural for their parents to educate them? There’s quite a bit going on in a fantasy world, you know (Monotone). Huh? Could it be that everyone’s properly educated and you’re the one living in a fantasy?"<br/>
Sixth Generation Head Σ(´∀｀||;): "U-um… even in reality, those besides the heir are sent off to the church on occasion, and taken back in when the first son passes. Personally handling their education is up to the individual. Yeah!"<br/>
Seventh Generation Head (・ω・｀ ): "It takes alms and contributions and money. Education is the same. And wait, the knights incapable of heredity, and the far end knights are poor. If they were all decent, the expeditionary force would never have been sent out to reduce the mouths to feed. Because if a war is to happen, those sorts are going to find an abundance of work."<br/>
Fourth Generation Head (-@∀@) : "This is probably about Breid and Doris… Breid is basically a third child without heredity. A position where rather than the studies of a knight, he should have been thinking of how to live a civilian’s life. Everything besides reading, writing, and arithmetic were likely unnecessary. No, more so, a family that even taught him that must have treasured him quite a bit? Also, about Doris and sister… There are those that see girls as fine as long as they could birth children.  In the truest sense, she was Miranda’s spare."<br/>

Q: Is Lyle actually talented?<br/>
A: Seventh Generation Head ΣΣ(゜Д゜；): "He’s an able child! Lyle is a capable one I tell you! Because he’s competent, he can’t understand the feelings of those who aren’t, and he’s just lacking in socialization dammit! A pitiful boy!"<br/>
Lyle (´；ω；｀): "Grandfather, please stop… you’re making me sad…"<br/>
–<br/>
Q: The ancestors are strange. In the first place, if they made Lyle stand out, he’d be conspicuous to all the wrong eyes. They let him take on a request with little merits, riddled with demerits, and let him make a completely unnecessary expenditure.<br/>
The fact that you’re using the ancestors to forcefully move along the story without thinking of means and goals is becoming much too blatant.<br/>
A: Third Generation Head ( ゜∀゜): "Ah, yes, it truly is just as you say. He sure does stand out~  (Monotone). He starts standing out even if he doesn’t want to~ (Sparkle Sparkle)."<br/>
Fourth Generation Head (-@∀@): "No, I don’t think I really care if Lyle stands out or not. I think the Sixth and Seventh in particular still want him to flashily take back the territory, so perhaps they thought it best if he did? Also, everything’s an experience. Wouldn’t it have been fine if he failed? More so, I think that piling up this sort of experience is a cheap buy."<br/>
Sixth Generation Head (・∀・): "It’s best you don’t think that the best actions will always result in the best result. Failing when you can, and learning from it is just as important."<br/>
–<br/>
Q: Clark is too proficient. Why can’t he get a promotion?<br/>
A: Fifth Generation Head (´・∀・｀ ): "Well, there’s quite a bit, but I think it’s his disadvantageous personality. Individually, I think he’s wonderful, but in the world, assets and connections are a necessity for promotion. Rather than the knights being rotten, there’s too many people that getting a promotion is hell."<br/>
Seventh Generation Head (　´∀｀): "… If a war broke out, he’d get to the top in a flash."<br/>
–<br/>
Q: Marcus and Breid’s punishment.<br/>
A: Sixth Generation Head ( ｀・∀・´): "No change! Just get them promoted already. That way, you’ll raise hell on the damn imperial bastards. Flood them with incompetents!"<br/>
Third Generation Head  (´・ω・｀): "… Unlike Lyle, they had little opportunity to learn, so I do pity them a little. There’s no need to look after them all the way through, and if they don’t wish for it, there’s no meaning."<br/>
–<br/>
Q: Celes’ stay in the Imperial Capital.<br/>
A: Fifth Generation Head (・∀・): "The Walt House occasionally drops by the capital, but Celes is not currently taking an extended stay there. I’m not sure about the future, though."<br/>
–<br/>
Q: About the yellow gem<br/>
A: Lyle(゜д゜): "No comment."<br/>
–<br/>
Q: That Growth joke is something of a one-shot gag. I’d like it if you stopped.<br/>
A: Third Generation Head (　 ゜∀゜): "Well too bad! That’s the setting the world’s built upon, and mr. lyle will continue to appear! No matter who hates it, mr. lyle will come!"<br/>
