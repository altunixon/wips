Chapter 134: Balloon Shield<br/>
"Naofumi-sama"<br/>
As I am testing out my new shields, Rafatalia comes running over.<br/>
She was gone for quite a while. Did she finish gathering her fellow villagers?<br/>
"I went to many different stores with the Slave Dealer, and managed to gather quite a few people." (Rafatalia)<br/>
"I see… Okay, I’ll go check it out. Do you think I have enough funds?" (Naofumi)<br/>
"Yes, I was sent over to ask what you wanted to do with the remaining money." (Rafatalia)<br/>
"I see. I’ll head over to the Slave Dealer’s place then." (Naofumi)<br/>
"Yes, let us go. Where are Firo and Rishia?" (Rafatalia)<br/>
"I sent them out to hunt. I think they will be out for a while." (Naofumi)<br/>
I don’t know how far Firo went.<br/>
I don’t think she will go to a place where even she will have trouble.<br/>
Her feral instincts are quite sharp.<br/>
"Ah, but first I have to say something to the Queen." (Naofumi)<br/>
It will probably be best to prepare to depart tonight.<br/>
Time is of the essence. I need to see just how much I can train these people.<br/>
"Hmm? Have you finished preparing?" (Queen)<br/>
The Queen appears behind me. It seems she went out for a walk.<br/>
I fed most of the materials to the Shield, so the mountain has pretty much disappeared.<br/>
… The Queen must be pretty busy right now. It’s not strange for her to look for a change of pace.<br/>
"For the most part. Please send the rest of the materials to my village. I plan to make the meat into a meal sometime in the near future." (Naofumi)<br/>
With the new slaves I will be getting, the need for food has risen exponentially.<br/>
It’s not that I can’t procure food on my own, but there’s a lot I need to do right now. First I need to work on reestablishing the village.<br/>
"Then I shall dispatch a platoon of soldiers to assist in your work. Please use them as you will." (Queen)<br/>
"Ah, thanks. I plan to head to the area now to prepare." (Naofumi)<br/>
"If you need anything, please feel free to ask. We will do our best to meet your needs." (Queen)<br/>
"I got it. The first things I’ll need to do is to collect construction materials and put up theft countermeasures. I plan to depart tonight, so please prepare the men by then."(Naofumi)<br/>
If a hero were to load a carriage with a large load of slaves it would seem quite shady. That’s why leaving in the night is probably best.<br/>
I thought Firo’s eyes would be like those of a bird, but she can see at night just fine. Travelling at night is no problem.<br/>
"I understand." (Queen)<br/>
After hearing the Queen’s response, I thank her and leave the castle. I head for the Slave Trader’s tent.<br/>
"Hero of the Shield, I have gathered the slaves at your request." (Slave Dealer)<br/>
"Yeah, I heard from Rafatalia." (Naofumi)<br/>
When I enter the tent, I see some Demi-Human children, 8 in total, staring at me from inside cages.<br/>
All of them are watching my every action with fear.<br/>
Some of them are even shaking.<br/>
"I thought there would be adults here as well…" (Naofumi)<br/>
"In the wave, most of the adults perished… We don’t know the fate of those that survived…" (Rafatalia)<br/>
Even if they survived, Rafatalia was unable to discover their locations. Or perhaps she found that they had died afterwards…<br/>
If they had fled during the First Wave, there is a possibility that they escaped to Silt Welt or something like that.<br/>
Finding them will probably be impossible.<br/>
Anyways, I don’t plan to dig very deep into this.<br/>
"Now then, I’m sure you have already heard it from Rafatalia, but I will declare it again here." (Naofumi)<br/>
It’s probably best for me to act strict here.<br/>
At the start, Rafatalia was a coward and Firo grew to be selfish.<br/>
To avoid these problems down the road, I should treat them with discipline.<br/>
"From now on, you all are my slaves. You will travel to your former village and rebuild it, while training to get stronger." (Naofumi)<br/>
If I show kindness here, I will be looked down upon.<br/>
"I hate lazy people the most. If anyone begins to slack off, I will sell them without hesitation. You got that!?" (Naofumi)<br/>
As I say this, I see the Slave Merchant issuing commands to his subordinates. One strikes an instrument reminiscent of a gong.<br/>
… Who told him to do that?<br/>
Look at them, they look afraid.<br/>
… No that’s probably my fault.<br/>
"Hiiiiiii-!" (Child)<br/>
"R-Rafatalia-chan, is this really the guy!?" (Child)<br/>
"Mama-!" (Child)<br/>
My ears hurt.<br/>
But what I’m running isn’t a charity. I must raise a force to combat the wave.<br/>
"Now then, I will start the Slave Contract." (Naofumi)<br/>
As I raise my hand, the Slave Dealer lets out a smile. He hands over some Slave Contract Ink.<br/>
I put a drop of my blood into the ink.<br/>
And the process of putting the slave crest on the children started.<br/>
"Yes, what do you plan to do with the rest of the money?" (Slave Dealer)<br/>
"I plan to continue peddling, so if you have a monster I can use for transportation, it will help." (Naofumi)<br/>
… The Slave Dealer’s eyes are still sparkling. Please stop it with that look.<br/>
"Then, shall I contribute a Filo Rial to your cause?" (Slave Dealer)<br/>
"No, I have my hands full with a Filo Rial as it is. Please offer a different species." (Naofumi)<br/>
"Are you not good with Filo Rials?" (Slave Dealer)<br/>
"I would prefer a monster that won’t lose to Firo in skill. One that may be able to help plow the fields." (Naofumi)<br/>
While wandering town, I didn’t see only Filo Rials and Horses. I’ve also seen animals that looked like Cows and Caterpillars hooked up to carts.<br/>
And if I raise another Filo Rial… My hands are full with Firo.<br/>
"Master, I’m Hungry" (Naofumi’s imagination)<br/>
The thought of more of those things is enough to make my face pale. I only want to raise them one at a time.<br/>
Among magic beasts, Filo Rials need to be raised with quite a bit of discipline apparently.<br/>
They might add a good amount to our fighting power, but for now, we are still just reconstructing. I don’t think I can raise a Monster with an appetite of that level.<br/>
I still have a lot of Spirit Turtle meat, but I don’t plan to waste it all at once.<br/>
I should first start with something I can actually handle.<br/>
"I see… Then I shall find a beast for you." (Slave Dealer)<br/>
"I’ll leave it to you" (Naofumi)<br/>
"Do you want to purchase one from an egg? Or would you rather have a fully grown one? Raising them from eggs makes them more compliant later on in life." (Slave Dealer)<br/>
"I guess an egg is fine for now." (NAofumi)<br/>
"Understood. Yes." (Slave Dealer)<br/>
The Slave Dealer walks towards the part of the tent used for Monster Sales.<br/>
I look through the restrictions I can put on the eight new slaves.<br/>
It seems I can also put a punishment for revealing classified information.<br/>
I’ll decide on their specific tasks later.<br/>
Is seems that the slave registration process has ended. As I look outside, I see the sun has already set.<br/>
We can leave after Firo and Rishia arrive.<br/>
After a while, Firo comes running in.<br/>
… There is no one on her back.<br/>
Did she fall off?<br/>
Firo skids to a halt in front of me.<br/>
"I’m home~!" (Firo)<br/>
"What happened to Rishia?" (Naofumi)<br/>
"?" (Firo)<br/>
"P-please let me down…urp…" (Rishia)<br/>
It seems that Rishia hasn’t fallen off. She is grasping onto some of Firo’s feathers on her rear as if her life depended on it.<br/>
It seems that she almost fell off when Firo was going at a high speed.<br/>
Firo sits down, and Rishia falls off of her quite abruptly.<br/>
"Urp…" (Rishia)<br/>
Rishia is making sounds quite unbefitting of a noble.<br/>
-Please hold for technical difficulties. (TL: Yes, it really says that)<br/>
"Now then, to check the results." (Naofumi)<br/>
These two have been out since just before noon. The sun has already set, so…<br/>
Ah, Rishia’s level has risen by 20. The results aren’t bad.<br/>
Her stats are even higher than they were before the Reset. It seems that the Growth Correction effect is working properly.<br/>
"I can see stars. Itsuki-sama… Is that you in the afterlife?" (Rishia)<br/>
"That’s an illusion. Firo, please snap her back to reality." (Naofumi)<br/>
"Got it" (Firo)<br/>
Firo lightly slaps Rishia’s cheek.<br/>
Is what it looked like, but Rishia is sent flying. Is she all right?<br/>
"Wha!!! Where am I!?" (Rishia)<br/>
"Oh, so you were okay." (Naofumi)<br/>
"I thought I was dead!" (Rishia)<br/>
"Yeah, but you gained 20 levels to show for the experience. Your stats are higher than ever before, aren’t they?" (Naofumi)<br/>
"He?" (Rishia)<br/>
Rishia checks her own status.<br/>
"Wow, Amazing!" (Rishia)<br/>
For her to be this amazed at her own stats…<br/>
Now then.<br/>
"Rishia, I have a job I want to give you." (Naofumi)<br/>
"W-what is it?" (Rishia)<br/>
"I want you, Rafatalia and Firo to help me manage the new Slaves and monsters I have acquired" (Naofumi)<br/>
"I-I see…" (Rishia)<br/>
"Rafatalia and Firo are already strong, I want you to act like their elder and train with them." (Naofumi)<br/>
There’s no point in just leveling up.<br/>
Rishia, who leveled up down a wrong path before is a good example of this.<br/>
I plan to have Rafatalia and Firo assist them, but I don’t just want to build a party with a high level.<br/>
Gaining combat experience is also important in itself.<br/>
So for a while, I’ll take Rafatalia and Firo off the front lines.<br/>
This way, these people will be able to gain a strength that can’t be measured in level.<br/>
"You’re going to get stronger, right? Good luck." (Naofumi)<br/>
"B-but that was for Itsuki-sama, and he…" (Rishia)<br/>
"He’s not the type of person to die so easily is he? When you meet up again, don’t you want to make him tell you that he needs your power?" (Naofumi)<br/>
I think it’s fine if he is dead, but I’m saying this in order to further Rishia’s growth.<br/>
"I got it! I’ll do my best!" (Rishia)<br/>
Rishia seems to have gained motivation. She stands up.<br/>
Good. Her heart has become stronger than before.<br/>
All that she needs now is diligence. Probably.<br/>
"I’ll wait expectantly." (Naofumi)<br/>
"Yes!" (Rishia)<br/>
"Master, what do you want Firo to do next?" (Firo)<br/>
"Please get the carriage. We’ll be carrying a lot, so also bring some carts. There should be a lot in front of the warehouse." (Naofumi)<br/>
"Yes! Ah, I found this for you." (Firo)<br/>
And with that, Firo begins to pull out the corpses of various monsters.<br/>
I’ve seen all of these before. Whatever, I’ll just feed them to the shield anyways.<br/>
–<br/>
You’ve unlocked the Balloon Shield<br/>
You’ve unlocked the Red Balloon Shield<br/>
You’ve unlocked the Orange Balloon Shield<br/>
You’ve unlocked the Yellow Balloon Shield<br/>
–<br/>
What?<br/>
The monster I absorbed was a normal balloon. And I unlocked all of the other Balloon Shields with it.<br/>
For arguments sake, I look through the new shields. All of them only effect stats.<br/>
But the Balloon Shield is the only one with a strange skill.<br/>
–<br/>
Balloon Shield 0/5 C<br/>
Ability Bonus<br/>
…<br/>
Equipment Bonus<br/>
Monster Book<br/>
–<br/>
Its stats are terrible. Even worse than my initial Small Shield.<br/>
But what does it mean by Monster Book?<br/>
I test it.<br/>
With a beep, a window appears in my field of vision.<br/>
… It displays all of the monsters I have fed the shield up until now.<br/>
It even says where I found them. It also seems to have the ability to lead me to a specific species of monster if I wish to encounter it.<br/>
How convenient.<br/>
It records the data of any monster I absorb.<br/>
However, it doesn’t seem to display the number of monster species of this world.<br/>
In high spirits, Firo went and got the carriage I had parked at the castle.<br/>
To be honest, if it weren’t for Firo, the voyage would probably take a few days.<br/>
"Hero of the Shield, as you have requested, I have prepared you some eggs. Yes." (Slave Dealer)<br/>
The Slave dealer appears carrying a number of eggs.<br/>
"Ah, I’m grateful." (Naofumi)<br/>
"Do you know when your next visit will be?" (Slave Dealer)<br/>
"Well, I still have money left over, so I may come again soon to buy more slaves." (Naofumi)<br/>
"Well then, I will wait expectantly for that time. If I find one of the slaves you were looking for, should I contact you?" (Slave Dealer)<br/>
"Yes, please do." (Naofumi)<br/>
"Understood." (Slave dealer)<br/>
"Then I guess I should be off." (Naofumi)<br/>
I hear the sound of Firo pulling the carriage getting closer.<br/>
"…but before that…" (Naofumi)<br/>
I turn around and face the Slave Dealer, who is rubbing his hands together.<br/>
"I’ll make dinner." (Naofumi)<br/>
I use the Spirit Turtle meat that Firo brought back with her, and begin cooking in the tent.<br/>
It’s a basic hot pot consisting of meat and soup.<br/>
The turtle has a bit of a unique taste, but it shouldn’t be a problem.<br/>
"Wha?! This is Delish!" (Child)<br/>
"What is this? It’s better than what mom used to make!" (Child)<br/>
"Yeah! Why is that?" (Child)<br/>
"Naofumi-sama is a very skilled chef, you know." (Rafatalia)<br/>
"Yeah! Firo loves to eat master’s cooking." (Firo)<br/>
The slaves seem to be getting closer over the delicious meal.<br/>
"This is just perfect. To eat a meal personally cooked by a hero. I might fall for you." (Slave Dealer)<br/>
The Slave Dealer also managed to obtain some of the food in the heat of the moment… If I worry about it, I lose. I’m cooking in his store, anyways.<br/>
"If you find more of the villagers, you might get to eat it again. Work hard." (Naofumi)<br/>
But the Slave Merchant seems lost in his meal. I’m not sure if he heard me.<br/>
It’s like a welcoming party. Things will get busy from here on out. I need to make sure they get proper nourishment or they won’t hold up.<br/>
And like that, after the meal the slaves boarded the carriage and we leave the castle town in the darkness of the night. Towards our new home.<br/>
