<br/>
"Makoto-kun, be careful, okay?" <br/>
The only one seeing me off was the old lady that was our elementary class teacher.<br/>
"With your magic, you can only defeat one small monster." <br/>
She tells me with a worried expression.<br/>
The result of my 1 year of training is that my class is still Mage Apprentice.<br/>
Not only did I not get my goal that was magic swordsman, I didn’t even get to become a decent mage.<br/>
"It is okay. If anything happens, I will run away with my thief skills." (Makoto)<br/>
"That’s right, you must not fight." <br/>
A mage apprentice travelling alone is rare. <br/>
Apparently because they are normally killed by monsters immediately.<br/>
They told me fervently that I should join a party somewhere, but I refused.<br/>
Conversation with strangers is tiring, and they will definitely make fun of me.<br/>
That’s why, I am okay alone.<br/>
"I could actually get you a job here in this temple though." <br/>
I was also told this many times.<br/>
"If I do that, my 9 years of lifespan will come in the blink of an eye. I have to get Contributions for the Gods." (Makoto)<br/>
"It is a rough world." <br/>
"Well then, I will be going." (Makoto)<br/>
She is a nice teacher.<br/>
I was a bad student, but she watched over me till the very end without abandoning me. <br/>
A while after leaving, I look back at the temple for a bit. The teacher is still watching.<br/>
I waved widely at her and, after that, I didn’t turn back again.<br/>
I will be alone from now on.<br/>
I will do my best.<br/>
◇◇<br/>
It was a peaceful journey for a while.<br/>
The chirping of birds every now and then that could be heard from the forest was relaxing.<br/>
The brook that flows at the side of the mainroad is coming out from the lake of the Spirit Forest that extends at the back of the Water Temple.<br/>
The water contains the protection of the Spirits.<br/>
Thanks to that, it has the effect of making it hard for monsters to come near the stream.<br/>
That’s why it is relatively safe to be close to the stream, and there’s roads and settlements made because of it.<br/>
This includes the city closest to the Water Temple, Makkaren.<br/>
That is my first destination.<br/>
My friend Fuji-yan should be there.<br/>
I wonder if he is doing well.<br/>
I walk leisurely while feeling nostalgic.<br/>
I have Detection and Stealth activated all the time even when walking.<br/>
It is in order to not meet monsters and not get noticed by them as much as possible.<br/>
I can detect around a radius of 100 meters.<br/>
By the way, the Sage, Kawamoto-san, can detect in a radius of 5 kilometers. 50 times more.<br/>
Ain’t fair, right?<br/>
At the very least, my Detection can find monsters hiding in the forest that runs along the mainroad.<br/>
I was enjoying the view in the beginning because this is my first journey, but with the neverending sight of the forest, the mainroad, and the brook, I am already bored of the sight.<br/>
"Might as well train." (Makoto)<br/>
Let’s do the water proficiency training that I was doing everyday at the temple.<br/>
Clear my mind, and raise my mana.<br/>
"[Water Ball], [Water Ball], [Water Ball], [Water Ball], [Water Ball], [Water Ball], [Water Ball]." (Makoto)<br/>
I create 7 water balls from the stream.<br/>
Volleyball sized.<br/>
Normally, with my low mana, I wouldn’t be able to make 7 water balls.<br/>
But if it is controlling nearby water, there’s almost no need for mana.<br/>
There’s only the need for magic proficiency. <br/>
It is apparently because you can control it by using the mana in the environment. <br/>
The more you train with your magic, the better your proficiency gets.<br/>
By the way, it seems the strength of the skills also changes with the proficiency.<br/>
By increasing the proficiency, you get better at the generation speed and the control of the magic.<br/>
There’s no losses in raising the proficiency as much as possible.<br/>
I have trained in this 1 year wholeheartedly without slacking.<br/>
The teacher gave me her seal of approval by saying that if it is only in water proficiency, it is more than High Grade.<br/>
It is just that the power is at elementary level.<br/>
"That’s fatal though… Hm?" (Makoto)<br/>
There’s a reaction from my Detection.<br/>
It is a bit disconnected from the mainroad, inside the forest.<br/>
"A person and monsters…?" (Makoto)<br/>
Looks like monsters are attacking a person.<br/>
I maintain stealth and silently get closer.<br/>
The wagon is surrounded by a group of goblins.<br/>
Four goblins are surrounding a merchant-looking man that is fighting back with his sword.<br/>
He is outnumbered.<br/>
Hm, should I save him?<br/>
If it were a game, I would go save him without hesitation.<br/>
Goblin battles are almost certain win events.<br/>
"If I were a hero, that is…" (Makoto)<br/>
Sadly to say, this is a survival isekai.<br/>
You won’t respawn once you die. There’s no such feature in this parallel world.<br/>
It is not like you come back with half of your money taken away.<br/>
Death is final. <br/>
And I am a mage apprentice that can’t even defeat one monster.<br/>
"This is rough… The teacher told me to run away." (Makoto)<br/>
But…the person in front of me is being attacked by monsters.<br/>
If I abandon him, it will haunt me in my sleep.<br/>
But what’s the point if I end up dying.<br/>
What should I do…<br/>
At that time, a game window suddenly appeared in front of me.<br/>
Don’t save him ←<br/>
Save him<br/>
"Oh?" (Makoto) <br/>
What’s this? <br/>
This is a first.<br/>
The effect of RPG Player?<br/>
Oi oi, what’s with this skill?<br/>
I scratch my cheek.<br/>
You are being quite stylish in your production.<br/>
Choosing ‘Don’t save him’ here would disqualify me as a man.<br/>
"Can’t be helped. Let’s do this." (Makoto)<br/>
I chose ‘Save him’.<br/>
I approach the goblins and raise my mana.<br/>
I fix my aim so I don’t hit the merchant. <br/>
[Water Magic: Ice Arrow]!<br/>
I turn the water balls I was using for training until now into ice arrows, and shoot them towards the goblins.<br/>
They all hit.<br/>
But…<br/>
…As expected, I couldn’t defeat them.<br/>
The goblins are bleeding heavily, but it didn’t incapacitate them.<br/>
It was far. <br/>
But it should have damaged them somewhat.<br/>
"Oi, are you okay?" (Makoto)<br/>
I speak to the merchant-looking man that was being attacked.<br/>
"P-Please save me!" <br/>
"Got it." (Makoto)<br/>
I normally maintain [Clear Mind] at 50%, but I set it at the highest that is 99%.<br/>
With this skill, the tension and fear dim.<br/>
I can concentrate solely on defeating the enemy.<br/>
The closest goblin begins to approach me.<br/>
Only one of the four is one size bigger.<br/>
Must be the leader of the goblins.<br/>
The remaining three are still surrounding the merchant.<br/>
The Goblin Leader is holding a rusted pitch black dagger.<br/>
I don’t want to fight him in close combat.<br/>
I raise my mana till the goblin leader is at a distance where the weapon might or might not reach.<br/>
[Water Magic: Ice Needle]!<br/>
"Gya!" <br/>
The ice magic I shot blinds the goblin.<br/>
An ice needle the size of a nail was shot into the eyeballs of the enemy.<br/>
It is a shabby spell, but it is effective against living beings that rely on their eyes.<br/>
I was wary about whether it would begin waving its weapon around wildly, but it let go of its dagger and was covering its eyes. <br/>
Okay!<br/>
Without letting this chance escape, I take the dagger the goblin leader let go of.<br/>
I stab that dagger into the chest of the goblin, and…<br/>
[Water Magic: Cooling]<br/>
Elementary water magic that cools and freezes liquids.<br/>
Passing that through the dagger, I attack the blood of the opponent.<br/>
The body of the goblin twitches, and it collapses with a thud.<br/>
The killing move I did my best to think of with the low mana I have.<br/>
In the middle of a fight, I am always keeping the 360° view of the RPG Player skill.<br/>
The other three goblins were looking over here.<br/>
It has been going as planned until now.<br/>
But I am currently completely empty of mana.<br/>
I seriously lack mana…<br/>
2 of the 3 remaining goblins approach me.<br/>
I will lead them to the stream just like this.<br/>
I cannot fight without water.<br/>
I adjust my distance between the goblins while moving back.<br/>
There’s still one goblin close to the merchant, but he should be okay if it is just that much.<br/>
The 2 goblins charge at me.<br/>
[Evade] <br/>
I activate the thief skill.<br/>
Without opening too much distance, I lead them to the stream.<br/>
Okay okay, if it is here, I can use as much water as I want.<br/>
The 2 goblins are getting really close.<br/>
[Water Magic: Surface Walk]<br/>
I gently…stand on the water surface.<br/>
This is the effect of the spell.<br/>
But the depth of the water is around the waist of an adult.<br/>
The goblins entered the stream and were trying to attack me.<br/>
Got them!<br/>
[Water Magic: Water Current]<br/>
I use water magic to wrap the water around the goblins.<br/>
The body and face of the goblins get surrounded by the water. <br/>
They grab their neck and go ‘glup glup’ as they showed signs of pain.<br/>
They shouldn’t be able to breathe.<br/>
Drown just like that.<br/>
After 5 minutes, the goblins die.<br/>
"Fuuh, somehow managed." (Makoto)<br/>
I hurriedly returned to the merchant.<br/>
◇◇<br/>
The merchant was panicking.<br/>
A group of goblins that got aggressive because of their hunger suddenly attacked me.<br/>
If it were only one goblin, I have the confidence that I could have managed.<br/>
But they were slowly surrounding me to not let me escape.<br/>
They are waiting for me to lose my stamina.<br/>
The horse is scared and won’t be of use.<br/>
"Guh!" <br/>
A pain runs in my right leg.<br/>
The goblin leader had gotten my attention, and the moment I moved my gaze, the goblin at the back threw a rock.<br/>
But the aim and speed were abnormal.<br/>
It had the projectile skill?! <br/>
A unique monster?!<br/>
I have heard that there’s times when a monster can be rarely born with a skill.<br/>
I couldn’t continue standing from the pain on my leg, and ended up on one knee.<br/>
"Gya." "Gya." "Gya." "Gya." <br/>
The goblins surrounding me seemed like they were laughing at me.<br/>
This is bad.<br/>
Even though they got the leg of their prey, they are not attacking at once.<br/>
They are patiently waiting for their prey to weaken.<br/>
At the corner of my mind, the fear that I may be dying today was slowly rising.<br/>
My throat was drying, and my hands that are holding my sword are damp.<br/>
"Gya." "Gya." "Gya." <br/>
Without loosening the encirclement, the annoying shouts were stirring my concentration.<br/>
This is bad, what should I do?<br/>
The moment I thought this is as far as I can go, ice arrows pierced the goblins.<br/>
"Eh?" <br/>
What happened?<br/>
"Ooi." <br/>
A human? An adventurer?!<br/>
"P-Please save me!" <br/>
I desperately plead for help.<br/>
The one who appeared was a boy.<br/>
His attire is light, and he isn’t holding any weapons.<br/>
Will he be okay?<br/>
Honestly speaking, he looks weak.<br/>
I don’t even know if he can even defeat one goblin.<br/>
But he came to help me without abandoning me even though I am surrounded by goblins. <br/>
No matter how weak of an adventurer he is, we have to join forces.<br/>
I held my sword tightly and, at the moment I tried to somehow stand up with my paining leg…<br/>
"Gya!" <br/>
The goblin leader suddenly covered his eyes and began to groan in pain.<br/>
"Eh?" <br/>
Did the boy do something? <br/>
But there was no chant, and no signs of him using a magic tool.<br/>
With flowing movements, the boy closed the distance to the goblin, and stabbed him with the dagger.<br/>
That light stab won’t defeat the monster!<br/>
But I was wrong.<br/>
The goblin twitched, his body bending heavily, and then collapsed just like that.<br/>
W-What was that technique?<br/>
The goblins surrounding me must have seen the human that appeared as a threat, they attacked the adventurer.<br/>
The boy was moving as if pulling the goblins to the stream.<br/>
The most problematic goblin that has the projectile skill ran away after seeing the leader defeated.<br/>
I could hear the ‘swoosh swoosh’ sound of rampaging water and the screams of goblins.<br/>
Is he okay?<br/>
I was worried, but because of the pain in my leg, I couldn’t move. <br/>
After a while, the boy returned.<br/>
Not a single wound.<br/>
He is an unbelievably skilled fighter.<br/>
I shouldn’t judge by appearance.<br/>
"Are you okay?" <br/>
"Y-Yes, you saved me." <br/>
He really did. <br/>
Being released from such extreme tension, I fall to the ground and lose all strength.<br/>
◇◇<br/>
"Thank you very much! You are my savior!" <br/>
The young merchant I saved was thanking me an incredible lot.<br/>
"This may not be much, but as thanks." <br/>
"Uhm, 100,000G? Isn’t it too much?" (Makoto)<br/>
I don’t know much about what’s the regular though.<br/>
"I want you to come along with me on the way." <br/>
"I see, as an escort." (Makoto)<br/>
I say ‘if that’s the case…’ and accept it.<br/>
This path is normally rare for monsters to appear in the first place.<br/>
There should be no problem.<br/>
On the way, the newbie merchant was telling me stories of his pains. <br/>
Now that I think about it, Fuji-yan should be a newbie merchant too.<br/>
He must be having it rough.<br/>
"It is about time we prepare the camp." <br/>
The merchant suggests before it gets dark.<br/>
There’s spaces to make a camp here and there at the road we are going through.<br/>
The feudal lord is apparently managing this in order so that adventurers and merchants can rest.<br/>
"I apologize for the simple meal." <br/>
After saying this, the merchant takes out a stew that is frozen with magic.<br/>
In other words, frozen food.<br/>
Heating it on the fire, and after it is steaming hot, eat it together with hard bread. Having dinner like this while outdoors is delicious.<br/>
"Well then, I will go around and keep an eye on the surroundings." (Makoto)<br/>
I place the sleeping bag I borrowed on the ground, and tell him this.<br/>
"Sorry about that. If I didn’t have an injured leg, I would have gone with you." <br/>
"I am your escort here, so just leave it to me." (Makoto)<br/>
Saying this, I leave the wagon.<br/>
It seems like the merchant is going to sleep in the wagon. <br/>
Getting slightly away from the camp space, I confirm whether there are any monsters by using [Detection].<br/>
And then, I turned off [Clear Mind] which I always have on.<br/>
"Haaah…" (Makoto)<br/>
I let out a big sigh.<br/>
My hands were completely wet in sweat, and my heart began to beat faster.<br/>
To think I would encounter monsters before even reaching the first city.<br/>
I look at the Soul Book and see that my Contribution increased.<br/>
My lifespan increased slightly?<br/>
Around 3 days.<br/>
"What a relief… I somehow did it." (Makoto)<br/>
My legs were trembling.<br/>
"I planned on having weaker monsters as my first kill." (Makoto)<br/>
Like horned rabbits or giant rats. <br/>
A group of goblins as my first opponents was unexpected.<br/>
"But I won." (Makoto)<br/>
A smile appears in my face and I look up at the starry sky with a tightened fist.<br/>
"I did it." (Makoto)<br/>
I pump my fist slightly.<br/>
The Water Temple staff got disappointed at my weak skills, I got pitied by my classmates, got consoled by a small boy, and even my amiable teacher was worried about me till the end.<br/>
Telling me that I won’t be able to survive in this world.<br/>
"It will be okay, it will be okay." (Makoto)<br/>
I can do it.<br/>
[Clear Mind], [RPG Player], and [Water Magic: Elementary].<br/>
With these 3 skills, I will survive this world.<br/>
Like hell I will die in 9 years.<br/>
"Now that I think about it, the weapon that the goblin carried, what should I do with it?" (Makoto)<br/>
The rusted and tattered dagger the goblin had.<br/>
It doesn’t seem like it will be worth much.<br/>
It would be slightly pathetic to use as a weapon.<br/>
"Let’s save it as commemoration for my first victory. I might be able to use it somehow by clearing out the rust." (Makoto)<br/>
I decided to wrap it around a piece of cloth and carry it with me.<br/>
Let’s go back and sleep.<br/>
My first day after leaving the temple has finished.<br/>
I couldn’t sleep for a while from all the excitement.<br/>
◇◇<br/>
When I came to, I was in a vast space of nothing.<br/>
A dream?<br/>
That’s weird. I wasn’t planning on sleeping so deeply that I would end up dreaming though.<br/>
Where’s this place? <br/>
I feel like I have seen a scene like this in one of my games.<br/>
While I was thinking that, my back felt a chill.<br/>
I felt the presence of something out of this world.<br/>
When I look back, I see it.<br/>
"Hello there, Makoto. I have been wanting to meet you." <br/>
The one standing there was an unbelievable beauty that no one would be able to forget once you see her once.<br/>
"W-Who are you?" (Makoto)<br/>
My voice was trembling.<br/>
That’s just how unearthly that beauty of hers was.<br/>
That girl smiles.<br/>
"A Goddess." <br/>
