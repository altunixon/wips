Vandalieu – Dhampir (Dark Elf), 9 years old, male<br/>
The protagonist who is becoming less and less human. Before he could become an adventurer and an honorary nobleman, he will be crowned emperor soon (Preparations are currently underway), and for some reason, he has acquired the ‘Demon King’ Title. He is currently thinking about how life doesn’t always go as planned as he eats Bugitas’s meat.<br/>
Now that he has defeated Bugitas, restored peace to the southern region of the continent and will become emperor, he has a feeling that he’ll be spending some time going around the nations of the southern region of the continent, diligently managing internal affairs…<br/>
But since they are all nations that already had a considerable amount of infrastructure to begin with, it might not be as much trouble as when he first restored Talosheim. At least, in his opinion.<br/>
By acquiring more fragments of the Demon King, he has become a living mass of even more different materials. Blood Potions with improved effects and specially-made brushes assault the citizens of Talosheim! Will they be able to resist the charms of these items?!<br/>
By acquiring the Corpse Demon Commander Job, he has become able to equip Undead that don’t need to eat or drink, making him a walking fort in a slightly different way from Knochen. He is able to utilize a ‘suddenly, Undead!’ method of attack.<br/>
With the Demon King User Job, he has become able to use the Demon King’s fragments even better. A notable benefit is that he can activate the fragments now without having to say, “Activate.”<br/>
And the second Guider Job, Dark Guider. So far, he thinks that this Job is fine, as he does not seem to have guided anyone around him into committing suicide.<br/>
By speaking with the gods of the southern region of the continent, he was able to learn various things and set his sights on his heartfelt desire to resurrect his mother Darcia.<br/>
To achieve this, he must challenge the high-difficulty Dungeon created by the evil god of labyrinths that nobody has successfully cleared. But because he possesses the Labyrinth Creation Skill, he believes that it will be possible if he has everyone assist him and prepares properly.<br/>
If possible, he intends to recover the remains of Martina, a spirit user Elf who was a companion of the ‘Blue-flamed Sword’ Heinz. If he feels the same hatred that he felt towards Gordan and Riley when he actually sees the remains, he intends to not turn them into an Undead. However, there is the precedent of having used the remains of Mikhail’s companions to create Rapiéçage, so he thinks that he will end up turning Martina into an Undead.<br/>
He feels responsible for having a half-baked attitude and being negligent with the Sauron Liberation Front’s defenses, which caused them to be unable to defend themselves against an attack from the Fifteen Evil-breaking Swords. As the Amid Empire came to threaten him under the pretense of a negotiation, he feels even more hostility towards them now and made an informal declaration of war. He did this by kidnapping Duke Marme and leaving behind Rickert’s bisected head at the scene of the crime.<br/>
But it seems that he does not view the entire Amid Empire and everyone living in it as an enemy, so he currently has no plans to conduct indiscriminate attacks through disease and poison.<br/>
He had already become enough of a threat that there are no problems with his individual strength, but now that he has developed Dark King Magic spells, his power is equivalent to an S-class adventurer’s on his own.<br/>
If he doesn’t use his special Skills or the Demon King’s fragments, he is somewhere between B-class and A-class level.<br/>
Budarion – Noble Orc Abyss High King, 15 years old, male<br/>
The low-key protagonist of the seventh volume. Immediately after his father’s death, his younger brother yielded to an evil god’s temptations and began a rebellion that drove Budarion from the throne. After that, Budarion defeated his brother with the prophesized Holy Son who appeared later, a battle that culminated in a battle to the death against a descended evil god… there is no mistake about this.<br/>
As he is a Noble Orc, he was quite shocking to Vandalieu and his companions, as the only Noble Orcs they had known were Bugogan and his sons who appeared in the first volume, and the Noble Orcs who spawned in Dungeons.<br/>
A blonde bowl-cut that produces a halo when light shines upon it; gentle, intellectual eyes; a well-featured pig’s snout; round cheek lines; manly fangs. A peerlessly handsome individual among Noble Orcs.<br/>
He was born when his father was already quite old, so from a young age, he was made to diligently study how to become a good emperor (by the standards inside the Boundary Mountain Range), as well as training in magic and combat. Fortunately, he was blessed with the abundant talent necessary to absorb all of this without being overwhelmed, but because of this, the time he spent with his brother Bugitas became less. He regrets that he was too late to sense the change in his brother.<br/>
After being defeated by Bugitas once, Budarion escaped the Noble Orc empire. Due to Vandalieu and Legion’s (Isis’s) surgery, he regained the eye and arm that he lost.<br/>
And by being guided to the Demon Path and defeating the generals that served as Bugitas’s subordinates, he increased his Rank and became a Noble Orc Abyss King.<br/>
He took back his nation after that, but as his nation could not stand above the nations that it had caused trouble for or realistically fulfill the role expected of it, he declared that it would return from being an empire to an ordinary kingdom.<br/>
He has known his fiancé, Princess Kurnelia, since he was born, and she is his first love. He intends to marry her within the next few years.<br/>
There are also currently talks of a marriage between him and Princess Lulu of the High Kobold nation. He is indeed a King.<br/>
Incidentally, strictly speaking, the next generation’s rulers are not technically determined by bloodline in the nations inside the Boundary Mountain Range, but by the candidates’ own abilities and whether they are acknowledged by the gods who protect their nations. But in some nations, this is merely an official stance. This was especially true in the Noble Orc empire.<br/>
By awakening superior Skills such as Demon Path Fang Swordsmanship, Monstrous Strength and Spirit Clone Descent, Budarion’s combat abilities have improved rapidly. His strength is somewhere between that of the ‘Light-speed Sword’ Rickert and the ‘Five-headed Snake’ Ervine.<br/>
If an Adventurers’ Guild were to send out a request for his extermination, they would request an S-class adventurer by name or dispatch multiple A-class adventurer parties.<br/>

Gizania – Arachne Samurai Master (Large-build), 35 years old, female<br/>
A large-build member of the Arachne race, possessing the bottom body half of a spider. She is a beauty with a short haircut, but her upper body is large as well, giving her a height of about two and a half meters including her lower body, and she possesses sturdy muscles so beautiful that Vandalieu enjoys having her strike poses for him.<br/>
According to Vandalieu, she possesses beautiful white skin and gemstone-like compound eyes.<br/>
She has the appearance of a dignified female warrior, but her personality has some serious and naïve aspects to it, and she is something of a sis-con as well. She respects all of her older sisters equally, but she is particularly close to Kurnelia. She believes that Budarion is a respectable man, one worthy of marrying her sister.<br/>
Her dream is to become a legendary Bushi, a Job mentioned in the records left by the champion Hillwillow that is said to require the acquisition of a hundred Skills to obtain, and then challenge the Trial of Zakkart, a warrior’s greatest honor.<br/>
She acted as bait in order to allow Kurnelia to escape, was heavily wounded and then was saved by Vandalieu. At the time, she thought that Vandalieu was a little girl and gave him a Necklace of Deep Affection, an act equivalent to a marriage proposal.<br/>
But not wanting to undo this action upon learning that Vandalieu was a member of the opposite gender, she decided to continue serving him.<br/>
In fact, Gizania has devoted her life to combat, and she has feelings for Vandalieu, who saved her from danger and healed her wounds. There is a large age difference between them, but it seems that the astounding first impression he left on her has caused her to not mind how young his appearance is.<br/>
Also, because of his partially mature actions and bizarre behavior, she takes almost no notice of the age difference.<br/>
Of course, even if something causes her to suddenly become aware of the age difference, they are both members of races with long lifespans, so it can be assumed that she will not consider the age difference to be significant. In fact, her sister Kurnelia’s age is more than triple that of her fiancé Budarion.<br/>
The hair on the lower half of her body looks fluffy but is actually very hard. But due to Vandalieu’s insistent brushing, it is becoming softer.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
(adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({});<br/>
<br/>
As another person with eight legs, the Scylla Privel sees her as a particular rival, but Gizania simply considers her as another friend.<br/>
Through the fierce battles she went through, she has increased her Rank and changed her Job. She went from being a Rank 6 Arachne Samurai Adept to a Rank 7 Arachne Samurai Master, and her Job has changed to Samurai Master as well.<br/>
When she first appeared in the story, her abilities were similar to those of a C-class adventurer, but now, she is equivalent to a B-class adventurer. But because she gained Experience Points so suddenly, her Skill levels haven’t caught up with her Job, so she still needs more training.<br/>
Incidentally, Surpass Limits: Magic Katana is something like a variation of the Surpass Limits: Magic Sword Skill.<br/>

<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
Myuze – Empusa Shadow Kunoichi, 70 years old, female<br/>
A member of the Empusa race, a race created by Vida that possesses the sickles and wings of a praying mantis. She was serving as the captain of a team that guarded one of Zanalpadna’s gates. She is an old acquaintance of Gizania’s; she is something like a neighborhood onee-san to her.<br/>
She is young but possesses considerable skill. She has a bright, friendly personality and is loved by those around her.<br/>
However, she does not have the coolness commonly portrayed in ninjas.<br/>
She has a strong yearning to become a ninja, so she considers herself fortunate to have met Vandalieu, who possesses knowledge regarding ninjas. She anticipates that she will become able to master the way of the ninja if she continues to follow him. Incidentally, the definition of the way of the ninja in her mind is to ‘kind of be an amazing ninja,’ a very vague, ambiguous definition.<br/>
She is the niece of the previous queen, but both she and those around her don’t think anything of this other than that she had an amazing aunt. In Zanalpadna, the queen serves as more of a priestess than a ruler, so the next ruler is not decided by bloodline alone.<br/>
She is highly capable; she would be able to defeat a B-class adventurer if they fought one on one, face to face. But as a scout, her Lockpicking and Trap Skills are of low Level, and she does not have the Intuition Skill, so that is quite disappointing.<br/>
This is because doors, treasure chests and traps protected by high-difficulty locks do not spawn very often in Zanalpadna’s Dungeon. And other than conducting some reconnaissance, she has not performed many scout-like tasks, as her job is to guard the gate.<br/>

Eleanora – Abyssal Vampire Marquis – 12 years old (20 years old at time of Vampire transformation, 32 years old in total)<br/>
A female Vampire who is flustered by the fact that her rival (Isla) has rapidly increased her presence. With flames of jealousy burning towards Isla, who has acquired a Title that shows that she is Vandalieu’s hound and received a collar from him. Through a lot of blood, sweat and tears, including much training in Dungeons, she became a Rank 10 Vampire Countess.<br/>
… Other than the Vampire True Ancestor and Pure-breed Vampires, she is likely the only Vampire in history who has increased their Rank to this extent within just over ten years of becoming a Vampire.<br/>
Through experiencing the battle against Ravovifard’s incomplete incarnation in Bugitas’s body, her Rank increased even further.<br/>
As she was not mistaken for Vandalieu’s mother during recent events, she has a favorable impression of the nations inside the Boundary Mountain Range.<br/>
In terms of fighting strength, she is capable enough to fight against an A-class adventurer, but in order to defeat opponents like Rickert without any danger to herself, she needs to awaken superior Skills.<br/>
If she fought Rickert in single combat head-on with her sword, taking into account that her weapon would be poorly matched against his, she would have about a 60% chance of winning. If she were to build a strategy centered around her time-attribute magic, that chance would increase to about 90%.<br/>

Vigaro – Ghoul Arch-Tyrant, 172 years old, male<br/>
A successful individual who will likely gain more wives due to his deed of defeating Bugitas’s subordinate, General Budirud, who invaded the Ghoul nation in the Boundary Mountain Range. Because he defeated all of the Ghoul nation’s men including the king in contests of strength, his popularity is second only to Vandalieu’s.<br/>
But Vigaro himself says that he already has too much on his plate and doesn’t want any more for now. However, he did say ‘for now,’ so he likely will have more wives in another decade or so.<br/>
You’ll have more and more half-siblings! Isn’t that great, Basdia!<br/>
He is called Aniki by the Ghoul nation’s king (Vandalieu is called Great-Aniki), and has been granted the divine protection of Zozogante, the evil god of the dark forest, the guardian of the Ghoul nation.<br/>
Borkus – Zombie Folklore Hero, male<br/>
He is always terrible at impersonating a Zombie. His power has reached levels that very few Zombies have attained in the course of history; he is a man who tried to tear an evil god apart, limb from limb.<br/>
As a result, he has been acknowledged as a hero even in the nations south of the marshlands and is greatly bewildered by the flood of marriage proposals that he is receiving. He wonders, why would marriage proposals be made to an Undead? Isn’t Vigaro in charge of that?<br/>
When he asked Vandalieu to do something about it, Vandalieu ended up telling him that he would try to do something so that Undead can create children as well.<br/>
He has grandchildren and thinks that he was plenty old enough even before becoming an Undead, but once he remembered Talosheim First Princess Levia and his party member, the Second Princess Zandia, he realized that even without his own circumstances, Vandalieu would have done that kind of research sooner or later.<br/>
Borkus accepts that this is how things are now, but he has refused all marriage proposals as it is uncertain as to whether this research will be successful.<br/>
Vandalieu has misinterpreted this, thinking that Borkus is trying to rush him.<br/>
Upon learning that her father received marriage proposals, Borkus’s daughter Gopher thinks that if there really are such whimsical Ojou-sans, then perhaps having new families would make her adventurer father settle down a little.<br/>
Incidentally, at the point of the story at the end of the seventh volume, Borkus is guarding the former Scylla territory, where the Sauron Liberation Front’s base lies. There are rumors that he reaps lives with each swing of his sword and that his bellows can be heard from the temporary fort at the foot of the mountains, causing the soldiers there to tremble in fear.<br/>

Kurt Legston – Human, 29 years old, male<br/>
The third son of the Legston family of earls from the Mirg shield-nation, who has fled to Talosheim. He is a plain individual who is not as gifted in combat as the eldest son, nor as exceptional in the role of a military official as the second son (Chezare), his only special characteristic being his ability to work steadily… or at least, that is what he is supposed to be, but for some reason, he was dispatched as a diplomat in these recent events. This is the fault of his older brother, who is doing work suitable for a prime minister despite being a general.<br/>
He has seen with his own eyes nations being managed not only by Vida’s races, but monsters such as High Goblins and High Kobolds as well. His own stereotypical views, which he had thought were already thoroughly broken after seeing Talosheim, were shattered even further.<br/>
This is because although legends did say that there was a Noble Orc empire “somewhere out there,” no humans had ever imagined that the empire would be a well-managed nation that was not at all inferior to human societies.<br/>
Like Borkus, Kurt has also received marriage proposals, but even though he is the third son, he is still a nobleman, and as such has dealt with them flawlessly. But as he is already quite old and far from home, he is currently consulting Chezare as to whether he should settle down.<br/>
Several noblemen from the occupying army in the Sauron region capable of working as civil officials, including Cuoco, have deserted and fled to Talosheim. He thought that his workload would decrease because of this, but his new subordinates were all strong-willed (though not as much as Cuoco), so he is struggling to bring them together.<br/>
A paid vacation policy will soon be implemented, so he is working hard and enduring until then.<br/>
A long time ago, he was on the side that hated the resistance, but that hatred was mainly due to his occupation and mostly directed towards the Reborn Sauron Duchy Army led by the now-deceased Raymond; he does not have any particular feelings towards Iris and her companions.<br/>
Legion – Great Legion, 0 years old, gender = ?<br/>
The mysterious flesh-sphere creature that continues to increase in size as their Rank increases. They play an important role with their Teleportation and ability to conduct surgery, and they have acquired the ‘Holy Flesh-wife’ Title.<br/>
They have never directly crossed swords with anyone in a war, but they are feared because of their appearance. But conversely, they are loved in places where they have performed medical care.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
(adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({});<br/>
<br/>
They received the ‘Holy Flesh-wife’ Title as a result, but Isis thinks that this is good, as she feels like it has made it easier for her to perform medical care.<br/>
By leveling in Dungeons during their spare time, they became a Rank 7 High Legion. After that, they become a Rank 8 Great Legion through their battle against the ‘Light-speed Sword’ Rickert.<br/>
Nothing has changed about them except for their size since their Rank increased, but since their size can be controlled freely by the Size Alteration Skill, even this change is not apparent.<br/>
They have also gained a Unique Skill called Encroachment Fusion, but how to use it is currently unclear. As a result of discussion, they can imagine what it might be for from its title, but it seems that they have decided not to test the Skill carelessly.<br/>
Their efforts have gone in an extraordinary direction, such as repeatedly receiving flame and lightning treatment and then recovering the damage caused by them repeatedly in order to acquire the Fire and Lightning Resistance Skill to overcome their weakness. But they consider this to be ordinary.<br/>
Incidentally, despite possessing the Throwing Skill, Pluto still has no control in her throws. This is because the objects they throw are irregularly-shaped masses of flesh that meet heavy air resistance, and because of her unstable posture when protruding from the mass of flesh that makes up Legion’s body. It seems that the Skill’s bonuses have their limits.<br/>
They were able to defeat Rickert, who would have been A-class if he were an adventurer, but they have analyzed their victory and acknowledged that it was because Rickert was badly matched against them and Ereshkigal’s Counter determined the outcome of the battle. But in truth, if Rickert had devoted all of his efforts to escaping, it is possible that Legion would not have been able to stop him from reaching the fort at the foot of the mountains and the villages and towns beyond it. Though Rickert didn’t notice it, Legion is capable of floating through the air, but not moving at high speeds.<br/>
Legion can roll across the ground at high speeds, but if Rickert avoided them and took shelter in a town or village, Legion would have chosen to back off. Although it wouldn’t matter if soldiers and knights got involved, Legion believes that innocent civilians should not get involved.<br/>
Legion is now reflecting on the battle and trying to improve their strength and learn how to fight without relying on their abilities. Using Size Alteration without separating to act with the form of a single person is a part of that.<br/>
Iris Bearheart – Obscene-Majin Succubus, 19 years old, female<br/>
She was the leader of the Sauron Liberation Front, the resistance organization active in the Sauron region that is occupied by the Amid Empire. She has kept her face hidden behind a mask and gone by the name of ‘Liberating Princess Knight’ so that the resistance could continue even if she were to be killed by the enemy, but now that she has become a Succubus, she has officially become a leader that hides in the shadows.<br/>
The only daughter of the Bearheart family of knights becoming a Succubus. The truth is that this means that Iris can no longer revive the Bearheart family, as the Orbaume Kingdom considers Majin to be monsters, but nobody has realized this, including Iris herself.<br/>
She was a noble, but an unimportant one. Iris hadn’t been particularly eager to restore her family to begin with, but it seems that she has forgotten this idea entirely ever since Vandalieu gave her the sword that contains the spirit of her deceased father George.<br/>
Debis, Haj and the other core resistance members also think that she would be happier as a citizen of Talosheim than of the Orbaume Kingdom, so nobody even bothers thinking of the fact that her family line has ended.<br/>
In fact, as a Cursed Weapon, George would be considered a monster rather than a person in the Orbaume Kingdom, no different from a filthy Undead, so a countless number of troubles would have awaited Iris had she returned to the Orbaume Kingdom.<br/>
When she was fatally wounded, she decided that she never wanted to disgrace herself again and asked Vandalieu to transform her into a powerful race, becoming a Succubus as a result. She had thought that she would become a Battle-Majin Diablo.<br/>
The colors of her skin and eyes have changed, and she has gained horns, wings and a tail, but her overall appearance hasn’t changed from when she was a human. However, perhaps because the Vitality price required for the Majin transformation was paid by Legion’s flesh, her figure has become slightly more abundant. And because she has acquired the Passive Skill called Allure, the feminine charm that she unconsciously exudes has also increased.<br/>
And she has been given clothes that are the latest trend in the Majin nation… her Chichi-ue is worried about her.<br/>
Godwin, who has become her other ‘parent,’ does not seem to be worried, however.<br/>
When she was a human, her ability in combat was actually inferior to Kasim and Fester. She was perhaps equal with them only because she wielded George as her weapon. This is because adventurers like Kasim and his companions spend their days in the Dungeons to continuously gain experience, while the leader of a resistance organization does not experience battle very frequently.<br/>
Her potential has increased greatly since she transformed into a Succubus, but as she has only just transformed, she cannot make good use of this potential yet.<br/>
But because her talents as a monster have increased, it will likely not be just a dream for her to be as powerful as an S-class adventurer if she wields Nemesis George, the dark magic sword.<br/>
Isla – Vampire Countess Zombie, mid-30’s in physical appearance, female<br/>
She was formerly one of the ‘Five Dogs,’ the close aides of the Pure-breed Vampire Ternecia. Now, she serves as captain of the Dark Night Knights’ Order, an order of knights that are all Vampire Zombies. Though she appears to be an evil female executive, she actually works very seriously, and everyone around her including Vandalieu appreciates this.<br/>
After her guard duties at the southern side of the marshlands, she was equipped by Vandalieu and taken to the Sauron region. And now, she is using her skills to work as a research assistant for Vandalieu and Luciliano below Talosheim’s royal castle.<br/>
In Talosheim, she has never had the opportunity to make use of her Torture Skill, with which she is very proficient, but she is happy that she has had the opportunity to use it recently.<br/>
Her Rank increased when she defeated the ‘King Slayer’ Sleygar; she now has the same Rank that she had when she was alive and ‘Broken’ has been removed from her race title. Her Skills have developed as well, so it is thought that her overall strength surpasses the strength she possessed while alive.<br/>

Kasim – Human, 18 years old, male<br/>
A former adventurer who migrated from a cultivation village in the Hartner Duchy. Because the events in the cultivation villages of the Hartner Duchy were covered up, the Adventurers’ Guild believes that he is deceased.<br/>
But he has gained remarkable strength after migrating to Talosheim; he possessed abilities beyond those of an average C-class adventurer before participating in the war.<br/>
And then he was suddenly called upon by Vandalieu to take part in the war. Kasim is not quite sure why…<br/>
Though he had collided with a wall in his development, he was able to overcome it in one fell swoop by dealing the final blow to Gargya, the High Kobold Beast King. He will likely be able to go through his next Job-change soon.<br/>
He has been acknowledged by the men of the Centaur and Ghoul nations, expanding his circle of friends, but… the all-important spring still hasn’t come for him. Even though it has come for his two close friends that are his party members.<br/>
When will spring come for him…? But there have been unconfirmed reports that he has recently been frequently visiting a certain woman, so spring might visit him unexpectedly soon after all.<br/>

Zeno – Human, 18 years old, male<br/>
Like Kasim and Fester, he is an adventurer that was once an inhabitant of a cultivation village. He has kind of guessed why Vandalieu suddenly summoned him. Ordinarily, people would not invite someone to participate in a war for a reason like that, but Vandalieu is far from ordinary.<br/>
But like Kasim, he feels like he was not able to fulfill that reason. The Empusa Berserker Gaol kind of called out to him after he saved her life on the battlefield, but he seems to be under the impression that she was inviting him on a trip as adventurers.<br/>
This is because Zeno is ignorant when it comes to love, and because Gaol’s words of invitation were phrases that are not associated with love at all, such as “Let’s go hunting” and “Won’t you go to a Dungeon with me?”<br/>
Perhaps because of this, even Kasim and Fester are unable to point out to him that she might be inviting him to a date.<br/>
When will Zeno see the spring that has come for him?<br/>

Fester – Human, 18 years old, male<br/>
A former inhabitant of a cultivation village, now an adventurer. A second spring that he was never looking for has come for him. He is currently discussing things with Lina.<br/>
He is flustered, never having expected that such talks would be brought before a mere adventurer (explorer), one who was born in a poor cultivation village at that.<br/>
Lina was an employee of an Adventurers’ Guild branch, but she is not particularly knowledgeable about these matters. “It’s not abnormal for high-ranking adventurers to have multiple wives, but you’re still medium-rank, aren’t you?!” she said to Fester, scolding him when he told the other party that he would take the topic home to discuss.<br/>
In any case, the two of them have decided to meet this Ojou-san and discuss things with her.<br/>
Incidentally, Fester’s abilities place him beyond what the Adventurers’ Guild would consider an average C-class adventurer, so it shouldn’t be long before he becomes as capable as a high-ranking (B-class) adventurer, but in Talosheim’s Adventurers’ Guild, where the average capabilities are high, he is still “medium-rank.”<br/>

Miles Rouge – Abyssal Vampire Count, several hundred years old, male<br/>
A former subordinate of the Pure-breed Vampire Gubamon. He was dispatched to assist the Sauron Liberation Front.<br/>
Though he possessed the flexible thinking and decisiveness that allowed him to completely discard his pride, at the time, he looked down on humans as inferior creatures that were merely prey for him and his kind.<br/>
This was a sense of values that was necessary to have in order to live in a society of Vampires that worshipped an evil god, but that sense of values has fallen apart completely since he came to Talosheim. This has been especially true since he was dispatched to the Sauron Liberation Front; every time he remembers his former self, he sighs and thinks, “I have no idea what I was thinking back then.”<br/>
He learned from experience that one’s sense of values is heavily influenced by their position and the community they belong to. Thus, he shows an understanding for the actions of the Fifteen Evil-breaking Swords. Just because he understands them doesn’t mean that he intends to get along with them, however.<br/>
He transformed into an Abyssal Vampire by sunbathing while drinking Blood Potion, and he has become even more effective in combat than Ternecia’s Five Dogs. However, he was unable to overcome Ervine.<br/>

Cuoco Ragdew – Human, 32 years old, male<br/>
A former baron of the Amid Empire. The founder of his family, which was founded three generations ago, was an adventurer whose achievements allowed him to become a nobleman by marrying into the previously-fallen Ragdew family of dukes.<br/>
And Cuoco, the child of the current third generation is a strange one, having been brought up on the stories of his former-adventurer grandfather since he was old enough to understand them.<br/>
He has been educated in the social etiquette and courtesy that a nobleman should show, but also educated in a way that he would be able to survive as an adventurer or mercenary because nobody knew when the family would collapse again. Thus, he shows glimpses of nobleman-like demeanor and words, but he has actually turned out to be quite the strange person.<br/>
Ever since his grandfather’s generation, the family has been fanatical about delicious food, and even though his grandfather possessed the ability to achieve enough to become a baron, the reason he became an adventurer was his insatiable desire to eat delicious food to his heart’s content. The reason he became a nobleman was so that he could eat the imperial court’s food, which he would be unable to do as a commoner.<br/>
With a grandfather like this, Cuoco himself is a true glutton as well.<br/>
But because Cuoco’s father, the second generation, repeatedly spent extravagant amounts on food, the finances of the Ragdew family of barons are in dire straits. That was why he had led a private force of adventurers and mercenaries who had been close to the family since his grandfather’s generation, exterminating monsters to acquire food ingredients and a daily living.<br/>
Even though he was a nobleman of a military family, he wasn’t a member of a knights’ order, encroaching on others’ occupations despite being a baron with no responsibilities. This gained him the suspicion of the other noblemen.<br/>
On top of that, he was always wary that his house could collapse at any time, so he was lacking in patriotism. Because his superiors knew this, and because he had a vast debt, they sent him to the Sauron region.<br/>
He has a wife, a young daughter and a son who can walk. He does not have any concubines or illegitimate children. It is not that he believes in true love; it is simply that he does not have the desire, money or the pressure from those around him to have more women.<br/>
Even a servant would not offer his daughter to marry a debt-ridden family of barons that would likely collapse within the next generation.<br/>
As a former nobleman of the Amid Empire, he was a follower of the gods that support Alda. He prayed to not one, but many of them… though that was simply because he didn’t have a deep enough belief to worship a particular god.<br/>
Those cooperating with the resistance realized this and saw him as a potential informant, and he yielded easily to the syrup that Iris offered him.<br/>
Now, following his desertion to Talosheim, he is working as a civil official under Kurt’s command. But he is still engrossed by delicious foods, and whenever he has free time, he and his family walk behind Eisen, who offers the base ingredient of the syrup that he loves.<br/>
He actually has the combat skills of a D-class adventurer and an ability to command beyond that, so he is useful as a commander on the battlefield as well.<br/>
David Marme – Human, 50 years old, male<br/>
A member of the Amid Empire’s imperial family and current head of the Marme family of dukes, which possesses a vast amount of land. He truly believes that nobles are completely different creatures from commoners. Incidentally, those of Vida’s races are not people to him. Those he can collect taxes from are livestock, and those he can’t are pests.<br/>
He is the son of the younger brother of the current emperor, and he became a duke by being adopted into the Marme family of dukes that had no heir.<br/>
This has allowed him to live a luxurious life up until now, but it also caused him to fall back in the line of inheritance to the throne. Thus, he resents Marshukzarl whom he believes took the throne from him, and this is the root of his antagonism for Marshukzarl.<br/>
He tried to make the ‘Thunderclap’ Schneider exterminate Vandalieu by placing a request for him to investigate the region beyond the Boundary Mountain Range, but that was just another plot to gain an achievement for himself and lower Marshukzarl’s standing.<br/>
A zealous follower of Alda, he is heavily attached… connected, to the Church of Alda. It is simple for him to force priestesses to live secular lives and allocate them to people as a part of a reward.<br/>
In truth, David was actually on the top of Schneider’s list of noblemen that he wants to beat to death. But there are no settlements of Vida’s races in the duke’s land, and those who were able to move already moved to regions ruled by other noblemen before David became the head of his house. And despite his incompetence, David holds a high position in society, so it would cause a large incident if Schneider were to lay a hand on him. Thus, David is quite low on Schneider’s overall list of priorities.<br/>
When he was at the army headquarters, he was captured by Vandalieu and abducted after having the skin of his head from the neck up removed by Isla’s knife.<br/>
Currently, the various ‘horrible people’ among the military and civil officials David brought from his own realm are being used for various experiments such as transplants of body parts made of the Demon King’s fragments.<br/>
Bugitas – Noble Orc Plunder King, 12 years old, male<br/>
Bugitas had a strong complex due to the differences between him and his older brother, and he fell to the temptations of Ravovifard, the evil god of release.<br/>
With his desire to surpass his brother released, he received Ravovifard’s divine protection and the False Guidance: Beast Path Skill, gaining power beyond that of his brother.<br/>
But after surpassing his brother, he did not possess any concrete outlooks for the future. Ravovifard whispered to Bugitas that he should conquer all of the lands enclosed by the Boundary Mountain Range. He pushed forward for this reckless objective, believing that it was his own ambition.<br/>
He did not realize he was nothing more than Ravovifard’s puppet until the moment Ravovifard took over his body.<br/>
His main subordinates were Budirud, Bufudin, Bumogan, Bukyap and Bugoba, who were generals of the empire, and Chief General Buzazeos.<br/>
He also gained the High Kobold Gargya, the Majin Gerazorg and the High Goblin Gido as allies, as they had previously studied abroad in the empire and felt similar feelings towards their kings as he did.<br/>
He is currently the enemy who has provided the most memorably delicious meat that Vandalieu has tasted.<br/>
Ravovifard – Evil god<br/>
The evil god of release. When he was a part of the Demon King’s army, he was in an even lower position than Fidirg, but he rose to power after the Demon King’s fall.<br/>
He has a self-serving personality as evil gods do, thinking of his followers as nothing but pawns or livestock.<br/>
He originally ruled the Dark Continent, but he was defeated by Zantark and Farmaun. He fled to the area within the Boundary Mountain Range on the continent of Bahn Gaia and plotted his revenge against Zantark and Farmaun, using Bugitas to try and regain his power.<br/>
He possessed Bugitas’s body and descended upon the world, even if his descent was not complete, but he was attacked countless times by Budarion, Borkus and others who were wielding weapons made of the Demon King’s fragments, and then half of his body was destroyed by the enraged Vandalieu. Finally, the gods of the southern region of the continent sealed him away.<br/>
On top of that, he was completely destroyed as his soul was eaten by Vandalieu, who didn’t think of it as any more than a snack.<br/>
An evil god who would have been delicious boiled or roasted, but was best eaten raw.<br/>
Godwin – Battle-Majin Diablo, several thousand years old, male<br/>
The current king of the Majin. He has a three-meter tall body covered in muscles, blue skin, golden eyes, two thick horns, a pair of wings and a tail.<br/>
He is a man who loves drinking and fighting more than anything else, and he hates work, especially deskwork. His term of office as king will soon come to an end, so he is excitedly waiting for that to happen.<br/>
He was taken care of by Gerazorg’s great-grandmother, so he has taken care of Gerazorg in various ways, but the coup d’état attempt cut his last thread of patience.<br/>
In a fit of anger, he personally departed the nation and grouped up with the other nations. He tried to tell everyone that he needed to “set things straight” and “this is a problem that I’m dealing with not as a king, but as a man.” But since his disposition was well-known among the leaders of the other nations, nobody believed him.<br/>
Of course, he was scolded by his subordinates upon returning to his nation.<br/>
As for why such a person became the king of the Majin in the first place, it was because the tournament to select the Majin king had a bonus prize of alcohol, which was of a brand that he liked.<br/>
It seems that Vandalieu will become the emperor, and Godwin gained a daughter (Iris), so he plans to retire once his term is over.<br/>
Incidentally, the relationship between Godwin and Xerx, the god of battle flags, is not one between that of a god and his follower, but more like that between an obstinate old man and a selfish kid.<br/>
Mububujenge – Guardian deity of the Noble Orc kingdom<br/>
The evil god of degenerate corpulence. A goddess who was imprisoned this volume. However, her appearance is the kind that would cause insanity if looked upon.<br/>
She has a generally lazy personality, she will go to any lengths to spend her time lazing about and sleeping.<br/>
Her passion for being lazy was the reason she accepted Zakkart’s invitation and betrayed the Demon King’s army, the reason she joined Vida to fight Alda’s faction and the reason she protects the Noble Orcs that are her servants.<br/>
The reason she gave the Orcs flesh-wives made from her own flesh was so that the Noble Orc empire would stay stable and they would continue to worship her.<br/>
Unlike Ravovifard, she is not self-serving; she takes action believing that as a god in a higher position, giving those in lower positions what she can will lead to her own desires being fulfilled.<br/>
She possesses considerable affection for the Noble Orcs and those who live in their nation. But she has none for Noble Orcs and Orcs of nations that do not worship her and those that spawn in Dungeons.<br/>
Rishare – guardian deity of the High Kobold nation, subordinate god of Vida<br/>
The god of hunting, one of Vida’s subordinate gods.<br/>
In the age of the gods, there were eleven great gods in Lambda and eight gods of the attributes. Thus, there were countless discussions over which gods would rule over the sun and the moon.<br/>
For the sun, the god of the fire attribute Zantark raised his hand because the sun emits heat; the god of the time attribute Ricklent raised his hand because the sun gives the time through sundials; the goddess of the life attribute Vida raised her hand as the sun gives blessings to living things; and the giant god Zerno raised his hand as well. In the end, a clear decision could not be made, so it was decided that the subordinate gods of these gods would have the role divided among them. The ‘Sun Giant’ Talos, parent of the Titans, was one of them.<br/>
In the same way, there were discussions over which god should rule over hunting. But unlike the discussion over the sun, no god wanted this role.<br/>
This was because this would be a difficult role, having to work with both the beast-kings that were the subordinates of the beast-god Ganpaplio and the humans.<br/>
Though creatures had been made to serve as nourishment for the humans, over-hunting would be a problem. The god in this role would have to teach and regulate the humans, who at the time had only just been born, and keep the beast-kings appeased. Thus, everyone expected that the god in this role would go through a lot of trouble.<br/>
The one who volunteered for this role was Rishare. And so, Rishare, a familiar spirit of Vida’s who was fired up with ideals, became the god of hunting… and learned of reality through enduring hardships upon hardships.<br/>
As for why Rishare became the guardian deity of the High Kobolds, it is because the evil god of Vida’s faction who created the High Kobolds was sealed during the battle that occurred a hundred thousand years ago.<br/>
With that being the case, the High Kobolds would have ended up with no guardian deity. They would have been left with no choice but to divide themselves among the other nations, unable to form their own. That was why Rishare had volunteered to become their guardian deity.<br/>
Even after he learned of reality, it seems that he drew the short straw.<br/>
Incidentally, as he was a god who was originally created by Vida as a familiar spirit, his gender is not defined. Depending on the era, some followers treat him as a goddess and others as a god.<br/>
Zozogante – Guardian deity of the Ghoul nation<br/>
The evil god of the dark forest. In the ranks of the Demon King’s army, his position was low, equivalent to Fidirg’s.<br/>
He has the appearance of a black tree with eyeballs hanging from its branches like fruit. His appearance is repulsive, but as his appearance suggests, his nature is similar to that of a plant; he has always been considered relatively quiet, even when he was still a part of the Demon King’s army.<br/>
After the founder of the Ghoul race was defeated, he became the Ghouls’ guardian deity and gave them a D-class Dungeon that he himself created, Zozogante’s Great Forest, for them to live in.<br/>
Because every floor of the Dungeon is a forest, large-scale agriculture is impossible, but there are Gante trees that grow fruit that replace grains in the Ghouls’ diet growing here and there in the Dungeon.<br/>
These Gante trees are actually something like immature forms of Zozogante’s familiars, and if they gather enough Mana, they transform into Gante Ents, which are Rank 4 plant-type monsters.<br/>
He is currently planting trees in Talosheim. Unlike Gante Ents, these trees have fruits that look just like eyeballs. They have the same properties of Gante fruit in that the flesh of both fruits tastes similar to that of lychees, and both fruits have hard seeds at their cores.<br/>
Marshukzarl Von Bellwood Amid – Half-Elf, ? years old, male<br/>
The person who has made the worst of moves this volume.<br/>
But to explain his actions, judging from currently-known theories and common knowledge, the dispatchment of four members of the Fifteen Evil-breaking Swords was not an incorrect decision.<br/>
It is clear that Vandalieu utilizes Undead and that he is capable of conducting large-scale contamination with disease and poison, but according to previous magical knowledge, this would require extraordinary costs in terms of Mana and live sacrifices.<br/>
Marshukzarl considered the possibility that Vandalieu was using the Demon King’s fragments, but since it is only possible for someone to use only one or perhaps two fragments at most without losing their sanity, he thought that members of the Fifteen Evil-breaking Swords wielding Artifacts would have no problem defeating him.<br/>
But because Vandalieu is in another dimension from currently-known theories and common knowledge, everything backfired.<br/>
The loss of Rickert in particular was a hard blow on Marshukzarl. The reason he had assigned Rickert to being an advertisement for the Fifteen Evil-breaking Swords was so that Rickert could still carry out his duty as a member of the imperial family while still staying safe. Marshukzarl had also ordered the ‘Five-headed Snake’ Ervine stay close to Rickert for that reason.<br/>
With the violent death of a national hero that he had personally dispatched, as well as the abandonment of the Sauron region, he took heavy political damage. But Duke Marme, the main opposition, was abducted, so his position on the throne is currently still stable.<br/>
But the loss of four members of the Fifteen Evil-breaking Swords and a considerable number of members of the Hilt was heavy damage indeed.<br/>
Farmaun Gold – Heroic god of fire<br/>
A heroic god who has ruled over the fire attribute as a member of Alda’s faction ever since Zantark fused with evil gods.<br/>
Before he became a god, he made many efforts to revive humanity, such as founding the Adventurers’ Guild.<br/>
When he lived on Earth, his name was Touyama Kinji. He was a university student who wished to be an adventurer, a sports-minded older-brother-like figure.<br/>
<br/>
TLN: The kanji for his Japanese name probably explains his current name. The kanji for his surname is ‘far mountain’ (Farmaun), his given name being vaguely related to gold.<br/>
<br/>
After this, he was summoned to Lambda. Rather than listening to Zakkart’s mature, realistic arguments, he listened to Bellwood’s simple-to-understand arguments whose surfaces were covered by the ideals of a young person (that were hollow beneath those surfaces).<br/>
For Farmaun in particular, who enjoyed being physically active and liked the ideas of adventure and fighting, Bellwood’s arguments sounded pleasant to listen to and convenient because he just needed to fight.<br/>
But after Bellwood and the evil god of sinful chains struck each other down, he was forced to think with his own head, and he began to doubt his actions up until then for the first time.<br/>
Now, he continues to rule over the fire attribute as he remains close to Zantark on the Dark Continent.<br/>
