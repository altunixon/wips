<br/>
A bit anti-climactic. Stay tuned for the touching finale.<br/>
Chapter 125: Possibilities<br/>
"Not Yet! Report your situation!" (Naofumi)<br/>
"The people who received the attack have yet to recover. We are confirming the situation." (Soldier)<br/>
How is the front line holding up?<br/>
I look towards Rafatalia and Firo, who are currently battling around the heart.<br/>
The assaulting familiars seem to be endless. Both of them are exhausted.<br/>
When the chance comes, they break through and reach my location, but their faces are pale.<br/>
"A-are you two alright?!" (Naofumi)<br/>
"Y-yes… but… my Mana is…" (Rafatalia)<br/>
"Yeah… you know… they absorbed our mana…" (Firo)<br/>
Ku… how troublesome. This attack has the same effect as the electric blast from the head.<br/>
I receive an information report from the back line.<br/>
"A large number of troops have died from Mana depletion." (Soldier)<br/>
"How is the situation on the front?" (Naofumi)<br/>
"Because of the Hero of the Shield’s protection, they have begun to prepare the sealing magic for the heart." (Soldier)<br/>
"I see…" (Naofumi)<br/>
For my Drain resistance to come in handy in a place like this…<br/>
The casualties are great, but we will still be able to carry out the mission.<br/>
"It might be difficult, but please finish the sealing preparations as quickly as possible!" (Naofumi)<br/>
"S-sir yes sir!" (Magicians)<br/>
By this pattern…<br/>
The Spirit turtle’s heart begins releasing the magic energy it has stored up.<br/>
I rush in front and hold up my shield to deflect the blasts of energy.<br/>
"_____________!" (Spirit Turtle)<br/>
"Gu-…" (Naofumi)<br/>
The output is even higher than before.<br/>
The white masses the heart had released are now re-assimilating with it to increase the output.<br/>
Long! The duration of this attack is much higher than any of the others I have withstood. My HP begins to drop.<br/>
"Guuuuuuuuu-…" (Naofumi)<br/>
I can’t change my position or the blast will be reflected on our forces.<br/>
"Mu… Don’t use Firo’s power to hurt Master!" (Firo)<br/>
Firo takes a stance.<br/>
"Rafatalia Oneechan, Costume wearing Oneechan! Please keep monsters away from Firo for a little bit." (Firo)<br/>
"Y-yes!" (Rafatalia)<br/>
"I Understand!" (Rishia)<br/>
Rafatalia and Rishia get into formation and repel the swarms of monsters from Firo.<br/>
"Suuuuuuuuuuuuuuu…" (Firo)<br/>
Firo takes a very deep breath.<br/>
I can feel the wind gathering around her.<br/>
The white masses that had returned to the heart are being pulled away.<br/>
More specifically, Firo is sucking them in.<br/>
The white clumps are forcefully pulled towards Firo, being drawn to her strong magic.<br/>
Soon, the magic blast weakens.<br/>
"Good job, Firo!" (Naofumi)<br/>
"Gepu-" (Firo)<br/>
I look behind me and see Firo waving happily. She looks slightly more inflated than before.<br/>
…Did she eat those things?<br/>
"Payback." (Firo)<br/>
Firo faces the heart and opens her mouth. Something comes out.<br/>
I think it is the air that she sucked into her body.<br/>
A sphere of pressurized air flies towards the heart.<br/>
"_______!!!" (Spirit Turtle)<br/>
The turtle hastily deploys a magic barrier around its heart, as if it sensed the dangers presented by Firo’s attack.<br/>
The familiars, as if protecting the organ, fly head on into the ball of air.<br/>
But the sphere merely sucks in any monster that gets close, and continues to fly at the heart.<br/>
A large sound fills the area, and the magic barrier around the heart breaks.<br/>
The heart is reconstructing its defenses. It’s the perfect time to activate the seal.<br/>
"Now!" (Naofumi)<br/>
"Ha!" (Magicians)<br/>
"We have read and understood the origin of power. It is the time for the Truth of the world to manifest. Now become that chains that binds one of the four: the Spirit Turtle, this beast of Calamity! "<br/>
A large magic circle appears centered around the heart.<br/>
The turtle is currently focused on healing the damage caused by Firo’s attack, it is unable to perform a follow-up attack.<br/>
This is the end!<br/>
「Large Scale Covenant Spell: ‘Magic Sealing’!」<br/>
Ribbons appear from the magic circle,and begin encircling the heart, which has almost finished repairing itself.<br/>
"____________!?" (Spirit Turtle)<br/>
Badump… badump… ba… dump… ba… (TL: If you have a better onomatopoeia, be my guest.)<br/>
The beating sound of the heart gets fainter, and eventually fades into nothingness.<br/>
The monsters outside seem to have also stopped. From the next room, I can hear some noise.<br/>
"YYYEEEEAAASSSS!" (Soldiers)<br/>
They are celebrating.<br/>
"Victory! We Won!" (Soldier)<br/>
"Hooray!" (Soldier)<br/>
"It was long and difficult, but we finally did it!" (Soldier)<br/>
(TL: death flags all around)<br/>
Fuu……..<br/>
"Oneechan, Firo is returning these." (Firo)<br/>
"? Firo, what are you doing?" (Rafatalia)<br/>
Firo suddenly throws up all of the white clumps she had inhaled at Rafatalia. Are they Spirit attribute? Maybe I should absorb them.<br/>
Rafatalia’s face color is getting better as the Drain effect wears off, but her expression is getting much, much worse. It’s as if a bug had dropped down her back.<br/>
Slapping the White clumps away, Rafatalia begins chasing Firo around in rage.<br/>
"Oy, Firo! I definitely won’t let you off easily!" (Rafatalia)<br/>
"Ahaha~" (Firo)<br/>
*Sigh* It seems we were somehow able to finish the sealing.<br/>
"…- Master!?" (Firo)<br/>
Firo suddenly stops. Her face is pale.<br/>
Badump! Badump!<br/>
The heart beat sounds resume.<br/>
With the sound of breaking glass, the magic circle breaks apart.<br/>
"How could this be!?" (Naofumi)<br/>
"Firo did her best, so why?" (Firo)<br/>
The eye on the heart grows very large, and releases the beam attack once more.<br/>
"This thing knows not when to give in!" (Rafatalia)<br/>
"Yeah!" (Firo)<br/>
"Was it a failure?" (Naofumi)<br/>
"No… the spell went perfectly… but it was able to shrug it off with ease." (Magician)<br/>
Dammit! Damn it all!<br/>
We don’t have any forces left. The head has regenerated. We cannot seal the heart.<br/>
… No there still has to be a way. I can’t give in.<br/>
"Rafatalia, Firo, can you handle it?" (Naofumi)<br/>
"Leave it to me." (Rafatalia)<br/>
"Yes!" (Firo)<br/>
Both Rafatalia and Firo prepare to unleash their respective strongest attacks.<br/>
Even though it’s broken free, there must be some information I can gain from this exchange.<br/>
"Tell the troops in the back lines to fall back!" (Naofumi)<br/>
"B-but-" (Soldier)<br/>
"If possible, try to support these two, otherwise, tell them to focus on protecting themselves. Worse comes to worst we will have to retreat!" (Naofumi)<br/>
"U-understood!" (Soldier)<br/>
The army follows my command and withdraws the back line.<br/>
And Rafatalia, Firo, Me, Shadow and Rishia prepare for battle.<br/>
「Zveit Aura」 (Naofumi)<br/>
I cast support magic on the party. The two rush forward.<br/>
「Spiral Strike!」 (Firo)<br/>
「Hakke Destiny Slash」 (Rafatalia)<br/>
(TL: Hakke, Japanese pronounciation for Bagua http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bagua)<br/>
Forward! This may be rash, but there are no other options.<br/>
"_________!?" (Spirit Turtle)<br/>
The two fighters rush the Heart of the Spirit Turtle. The turtle tries to summon familiars to protect it.<br/>
But those two are putting all their magic remaining into this strike. The familiars have no effect.<br/>
There is a grotesque sound. The heart has been pierced.<br/>
"…" (Rafatalia)<br/>
"This is the limit" (Firo)<br/>
"I understand… please stand down." (Naofumi)<br/>
I observe the heart. Just as when it had been sealed, the beating has stopped. Did we do it?<br/>
Most of the arteries around it have been reduced to scraps of flesh. The heart itself has a large hole in the center.<br/>
If it could recover from this, it would truly be immortal.<br/>
…badump.<br/>
___!?<br/>
Before my very eyes, the arteries restore themselves and the hole begins to close.<br/>
"Wha…" (Rafatalia)<br/>
"What tenacity…" (Naofumi)<br/>
"Fueeeeeeeeeee…" (Rishia)<br/>
I also want to say Fueeee.<br/>
"The mission… was a failure-gojaru. We must call a retreat-gojaru." (Shadow)<br/>
"And after that? Can the seven star heroes win against a Monster like this?" (Naofumi)<br/>
Out of rage, I unintentionally speak my mind.<br/>
"T-that may be so-jaru… but staying here will not accomplish anything-gojaru." (Shadow)<br/>
"Ku…" (Naofumi)<br/>
Shadow’s right. Nothing has come out of fighting for hours inside of this thing.<br/>
Where is it getting all of this vitality?<br/>
If a monster like this appeared in a game, then no one would buy it.<br/>
"… I understand. We’ll retreat for now and think of another plan." (Naofumi)<br/>
"… Sir yes sir." (Soldier)<br/>
The hearts of the soldiers is heavy.<br/>
To fail after we had found victory. The mental damage inflicted is quite high.<br/>
Carefully avoiding danger, I lead the men away from the heart and out of the Turtle’s body.<br/>
"It will be easier to escape from the town than from the mountains." (Naofumi)<br/>
The mountain path is heavily sloped. With the earthquakes caused by the moving turtle, the footing is unstable.<br/>
Though we may have to deal with the rubble, it will probably be safer to dismount from the town area.<br/>
"We are thankful to you for finding a safe escape route." (Commander)<br/>
The army’s commander gives me words of thanks.<br/>
"Don’t mind it. Protecting is my duty." (Naofumi)<br/>
But… for all our efforts to come out in vain…<br/>
The only information we got was that the sealing magic didn’t work.<br/>
Is there no way to win?<br/>
I fend off monsters as we head towards the exit in the town.<br/>
"This is…" (Naofumi)<br/>
It’s a building similar to the temple I investigated with Firo.<br/>
"It seems to be a temple-gojaru." (Shadow)<br/>
"You can tell?" (Naofumi)<br/>
"I have been trained in scouting out buildings-gojaru. There are lithographs of the messages left by the heroes all over the place -gojaru." (Shadow)<br/>
"Lithographs? Are they of the message I saw in the other temple?" (Naofumi)<br/>
"Perhaps these were made using that as reference-gojaru. Selling lithographs of these messages was this town’s specialty-gojaru. There were probably more but the entire town has been destroyed with the awakening of the Turtle-gojaru." (Shadow)<br/>
Reference? Could there have been people who could write in Japanese here?<br/>
Hmm… so this temple contains various lithographs…<br/>
Keiichi left the method of defeating the turtle. Perhaps, I may find a lithograph of his message.<br/>
"Can you let me look around for a bit?" (Naofumi)<br/>
"I do not believe now is the time for that-gojaru" (Shadow)<br/>
""The previous message I saw had writing regarding how to defeat the Spirit Turtle. However the most important info was left out. (Naofumi)<br/>
"How surprising, then we must search through these records-gojaru." (Shadow)<br/>
My party and the rest of the army search for and gather all the Lithographs we can find.<br/>
These paintings are not very well done, they seem to be mass-produced varieties, with a simple picture of the Turtle and words printed on them.<br/>
And these works have also been damaged by the Turtle’s movements.<br/>
"Can you read it-gojaru?" (Shadow)<br/>
"How is it?" (Rafatalia)<br/>
Like a jig-saw puzzle, I gather the pieces of various mass produced pictures. Many of these have shattered beyond recognition. I don’t think I can decipher this.<br/>
"I have found more." (Rishia)<br/>
Rishia comes carrying a large fragment of a Lithograph.<br/>
… Finally, something I can read.<br/>
Even more so than the wave, his objective is… to stop…<br/>
I can also make out the words Head, Heart and Same.<br/>
I have to think, what would the Hero Keiichi want to leave behind?<br/>
Along with the head, you must… to defeat this monster, then… It’s cut off here.<br/>
Now that I think about it, from the start, Keiichi has been talking of a method to defeat, rather than seal it.<br/>
So in the past, people had already figured out the method for defeating it.<br/>
So why was it sealed until now?<br/>
I don’t understand.<br/>
If I can’t understand this point, I have to move onto the next.<br/>
I must gather some useful information from this.<br/>
Head, Heart, Same were used on the same line.<br/>
… Could it be that? That thing in Games and Manga…<br/>
(TL: You know that thing in Megaman EXE and in Neon Genesis Evangelion, that thing.)<br/>
However there is no way of testing that theory.<br/>
"What?! Is that true?!" (Soldier)<br/>
As I am deep in thought, the army people are getting noisy.<br/>
"What’s wrong?" (Naofumi)<br/>
"Look outside. The Spirit Turtle is approaching a city that hasn’t finished evacuation!" (Sodja Boy)<br/>
