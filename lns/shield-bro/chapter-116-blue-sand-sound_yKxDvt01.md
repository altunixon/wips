					Blue Sand Sound <br/>
 <br/>
I called Rafatalia, Firo and Rishia to test something. <br/>
I plan studying magic after this, but that can wait. <br/>
 <br/>
"Naofumi, what happen?" (Rafatalia) <br/>
"I have something to ask of you, Rafatalia" (Naofumi) <br/>
 <br/>
I remove the slave limiter preventing Rafatalia from attacking me. <br/>
I do this prior to the test because she will suffer due to the slave crest if I don't. <br/>
 <br/>
"I wanted to test the defense on the shield I've upgraded. I gave you permission to hit me." (Naofumi) <br/>
"Huh...." (Rafatalia) <br/>
"Try bare-handed first. Don't hold back." (Naofumi) <br/>
"I see." (Rafatalia) <br/>
 <br/>
While hesitant, Rafatalia hits my chest with great force. <br/>
The impact let out a loud sound. <br/>
But i felt no pain, only a sentation as if bitten by a mosquito. <br/>
Was this the extent of Rafatalia's fist...... <br/>
How would it turn out if i was struck by a sword? <br/>
Though it may be foolish, and it would be unpleasant to get wounded, I want to test out how much i can endure. <br/>
 <br/>
"Lets use a sword next" (Naofumi) <br/>
"Oh, that. Are you sure?" (Rishia) <br/>
 <br/>
Rishia asks fearfully. <br/>
I understand her feelings. If you look at it from an ordinary person's view, this doesn't look normal. <br/>
 <br/>
"I'm trying to see how much i can withstand" (Naofumi) <br/>
 <br/>
If i can endure one of Rafatalia's attacks, I feel I'd be fine for the moment. <br/>
I do not know how high my defense is, or if it's better. <br/>
 <br/>
"Here i go" (Rafatalia) <br/>
 <br/>
Rafatalis swings her sword at me with without serious intent, I can tell she held back somewhat. <br/>
A light sound is made as it hits my shoulder. <br/>
 <br/>
"This is hard...." (Rafatalia) <br/>
 <br/>
Rafatalia says in a tearful voice as she drops the Iron sword in her hand. <br/>
I did not recieve any damage. <br/>
This is amazing, It's as if my body has become metal. <br/>
My body is normal meat and flesh when i touch it. <br/>
 <br/>
Did i gain more muscle since coming to this world? <br/>
Including Lvs I feel this body has become on suitable for fighting. <br/>
Well i have been involved in a lot of fighting these 4 months. <br/>
Well i use more physical strength like in older times where one got around by foot or carriage. Can't even compare to  <br/>
 <br/>
the time when I was a geek. <br/>
 <br/>
"Firo next." (Firo) <br/>
"Oh, good." (Naofumi) <br/>
"Yay!" (Firo) <br/>
 <br/>
I uncheck Firo's demon crest. <br/>
I'll know i have great defense if i block one of Firo's attacks, I want to know. <br/>
 <br/>
 "Well then, let's go" (Naofumi?) <br/>
 <br/>
Firo changes into her demon form, she raises her leg high ready to kick. <br/>
Mississauga Mishimishimishi ...... ...... ...... Biki.[TL: this is onomatopoeia explained soon] <br/>
 <br/>
"Wh, what is....." (???) <br/>
 <br/>
The sound of Firo's powerful leg muscles contracting can be heard. <br/>
Past experiences can tell me. This is dangerous. <br/>
 <br/>
biki ......bikibikibiki![TL: More onomatopoeia ] <br/>
 <br/>
"It stopped"(Naofumi?) <br/>
"Yes!"(Firo) <br/>
 <br/>
I ready my shield at once. <br/>
With a roar, vibrations are felt. A shock runs through my whole body. <br/>
 <br/>
"You trying to kill!" <br/>
 <br/>
I may have been taken back if i didn't prepare myself. For this. <br/>
With a smile i gaze over at Firo, i can't complain. <br/>
I felt my eyebrows furrow for a moment. <br/>
 <br/>
"Wow, master is really sturdy" (Firo) <br/>
"What was that kick just now!" (Naofumi) <br/>
"Well, it's a kick using all the power, can't be used in real battle" (Firo?) <br/>
 <br/>
That was a serious kick from Firo...... She completely didn't take it easy. <br/>
 <br/>
"I use power as if kicking the Spear guy" (Firo) <br/>
 <br/>
I sympathize for Motoyasu, it's his end if he's kicked with this power. <br/>
I feel like watching that a little also. <br/>
 <br/>
"Want to go flying into the horizon?" (Firo?) <br/>
"You, think a little more about your actions!" (Naofumi?) <br/>
 <br/>
No, I'll definately be killed. <br/>
Wonder if the kick would send you into the horizon. <br/>
Or into a different world..... if you think of it like an anime. <br/>
 <br/>
However, I was able to establish the strength of my defense. <br/>
I was able to prevent all of Firo's power, which is comparable to Glass. <br/>
I do not know how much stronger, but i can anticipate further effects. <br/>
 <br/>
"Hmm......Alright"  <br/>
"That's not for you to decide, it's for me" <br/>
"Well i think that's ok" <br/>
 <br/>
Does this person have some wild perception? <br/>
That was a little scary, let's go check the items a second time. <br/>
 <br/>
"Well it's ok..... no one was injured... so let's go back for tonight" (Naofumi) <br/>
"Umm" (Rishia) <br/>
 <br/>
I turn slowly towards Rishia. <br/>
 <br/>
"Eh?" (Rishia) <br/>
"You don't need to do it, you are good." (Naofumi) <br/>
"Y, Yes" (Rishia) <br/>
 <br/>
I was not damaged by Firo, or Rafatalia. It would be impossible if Rishia tried. <br/>
It would be bad to strain oneself. <br/>
Though it feels like she has frail health, it is a defeat if it minds it. <br/>
 <br/>
"Since the next wave is near. Train you magic for today" (Naofumi) <br/>
 <br/>
You should raise your level in earnest. <br/>
Though Rafatalia seems to do simulation exercises with the knights. <br/>
 <br/>
"Yes" <br/>
"I understand" <br/>
"I'll go study with Firo and Mel chan" <br/>
"Let's go like that." <br/>
 <br/>
Because she is the princess of this country, it is natural, but Melty tends to only study in the castle. <br/>
Now that Bitch has been deprived of her inheritance rights, what such thing do you need as the next queen. <br/>
Maybe Monarch studies? There was a similar thing in my world. <br/>
It may be said that she studies every day and make it the utmost proper country. <br/>
Speaking of Melty, if i find spare time while being taught compounding and magic, i go to my place. <br/>
Studying with Firo can also be fun. <br/>
........Let's forget how i complained about being caught up with Firo while studying a few days ago. <br/>
Firo's head is not good, Melty's might also be going bad. Yeah. [idk] <br/>
 <br/>
Now that i have to time to myself, i think I'll strengthen...... the Wrath Shield for the time being. <br/>
 <br/>
Wrath shield â…¢ (awakened) +7 50/50 SR <br/>
 <br/>
Ability unsealed ...... equipment bonus, Skill [Change shield (attack),] [Iron Maiden] [Blutopfer]  <br/>
Special Effect: Dark Curse Burning S, Strength UP, Super( orMighty) Dragon's Rage, Roar, Frenzy of Companions,  <br/>
Magic Sharing, Clothing of Anger (medium). <br/>
Proficiency 0 <br/>
 <br/>
I seems the shield can't preform item, spirit and status enchantments. <br/>
Still it's abilities imporved tremendously. <br/>
The problem is, that the moment i switched to this it started trying to take over my consciousness, a fearsome  <br/>
 <br/>
problem. <br/>
 <br/>
Preperations for the wave are coming along well. <br/>
 <br/>
The next day. <br/>
3 days until the wave. <br/>
 <br/>
"Queen Speaking"[Knight?] <br/>
"What? "(Naofumi?) <br/>
 <br/>
After lunch a meeting with the queen was hailed. <br/>
Preperations are almost done, then just wait for the wave. <br/>
As is expected, it would be severe to fight against Glass with only us. <br/>
Which is why we gathered the heroes now, but who knows if they'll listen. <br/>
 <br/>
"How are you Heroes? How went the waves of other countries?" (Queen) <br/>
"Heroes, except Iwatani, participated in the wave of other countries between these few days and seem to have let  <br/>
 <br/>
you suppress it safely. Iwatani is alright....it isn't a big problem treating our country exclusively."(Queen) <br/>
""I'm anxious to say its a big problem but - Tsu!?"(Naofumi?) <br/>
 <br/>
A sound that could break glass is heard from the corner. <br/>
A big shock shook our heads. <br/>
The sound was similar to the Wave starting, but it was.....delicately different. <br/>
 <br/>
"....Something happened just now" <br/>
"?" <br/>
 <br/>
I look around. <br/>
Althought i though i was trasnferred to the wave, I didn't go anywhere, I was still in the castle hallway. <br/>
 <br/>
"What happened?"(???) <br/>
"I don't know...but something just happened that is certain"(Naofumi) <br/>
 <br/>
The call the icon of a red hourglass to check the wave in the corner field of my view. <br/>
The timer had stopped at 3 days. <br/>
Next to it another icon appears..... a blue hourglass with a "7" engraved into it. <br/>
 <br/>
"Another hourglass has appeared, with a 7 engraved into it, but i don't know what this means" (Naofumi) <br/>
 <br/>
Calling up the Help menu, i verify if there are no new items. <br/>
But it seems.... Information can not be found. <br/>
What's going on? <br/>
 <br/>
7 ... the story of the Seven Star Heroes, i recently heard the story. <br/>
Could it be? <br/>
 <br/>
"A Hero may have been defeated in some wave somewhere" <br/>
"However, these brave heroes participated in other waves, but just in case... I will look into other countries and seek  <br/>
 <br/>
information" <br/>
 <br/>
The Queen gave instructions to a messenger soldier to gather information. <br/>
The opening of the case was here ......
