Guess who's back? <br/>
 <br/>
Chapter 61 <br/>
 <br/>
Persuasion <br/>
 <br/>
"Wow......" <br/>
 <br/>
I muttered unintentionally while looking around the checkpoints at the border to the north east. <br/>
The reason I muttered is due to the enormous amount of knights patrolling the border. <br/>
Did they bring a while army for this? <br/>
What're you going to do if another country attacks. That trash...... <br/>
Well, I was certainly expecting soldiers, but this amount is ridiculous. <br/>
 <br/>
"The devil of the shield will surely escape to Silt Welt! Do not miss him!" <br/>
"Roger!" <br/>
 <br/>
So insufferably annoying...... <br/>
They are being strict enough with the border patrol that not even ants can escape. <br/>
If it were just Raphtalia, Firo, and I we may be able to break through the front, but now we have to worry about the second princess. <br/>
It is probably impossible. <br/>
Even If we do charge in from the front the other Heroes may also be here...... <br/>
 <br/>
Well they shouldn't have recovered completely from the last wave yet though. <br/>
Me charging in alone while they try to sneak past is also not going to work...... <br/>
However, how did they find out I was going to Silt Welt? <br/>
They probably figured that would be the most disadvantageous country for them. <br/>
Either way, my imagination is running wild. <br/>
 <br/>
"What do we do?...... We can't pass the barricade, should we change roads?" <br/>
"Impossible......" <br/>
 <br/>
The second princess mutters. <br/>
 <br/>
"Why would it be impossible?" <br/>
"This seems to be an emergency deployment. Warnings will resound once people cross national borders, and soldiers will rush there." <br/>
"That's pretty severe......" <br/>
 <br/>
I imagine something like an infra-red alarm system. These guys probably have something like this set up along the border. <br/>
Even if we just camp a mountain it will only be a matter of time before we are discovered. <br/>
 <br/>
"Firo can you evade them while pulling the wagon?" <br/>
"They were warned. It is impossible to get away since they have the warning line." <br/>
"Hmm...... They are strangely detailed." <br/>
"This is my mother's emergency plan, no expenses were spared since it will be used in emergencies after all." <br/>
"It's quite elaborate......" <br/>
 <br/>
My Killing intent rises. <br/>
Though there is nothing I can do to release it. <br/>
 <br/>
"Can't we escape to Silt Welt through another country?" <br/>
 <br/>
The closest border is here, and we cannot choose any others. <br/>
We ended up bumping to a villager from the neighbouring village. <br/>
Since we are in disguise it should be fine. The second princess and I are hiding within the straw. <br/>
 <br/>
"Ah......" <br/>
 <br/>
Raphtalia and the villager makes eye contact and there is a mysterious silence. <br/>
 <br/>
"Hero of the shield-sama. It is dangerous here. I recommend you take a detour."  <br/>
 <br/>
We were found out immediately? <br/>
I must reconsider Raphtalia's disguise. <br/>
 <br/>
"Ah, our country has improved a lot thanks to the seed Hero-sama gave us. Thank you." <br/>
 <br/>
Now that I look carefully. This guy is from the neighbouring country. <br/>
Moreover, this guy looks like he's been peddling. <br/>
 <br/>
"I think your disguise will be fine if you add a little more dirt. I only recognized you since she is such a beautiful Raccoon Demi-human. <br/>
 <br/>
This is my fault. As expected, Raphtalia seems to be one of the better looking raccoon demi-humans. <br/>
Or did she become a celebrity when we were peddling? <br/>
In the first place when I bought Raphtalia the slave trader said that the raccoon class's appearance is slightly bad. <br/>
Since they are very wary, they are able to disguise themselves. <br/>
 <br/>
"I'm sorry for everything." <br/>
"Don't even think about it. Compared to what Hero of the Shield-sama has done for us, this much is nothing." <br/>
 <br/>
I give him some silver in exchange for food. <br/>
Our food problem is quite serious due to Firo. <br/>
During our fugitive life-style her stomach rumbled non-stop. <br/>
I'm afraid she'll drop in speed. <br/>
Our only advantages are Firo's speed and disguise ability. <br/>
It is practically our life line against bounty hunters and adventurers on the road. <br/>
 <br/>
"Oh a peddler? I want to buy something....." <br/>
 <br/>
Oh shit! <br/>
A soldier approaches the guy from the neighbouring country. <br/>
 <br/>
"......Hero of the shield-sama?" <br/>
 <br/>
Shit, we've been discovered by a soldier! Just as I was about to order firo to silence him and run- <br/>
 <br/>
"It's me. I co-operated with Hero-sama during the wave." <br/>
 <br/>
Ah now that I look carefully he's one of the volunteer soldiers. <br/>
That reminds me, after parting with trash I couldn't follow up on any of the others that came with me to the castle. <br/>
I was a little worried, but it seems like they're co-operating with us? <br/>
Though at that time I did not know about the story of the Devil of the shield. <br/>
It must have been a considerably hard decision to go through with.  <br/>
They might even have been demoted. <br/>
 <br/>
"......Did you get demoted?" <br/>
"No, for some reason there was no blame." <br/>
"I see, then you're on border patrol without getting demoted?" <br/>
"It's not like that. the majority of the knights are concentrated here." <br/>
 <br/>
Just for me!? <br/>
Hey hey. Just how much does trash hate me? It seems they really don't want me to go to Silt Welt. <br/>
Catching me might not even be their true purpose here though. <br/>
There must be something I don't know concerning the country called Silt Welt. <br/>
It might not impossible to proceed after all. <br/>
My best hand = Whatever the enemy hates. <br/>
I don't know what, but there is certainly something I can exploit here. <br/>
 <br/>
"Anyway, It's dangerous here. Please escape as soon as possible." <br/>
"I am grateful." <br/>
"Don't mention it...... Hero-sama, are you troubled by the fact that we bumped into each other here, and that I recognize you as the Hero of the Shield-sama?" <br/>
 <br/>
......Certainly. <br/>
At the time of the last wave, the other Heroes may have contributed to Glass's withdrawal. <br/>
They may consider my abilities above them but...... <br/>
I would be murdered if we encounter again. <br/>
In any case, we change Raphtalia's clothes for some even worse ones and plaster her face with mud. <br/>
 <br/>
"For the time being let's get out of here." <br/>
"I pray that your suspicions will be cleared up." <br/>
 <br/>
After parting with the villager from the neighbouring country and the volunteer, we headed south to take a detour. <br/>
 <br/>
We had only advanced a little. <br/>
According to the volunteer's story Motoyasu and Itsuki were on their way in a carriage. <br/>
.....I barely steal a glance. <br/>
One of their magicians seems to be chanting something. <br/>
 <br/>
"There! That cart of straw!" <br/>
 <br/>
I seriously hope that was not us. Immediately I have a very bad feeling. <br/>
Motoyasu and Itsuki rush up to our cart. <br/>
Shit! Why are you guys heading here? <br/>
It's probably that bastard that used magic. <br/>
I suppose it's some analysis magic. <br/>
I brush off the straw and jump off the wagon. Firo sensed the situation and returned to her Philo Rial Â· Queen  form. <br/>
 <br/>
"So it was you after all!" <br/>
 <br/>
To they they were so close. Ren also appears. <br/>
Shit...... Can this situation get any worse? <br/>
 <br/>
"We found you! Free princess Melty!" <br/>
 <br/>
Itsuki points at me like he's some messenger of justice and makes a provoking face. <br/>
 <br/>
"Release what, I'm not restraining the second princess." <br/>
"Stop playing dumb, we have evidence!" <br/>
"That's right. You have no justice." <br/>
"Justice......huh?" <br/>
 <br/>
Are the knights acting based on justice during the wave? <br/>
The reality is, everyone has their own sense of justice. <br/>
 <br/>
Wait...... If I think carefully this guy's sense of justice is very straight forward. <br/>
Back in the castle town Ren was worried about the village of plague, while Itsuki just wasted my time on his useless justice impression. <br/>
Can I use this? <br/>
 <br/>
Well, there is no way they will believe me but I might as well try. <br/>
It will still be worth it trying to explain it once and the matter gets settled. <br/>
In other words, If I can turn their sense of justice against each other we may get out of this yet. <br/>
An evil plot is hatched. <br/>
It is one of the situations that game enthusiasts long for. <br/>
If it works this will make them doubt the country...... <br/>
 <br/>
"Are you guys saying that what you believe in is truly justice?" <br/>
"What are you saying?" <br/>
"The second princess is here without any injuries." <br/>
 <br/>
I show the heroes the second princess while maintaining readiness to defend from any attacks. <br/>
The second princess looks at me anxiously, and nods. <br/>
 <br/>
"Hero of the sword-sama, Hero of the spear-sama, Hero of the bow-sama. The Hero of the Shield-sama is innocent. Rather he has saved my life." <br/>
 <br/>
the second princess is not speaking with her usual childish tone, but rather with the authority of an authentic princess. <br/>
The expressions of those 3 visibly change. <br/>
In fact, they are just finding out they were used for evil. <br/>
Since these guys are basically lumps of justice, this will be extraordinarily disgraceful. <br/>
 <br/>
"Please believe me. There is a big conspiracy hidden behind this." <br/>
"But why did princess Melty go to this guy?" <br/>
"I just asked him to protect my life." <br/>
 <br/>
The second princess explains what happened to them. <br/>
 <br/>
"Isn't it unnatural? Who would profit if the Hero of the Shield-sama kidnaps me?" <br/>
"Th-Thats...... <br/>
 <br/>
Are you trying to look for a reason? <br/>
Your eyes are swimming. <br/>
 <br/>
"But, this guy is-" <br/>
"Did the country Merlot Mark not give the Hero of the Sheild-sama different treatment?" <br/>
"Certainly......" <br/>
"In the first place Mother was saying. When the time of misfortune comes, the people must join hands and unite to repel it...... There is no room for Hero-samas to be fighting each other. Please lower your weapons." <br/>
 <br/>
The 3 heroes weaken their grips on their weapons and stood down. <br/>
Though they are still wary. <br/>
They were defeated in the last fight after all. <br/>
As the second princess said, we need to train together and get stronger. <br/>
If we are going to fulfil our missions as Heroes, we cannot just increase our levels. Both our weapons and levels must be sufficient. <br/>
 <br/>
"Do you understand? This is a conspiracy. I will tell you everything that I know. Whether or not you decide to fight will be up to you." <br/>
 <br/>
After I say so the bitch steps forward. <br/>
 <br/>
"Do not listen to the words of the Devil of the shield!" <br/>
 <br/>
Shit! You bitch, I was just about to explain our circumstances. <br/>
What should I say. <br/>
In the first place is she even worried about her younger sister? <br/>
 <br/>
"The latest incident is already solved! the devil of the shield used powerful brainwashing on the second princess!"
