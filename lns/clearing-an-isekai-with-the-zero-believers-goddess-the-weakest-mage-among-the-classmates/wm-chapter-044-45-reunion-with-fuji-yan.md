TLN: SPOOOONSOOORED CHAPTEEERR!! Let’s celebrate with 2 chapters instead!<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Takki-dono and Lucy-dono have not returned even when a day had passed since going to Laberintos.<br/>
"Goshujin-sama, if you are that worried, I will go to Laberintos." (Nina)<br/>
Nina-dono suggests.<br/>
"Hmmm…but there was a report that a dragon appeared in the Upper Floor. Even you, Nina-dono, wouldn’t be able to fight against a dragon alone." (Fujiwara)<br/>
"If it is running away, I can somehow manage." (Nina)<br/>
How vexing.<br/>
Yesterday there was an announcement of a dragon appearing in the Upper Floor, and the Adventurer City grew noisy.<br/>
There were more than tens of people added to the missing people list in just that one day yesterday. <br/>
I was astonished the moment my friends Takki-dono and Lucy-dono were in that list.<br/>
I lost the composure to do any business discussions, so I cancelled all plans for today.<br/>
However, there wasn’t a single sign of my friends returning.<br/>
"Did a dragon appear on the Upper Floor because of the Taboo Dragon?" (Nina)<br/>
"That’s the rumor…" (Fujiwara)<br/>
Something called a Taboo Dragon was born inside Laberintos.<br/>
An evil monster that even dragons avoid.<br/>
It is said that the Great Demon Lord employed these monsters 1,000 years ago.<br/>
Because of that thing, Laberintos’s monsters began acting weird, which is what the adventurers reported.<br/>
"I hope Takki-dono didn’t encounter that dragon." (Fujiwara)<br/>
"I heard that the dragon appeared around the Grand Waterfall. Takatsuki-sama said yesterday that he would be heading to the Grand Waterfall." (Nina)<br/>
"I certainly do remember him saying that…" (Fujiwara)<br/>
Aah, I am worried-desu zo.<br/>
"But Takatsuki-sama is a person that can deal with powerful monsters in a calm fashion. I am sure he is alright!" (Nina)<br/>
"Right. But just waiting around is unnerving." (Fujiwara)<br/>
"Then, let’s go to the guild once mo— Goshujin-sama! I can hear the voice of Takatsuki-sama!" (Nina)<br/>
"What?!" (Fujiwara)<br/>
◇◇<br/>
 -Makoto Pov-<br/>
"Takki-dono!" (Fujiwara)<br/>
Fuji-yan runs towards us.<br/>
"Lucy-sama! You were okay?! Oh? Who is the one there?" (Nina)<br/>
Nina-san’s bright face changed into a sharp gaze.<br/>
Maybe she detected the presence of a monster from Sa-san.<br/>
"She is an otherworldler just like Fuji-yan and I. It is pretty complicated, so can we talk inside?" (Makoto)<br/>
"W-What?! Isn’t that Sasaki-dono?!" (Fujiwara)<br/>
Fuji-yan raised a voice of shock.<br/>
Wow, he noticed in one glance? <br/>
Well, her human mode does have a lot of traces of her previous look after all.<br/>
"Even though Fujiwara-kun noticed immediately, Takatsuki-kun didn’t…" (Aya)<br/>
"Don’t say that." (Makoto)<br/>
I was tired from fighting monsters all night.<br/>
◇◇<br/>
"What… Something like that happened?" (Fujiwara)<br/>
"Sasaki-sama… You’ve had a terrible experience, haven’t you." (Nina)<br/>
Hearing the story of Sa-san, Fuji-yan and Nina-san were in tears.<br/>
They are good people.<br/>
They apparently waited for us the whole time last night.<br/>
Sa-san has changed already.<br/>
It seems like for women’s clothing, there was only the ones of Nina-san, so she was on a tank top and shorts.<br/>
When looking at her in a bright place, her skin is bluish.<br/>
Her hair color is a somewhat purplish black.<br/>
Her face has the traces of Sa-san though.<br/>
How nostalgic.<br/>
"What are you doing staring at Aya?" (Lucy)<br/>
Lucy retorted.<br/>
As if pulled by this, Sa-san turns this way. <br/>
Her dumbfounded face is the same in this world too.<br/>
"So, Sa-san, what are you going to do from now on?" (Makoto)<br/>
Well, don’t even need to ask though.<br/>
"I will be avenging my family." (Aya)<br/>
I could feel a strong resolve from her voice.<br/>
She is stubborn once she decides on something.<br/>
She hasn’t changed since middle school.<br/>
"But doing that all alone is just…" (Nina)<br/>
Nina-san seemed like she wanted to say something as she looked at Fuji-yan.<br/>
Lucy looks at me.<br/>
Help Sasaki Aya<br/>
Don’t help Sasaki Aya ←<br/>
Don’t even need to think about it. Sa-san is an important friend.<br/>
But there’s one point that’s piqued my interest.<br/>
It seems like this RPG Player skill’s options appear at moments when I am about to face dangerous situations.<br/>
In that case, the harpies are strong enemies?<br/>
(You noticed just now?) (Noah)<br/>
I heard the amazed voice of the Goddess.<br/>
Honestly speaking, I thought it was a power that was only for the mood.<br/>
(Goddess-sama, thank you very much. Thanks to your guidance, I was able to reunite with an important friend.) (Makoto)<br/>
(Ara, is that so.) (Noah)<br/>
Saying this to the Goddess, I look at Fuji-yan.<br/>
"Fuji-yan, I will think of a way to conquer this." (Makoto)<br/>
"Fumu, for the sake of that, we would need to gather information." (Fujiwara)<br/>
We both grin.<br/>
That’s my friend for ya. He gets it.<br/>
"Oh my, you are totally into it, Makoto", Lucy says surprised.<br/>
"Of course. Gotta help out a troubled classmate." (Makoto)<br/>
"Thank you, Takatsuki-kun, Fujiwara-kun…" (Aya)<br/>
Even Sa-san is making a face as if she is on the verge of tears.<br/>
"But the harpies seem to be quite the powerful opponents." (Nina)<br/>
Nina-san shows the request poster of the adventurer guild.<br/>
[Laberintos: Mid Floor. <br/>
The Queen of the Harpies and her children. <br/>
Reward; 3,000,000G (Calamity Designation Candidate)]<br/>
"Does this mean it is strong?" (Makoto)<br/>
"Hmm, fighting the whole flock would be more problematic than fighting a Griffon." (Nina)<br/>
"It is stronger than that…" (Lucy)<br/>
Lucy makes a displeased face.<br/>
"It doesn’t matter. If it is just a harpie, I can defeat it in one hit." (Aya)<br/>
Sa-san with her fist tightened feels reliable.<br/>
She has become quite the brawler.<br/>
"By the way, Fuji-yan, is Sa-san really just a normal Lamia?" (Makoto)<br/>
"Eh? What do you mean by that?" (Aya)<br/>
Sa-san turns this way.<br/>
"I think you are quite stronger than the normal Lamia." (Makoto)<br/>
"I was interested in that as well. According to Sasaki-dono’s story, she thought that she died, but she ended up being alive. I feel a mysterious power from that. Let’s use this." (Fujiwara)<br/>
What Fuji-yan was holding was a Soul Book.<br/>
"Aren’t those supposed to be given by the Church or you can’t get them?" (Makoto)<br/>
Or more like, you can’t purchase them unless you are from the Church.<br/>
"Fufufu, there’s a lot of routes. Go ahead, Sasaki-dono. Please hold this book." (Fujiwara)<br/>
"Okay. What is this?" (Aya)<br/>
"With this, we can tell the Status of Sa-san." (Makoto)<br/>
While I was saying this, the Soul Book released light.<br/>
It looks like her Status and Skills have been identified.<br/>
"Hm? How do you look at it?" (Aya)<br/>
"Lend it here." (Makoto)<br/>
I borrowed the book of Sa-san and we all looked at it.<br/>
[Race: Lamia<br/>
Name: Sasaki Aya<br/>
Level: 34<br/>
Stats: XXXXXX<br/>
Skills: XXXXXX]<br/>
"Your level is above 30?!" (Makoto)<br/>
"Uwa! What’s this? Her Stats are crazy high too." (Lucy)<br/>
"I lose to this…" (Nina)<br/>
Nina-san is shocked by this.<br/>
"Does that mean Sa-san has also gotten the Isekai benefit?" (Makoto)<br/>
"Is this impressive?" (Aya)<br/>
Sa-san tilted her head.<br/>
"Her Stats are crazy, but her skills are also interesting-desu zo." (Fujiwara)<br/>
"Uhm, Unique Skills: [Transformation Skill] and [Evolution Skill] and…oh?" (Makoto)<br/>
That last skill…<br/>
"Hm? This is…" (Lucy)<br/>
Looks like Lucy noticed too.<br/>
It said [Action Game Player]. <br/>
<br/>
Chapter 45: The Skill of Sasaki Aya is Strong<br/>
<br/>
"Action Game Player?" (Makoto)<br/>
"It resembles the name of your skill, Makoto." (Lucy)<br/>
"The name of Goshujin-sama’s skill too." (Nina)<br/>
"Let’s see here. Let’s look at it in more detail." (Fujiwara)<br/>
Fuji-yan looks at the Soul Book of Sa-san.<br/>
"Can use the basic actions: [Dash], [Charge Attack], [Mid-Air Jump]… Sasaki-dono, can you?" (Fujiwara)<br/>
"Uhm, there’s definitely times when my running speed increases suddenly. So that was a skill, huh." (Aya)<br/>
"Dash increases the regular speed to 3 times as fast?!" (Makoto)<br/>
"With the stats of Sasaki-sama, 3 times more is quite the strong skill." (Nina)<br/>
That’s nice.<br/>
DIfferent from me, hers sound simple and easy to use.<br/>
"Sa-san, you got quite the jackpot there." (Makoto)<br/>
"Hmm, is that so…" (Aya)<br/>
She is making a face as if she doesn’t really feel it.<br/>
"No, the most crazy part about this skill is here-desu zo." (Fujiwara)<br/>
Remaining Lives: 4/5 ※Activates when level 30 or higher.<br/>
"This is…" (Makoto)<br/>
By remaining lives, it must mean the remaining lives that you can see in action games?<br/>
That means…this is a cheat skill! <br/>
"Sasaki-dono, we now know the reason why you survived the boss of the harpies." (Fujiwara)<br/>
Fuji-yan says this while sighing.<br/>
"Eh? What skill is this?" (Lucy)<br/>
"Goshujin-sama, please explain." (Nina)<br/>
"Hey, Takatsuki-kun, what does this mean?" (Aya)<br/>
"No, Sa-san, at least you should know!" (Makoto)<br/>
If you are a gamer, you should understand.<br/>
"Remaining Lives is a word that’s used in our world. It means that you can redo the number of times it is said there-desu zo." (Fujiwara)<br/>
"Redo?" (Lucy)<br/>
Lucy still isn’t picking it.<br/>
"By Remaining Lives: 5, it must mean that she can most likely revive 5 times at most." (Makoto)<br/>
"Aah, so that’s why it has gone down to 4." (Aya)<br/>
Looks like Sa-san has understood now.<br/>
But Lucy and Nina-san were in shock.<br/>
"R-Revive?" (Lucy)<br/>
"In other words, it has the same effect as the Light Saint Rank Magic: [Resurrection]?" (Nina)<br/>
"Well…most likely." (Makoto)<br/>
""HIEEEEEEE?!""<br/>
It seems like Lucy and Nina-san finally understood.<br/>
"You would need several hundreds of thousands of G if you were to request for a resurrection from the Church…" (Lucy)<br/>
"Being able to resurrect yourself is already in a sacred treasure class…" (Nina)<br/>
The skills of our classmates really are cheats.<br/>
"Now that we understand the cheat-like strength and Skills of Sa-san, let’s rest for now. I am already at my limit in sleepiness." (Makoto)<br/>
"Yeah, I am woozy." (Lucy)<br/>
"Right. Let’s rest first before making a plan." (Fujiwara)<br/>
Lucy and I fell asleep as if we had dropped dead.<br/>
◇◇<br/>
"Now then, let’s form a plan to defeat the Harpy Queen." (Makoto)<br/>
"Alright!" (Aya)<br/>
Sa-san is pumped up.<br/>
The remaining ones are clapping.<br/>
"First, let’s share information. While Takki-dono and Lucy-dono were sleeping, we went to the Adventurer Guild to report that you two have returned." (Fujiwara)<br/>
"Ah, forgot to report." (Makoto)<br/>
That’s Fuji-yan for ya.<br/>
His consideration is polished.<br/>
"While at it, we gathered information regarding the unsavory adventurers that tailed you two at Laberintos." (Nina)<br/>
"It looks like they haven’t returned yet." (Fujiwara)<br/>
"That means…" (Makoto)<br/>
They couldn’t escape from the dragon?<br/>
"They were bad people, so that’s obvious!" (Lucy)<br/>
"It hurts my heart a bit, but it means that there’s no need to worry about being attacked by them in the future, so I suppose that will give me peace of mind." (Makoto)<br/>
I give my thanks to Fuji-yan and Nina-san.<br/>
"Next is Sasaki-dono." (Fujiwara)<br/>
"Me?" (Aya)<br/>
Sa-san still had energy even when coming out from Laberintos, so she went shopping for clothes with Nina-san.<br/>
She is currently wearing a one piece.<br/>
"This here is an Adventurer Card-desu zo." (Fujiwara)<br/>
"Eh? You can get those even outside from the Adventurer Guild?" (Makoto)<br/>
There’s no way that’s possible.<br/>
An Adventurer Card can’t be issued anywhere aside from the Adventurer Guild, and anywhere else aside from the Adventurer Guild is against the law.<br/>
But we are talking about Fuji-yan here.<br/>
He must have some back routes.<br/>
The wry smile of Fuji-yan is testament to this.<br/>
"Uhm, name’s Sasaki Aya, and…race is Demi-human?" (Aya)<br/>
"If we do this the regular way, the fact that she is a monster will be discovered after all." (Fujiwara)<br/>
"Aah, that’s true." (Lucy)<br/>
Lucy nods.<br/>
"Is it bad to learn that she is a monster?" (Makoto)<br/>
"Takatsuki-sama…" (Nina)<br/>
Nina-san looks at me with an amazed face.<br/>
"Monsters and demons can’t be issued an adventurer card. They are subjugation targets in this world of humans after all." (Nina)<br/>
"Is that so." (Makoto)<br/>
Hm?<br/>
Then what about Lucy?<br/>
When I glanced at Lucy, our eyes met.<br/>
And then she averted her gaze.<br/>
(If I remember correctly, Lucy said she is a half elf and demon.) (Makoto)<br/>
Her adventurer card only said elf.<br/>
She must have used a back route.<br/>
"Then, I just have to hide the fact that I’m a Lamia, right?" (Aya)<br/>
"Yes. Your skin is bluish, Sasaki-sama, so it should be fine to answer that you are a fishkin if you are asked what race you are. There’s rarely any unless you are in the southern region, so there’s no need to worry." (Nina)<br/>
As expected of Fuji-yan and Nina-san.<br/>
They thought a lot about it and made preemptive moves.<br/>
"So, the main topic." (Fujiwara)<br/>
Fuji-yan spreads the harpy request poster and other papers.<br/>
"The weak point of harpies is fire magic?" (Aya)<br/>
"Well, their feathers burn well after all. We are counting on you, Lucy." (Makoto)<br/>
"Yeah, leave it to me!" (Lucy)<br/>
Lucy rotates her arm.<br/>
Fire magic really is handy against monsters. <br/>
"How many harpies are there?" (Nina)<br/>
"The family of Lamias was around a 100, so they are probably around the same." (Aya)<br/>
Sa-san answers the question of Nina-san.<br/>
"It would be best to avoid fighting that amount of monsters." (Fujiwara)<br/>
"Can’t we wipe them all out with a surprise attack when they are all gathered together?" (Aya) <br/>
"With the fire magic of Lucy-sama, if it goes well…" (Nina)<br/>
"It is better to not rely too much on the no-control magic of Lucy." (Makoto)<br/>
"Wa?! Makoto!" (Lucy)<br/>
Lucy grabs my arm and shakes it.<br/>
"Hey, your water magic was amazing too, Takatsuki-kun." (Aya)<br/>
Sa-san who is at my other side is slapping my shoulder.<br/>
By the way, I am in between Lucy and Sa-san in the seatings.<br/>
"Water magic isn’t suited for attacks. The Water Dragon magic that I used at the time when we were surrounded by monsters only blew the monsters away. It didn’t defeat them. There might have been some who drowned though." (Makoto)<br/>
"Water Magic: Water Dragon?! Isn’t that a Superior Rank spell?!" (Nina)<br/>
Nina-san raises a voice of surprise.<br/>
"I asked the Spirits to help me use it. It is not like I can use it." (Makoto)<br/>
"Even so, that’s impressive." (Fujiwara)<br/>
"Yeah, Takatsuki-kun was amazing." (Aya)<br/>
Sa-san says this while sticking to me.<br/>
"I will do the attacking. The problem is where the harpy boss will be." (Lucy)<br/>
Even Lucy grabbed my arm and stuck to me.<br/>
Lucy’s body temperature is high so it is hot here.<br/>
"I think they have a lair somewhere just like the Lamias." (Aya)<br/>
Sa-san sticks even closer and closer to me.<br/>
I don’t know if it is the trait of Lamias, but her skin is cool.<br/>
The complete opposite of Lucy.<br/>
Or more like, stuck in between these two is incredibly tight…<br/>
Cramped.<br/>
"Hmm, we tried asking around the Adventurer Guild, but there was no information regarding the harpy’s nest." (Nina)<br/>
"There’s no choice but to search for it on our own, huh…" (Makoto)<br/>
"Then, let’s divide in two groups today. Sa-san and I will explore Laberintos. Fuji-yan, I am sorry, but can you accompany Lucy? Lucy, I am counting on you to ask around the Adventurer City with Nina-san and Fuji-yan." (Makoto)<br/>
"Eh?! Why? I will go to Laberintos too." (Lucy)<br/>
Lucy objects.<br/>
"Lucy-sama, Laberintos is in a state where it isn’t strange to encounter a dragon anywhere. Exploring is dangerous." (Nina)<br/>
"Uh, that’s true… But in that case, Makoto would be in danger too!" (Lucy)<br/>
"As long as I have water around, I can manage to escape. Also, I have to meet the Water Spirits every day in order to use Spirit Magic." (Makoto)<br/>
"Is that so. That sounds cumbersome." (Fujiwara)<br/>
"Thanks to that, I can use Superior Rank Magic." (Makoto)<br/>
"I just have to guide Takatsuki-kun in the dungeon, right?", Sa-san says.<br/>
"Yes, and while at it, let’s train your skills. It would be best if you were to learn Stealth." (Makoto)<br/>
"Got it. Takatsuki-kun, you look like you are having fun." (Aya)<br/>
"Eh?" (Makoto)<br/>
Really?<br/>
But it is true that this situation of preparing before defeating a boss is a first and it is exciting.<br/>
"Sorry, Sa-san. I have to go about it more seriously." (Makoto)<br/>
"No, I was at a loss on my own. It is nice to have everyone help me out." (Aya)<br/>
Saying this, the expression of Sa-san softens compared to yesterday.<br/>
"Hey, Makoto. Don’t do anything weird just because you two are alone, okay?" (Lucy)<br/>
"What do you mean by weird…" (Makoto)<br/>
Lucy pinches my cheek and I brush it off lightly with my hand.<br/>
"You are training with me at night." (Lucy)<br/>
"Of course. Your fire magic is going to be the core of this time’s plan after all." (Makoto)<br/>
"Yes!" (Lucy)<br/>
Now then, it has mostly been decided.<br/>
"Alright then, let’s begin moving." (Makoto)<br/>
