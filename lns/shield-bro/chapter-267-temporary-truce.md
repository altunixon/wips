Chapter 267: Temporary Truce<br/>
"Just give it up already, you people." (Naofumi)<br/>
"Right, Sadina-neesan, cease this nonsense!" (Raphtalia)<br/>
"Don’t be so stiff, Naofumi-chan." (Sadina)<br/>
It’s been three days. Through Raphtalia and Fohl’s actions, we have been able to put a complete stop to Atlas and Sadina’s night operations.<br/>
Raphtalia’s high level worked in our favor.<br/>
Then, while we were casually eating lunch, Sadina happily approaches us.<br/>
"So, Naofumi-chan. Tonight, won’t you come to my place to drink with Raphtalia-chan?" (Sadina)<br/>
"No." (Naofumi)<br/>
She’s probably trying to get Raphtalia drunk to get her out of the competition.<br/>
"Don’t worry. I won’t bring Atlas-chan with me this time. I just want to talk with Naofumi-chan." (Sadina)<br/>
"And you’re expecting me to believe that?" (Naofumi)<br/>
"Then, I’ll work with Fohl-chan to make sure Atlas-chan doesn’t come, so join me. This Onee-san keeps her promises." (Sadina)<br/>
"I remember Onee-san breaking quite an important one." (Raphtalia)<br/>
Raphtalia smiles as she begins releasing bloodlust.<br/>
She’s quite mad.<br/>
Yep, Raphtalia is a child who shows her anger like this.<br/>
"But Raphtalia-chan, until you returned, I made sure to keep Atlas-chan out of Naofumi-chan’s bed. I never heard anything about keeping the other children out." (Sadina)<br/>
"Uu…" (Raphtalia)<br/>
She’s getting into the technical details…<br/>
And I think I’ve heard sophism like this before.<br/>
Ah, right, it came from me.<br/>
I’ve begun to understand Sadina’s personality.<br/>
She acts lazy to prevent others from getting a hold of her, but underneath that, she easily obsesses over things.<br/>
To summarize, she’s someone you can’t let your guard down around.<br/>
She’s really capable, and her fighting power is quite something…<br/>
She denied the Granny’s training, saying it was unnecessary.<br/>
Though that very Granny said that she was one who could master fighting by instinct, so there was no real need.<br/>
I’ve also heard from Raphtalia.<br/>
Apparently, she uses lightning magic on herself to forcefully increase her own reaction speed to levels around Musou Kassei.<br/>
She can cast self-buffing magic and has plenty of ways to raise her own parameters.<br/>
What’s more, she can use echolocation to read movements, so illusion magic isn’t very effective on her.<br/>
Just how skillful is she?<br/>
But if I think about it, she’s supposed to be of a race stronger than the Hakuko when in the water.<br/>
That seems right on the mark. Her appearance definitely fits an aquatic Demi-Human.<br/>
"And Atlas-chan is a little different from the other children in that aspect." (Sadina)<br/>
"Is that so? Well, I just let the others into my bed as an Atlas Countermeasure, you know." (Naofumi)<br/>
When I’m alone, I’m paranoid of the moment Atlas enters.<br/>
Especially on the days when Sadina is away.<br/>
"It’s because Naofumi-chan is a dense mutherfucker." (Sadina)<br/>
(TL: The original text says dense. I have taken a bit of liberty here…)<br/>
(ED: ….lol)<br/>
"Is this about love? I don’t have any interest, and Raphtalia is strict on public morals. I just don’t want to cause an unneeded conflict." (Naofumi)<br/>
I’m no harem-making protagonist.<br/>
If a man didn’t realize anything from Atlas’s persistent approach, they wouldn’t just be dense. They would have transcended density.<br/>
"Ara?" (Sadina)<br/>
"And I’ve been saying this for a while, but once the wave has been dealt with, and the world is at peace, I plan on returning to my own world. I have no intentions of making a family here." (Naofumi)<br/>
"Hah…" (Raphtalia)<br/>
Raphtalia lets out a deep sigh.<br/>
Whenever this topic comes up, she always does that.<br/>
But these guys only ever talk about things like this, so perhaps Raphtalia is just tired of it.<br/>
"Then, Naofumi-chan." (Sadina)<br/>
"What?" (Naofumi)<br/>
"After the world is at peace, and you’re ready to return, make sure to leave after you give love to all the ones who want to hold you close." (Sadina)<br/>
"Listen to what I’m saying!" (Naofumi)<br/>
What is this whale woman saying!?<br/>
"Ara? This Onee-san doesn’t recall saying anything strange. Even when Naofumi-chan isn’t here, I think there are definitely some who wish to carry your child. Like me." (Sadina)<br/>
"Like hell there are!" (Naofumi)<br/>
I think the Queen said something similar.<br/>
Something about marrying Melty.<br/>
If Melty married me, the fact that they had a hero in the family may increase the country’s authority, but I won’t let it end that way.<br/>
That strong-willed Melty probably won’t want relations with anyone besides Firo.<br/>
And wait, to obtain status from having a hero’s child, how calculating are these people?<br/>
"Ah, Naofumi-chan. I’m not sure what you’re misunderstanding, but Onee-san doesn’t want to become famous or have the child of a hero or anything." (Sadina)<br/>
"I wonder." (Naofumi)<br/>
"Onee-san… wants mutual love with the strong drinker, Naofumi-chan. Oh my, what am I saying?" (Sadina)<br/>
Annoying!<br/>
Raphtalia’s bloodlust becomes stronger.<br/>
Their nightly battles may come to a conclusion here.<br/>
Should I assist in silencing this whale?<br/>
"Anyways, Onee-san wants time to talk to you tonight." (Sadina)<br/>
"Here is no good?" (Naofumi)<br/>
"Yeah, it’s a secret matter. Here is a bit…" (Sadina)<br/>
Sadina looks towards an area that seems devoid of people.<br/>
… Is there something there?<br/>
Is that where Shadow’s hiding?<br/>
I don’t see Shadow often, but she seems to be monitoring me.<br/>
She has the ability to disguise herself as the slaves in the village apparently.<br/>
I don’t really care, because she helps out too, though.<br/>
"So come to the secret base with Raphtalia-chan tonight. If you do so, I promise I won’t come to your room with Atlas-chan again." (Sadina)<br/>
"Ah, yes, yes." (Naofumi)<br/>
She’s quite a stubborn person. Though, she’ll probably fold at some point.<br/>
"It’s a promise." (Sadina)<br/>
Sadina says this as she departs.<br/>
"I wonder what that was about." (Raphtalia)<br/>
"Who knows?" (Naofumi)<br/>
That drunkard’s objective is as of yet unknown.<br/>
Starting with my village, Firo, and the people in the other village, she seems to garner great respect from all of them.<br/>
But, I can only see her as a loose person who likes to play around.<br/>
Though when the time comes, she does perform well.<br/>
Apparently, she does a lot of other things as well, but I haven’t seen anything.<br/>
I’ve seen her speaking with Melty as well. The princess wouldn’t tell me what it was about.<br/>
Even when Firo went into question mode, she continued to reply, ‘It’s a secret.’<br/>
Forcing it out of her wasn’t necessary, so I ignored it.<br/>
But where is this charisma coming from?<br/>
Anyways, that night.<br/>
Sadina had tied Atlas up and brought her to my place.<br/>
"Now, Fohl-chan. Atlas-chan. I’m going to be heading out with Naofumi-chan." (Sadina)<br/>
She… actually did it.<br/>
"Sadina-san. Is this betrayal? Is that what it is?" (Atlas)<br/>
Atlas is bewildered as she presses Sadina for an answer.<br/>
Was she suddenly assaulted without warning?<br/>
"Tonight’s a temporary truce. Just calm down and leave it to Onee-san. Atlas-chan should just sleep with Fohl-chan today." (Sadina)<br/>
"Ah… Naofumi-sama, please save me!" (Atlas)<br/>
"Sadina, don’t betray those who believe in you as a joke. That’s the thing I hate most in this world. If you go too far, I’m kicking you out." (Naofumi)<br/>
It’s probably a simple joke, but whenever I see someone deceive someone else, I get a strong sense of discomfort.<br/>
But Witch’s already gone.<br/>
… I have to forget her.<br/>
"Yes, yes~. Then, I’ll be deceiving Naofumi-chan only once more after this~" (Sadina)<br/>
"Declaring it beforehand doesn’t solve the problem." (Naofumi)<br/>
As we were talking, Fohl picks Atlas up in a princess cradle. He has on quite a happy expression.<br/>
"Now, Atlas. Today, you’re going to be sleeping peacefully. It’s too early for you to be doing things like this." (Fohl)<br/>
His face and build are naturally good, so he looks like some sort of prince.<br/>
No, by blood, he is a prince.<br/>
Not that that matters.<br/>
Anyways, he’s carrying the young body of Atlas, which refuses to grow any older. The scene gives off an elegant feeling like one found in Shoujo Manga.<br/>
"Uu… Onii-sama, I won’t forget this disgrace. I’ll hold a grudge." (Atlas)<br/>
Atlas complains as Fohl carries her off.<br/>
Wouldn’t it be best to keep her tied up like that forever?<br/>
Am I scum for thinking that? Yep, I am.<br/>
I evaluate myself as I turn towards Sadina.<br/>
"Will you get on Onee-san and we’ll swim there? Or will you ask Gaelion-chan to take you?" (Sadina)<br/>
"I guess Gaelion would be fine." (Naofumi)<br/>
If anything happens, I can use Gaelion to buy time for my escape.<br/>
Like that, we ride Gaelion to Sadina’s secret Island Base.<br/>
