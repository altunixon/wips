<br/>
I didn’t want to interfere with normal translation, so I started the side stories, but I found that not only does it happen after the main story, I contains so many unintroduced characters that I have no Idea what is going on. The gender of these people is also pretty ambiguous as they are speaking in a gender-neutral manner. I have a slight suspicion that Atlas is a girl.<br/>
Oh Well, here goes<br/>
THE CHRISTMAS OF THE SHIELD HERO PART 1<br/>
"Achoo!"<br/>
On that day, I had just finished my job and was in the middle of returning to the village.<br/>
It’s also fine to return through the portal, but the moment I reached the village I had work to do<br/>
It seems that I can only rest when riding the carriage.<br/>
It’s been about half a year since the end of the last of the waves<br/>
I look to the sky and see it covered in thick clouds.<br/>
The temperature is dropping by the day, and it seems that even colder days are coming.<br/>
My breath has also turned white<br/>
So Melromark also has four seasons.<br/>
It seems the climate had been in disarray during the wave.<br/>
"Ah… " (Naofumi)<br/>
"What’s wrong?" (Raphtalia)<br/>
Raphtalia asks me from outside the carriage.<br/>
I hold up my hand, and look to the sky in silence.<br/>
"Ah…" (Naofumi)<br/>
Raphtalia follows my lead and stares at the sky.<br/>
"It’s snowing." (Raphtalia)<br/>
"So it falls in Melromark too." (Naofumi)<br/>
"The summer is hot, and the winter gets this cold." (Naofumi)<br/>
It’s not like we’re in the tropics, but the summer was still pretty hot.<br/>
But the winter gets cold enough for it to snow.<br/>
"Naofumi, do you hate the cold?" (Raphtalia)<br/>
"I don’t hate it, I just thought it would be a pain to put spikes on the carriage’s wheels." (Naofumi)<br/>
"…. Should the hero who became an archduke and saved the world be saying such things?" (Raphtalia)<br/>
Raphtalia words are correct<br/>
But when I think of the money and labor wasted, it still seems like a pain.<br/>
"It seems that you are still trying to increase our wealth, but what do you plan to use it for?" (Raphtalia)<br/>
"Nothing in particular, if I were to use it, it would go towards decreasing the aftereffects of the wave" (Naofumi)<br/>
And it never hurts to have extra<br/>
My experiences till now have made saving money a habit deeply rooted in my psych.<br/>
Well, this habit had helped us out quite a bit.<br/>
But as an Archduke, I was granted a large sum of wealth and an estate.<br/>
"And having money is better than not having it." (Naofumi)<br/>
"As expected of Naofumi" (Atlas)<br/>
Atlas left the shield and floated in the winter sky<br/>
What do you mean by ‘as expected’.<br/>
Well then, half a year has passed since the wave, but even now, it’s effects are still clear<br/>
Melromark’s castle town still has the mountain of the Spirit Turtle occupying much of the town, and the casualties of the countries that had the dragon’s hourglasses was very high.<br/>
Though we may have achieved peace, the everyday lives of the civilians is still harsh.<br/>
There’s no way that reconstruction could have finished in a mere half-year.<br/>
That’s why our current job is to go around the world and sell supplies to the troubled populace, while helping the unfortunate.<br/>
Well, we are gaining a small profit from this enterprise…<br/>
As expected, this job is quite tiring and in order to take a well-deserved break, we are proceeding towards the village at a leisurely rate.<br/>
Well, I did return to the village by portal yesterday.<br/>
"Don’t worry about it. The snow’s picking up, isn’t it?" (Naofumi)<br/>
"KUE!" (Filo Rial)<br/>
Oh, by the way, the bird pulling the carriage right now isn’t Firo, but her number one follower Piyo.<br/>
Firo is currently travelling the world with Melty, so she got Piyo to pull the cart for us.<br/>
Piyo is staring intently at the falling snowflakes while walking.<br/>
"It sure is." (Raphtalia)<br/>
"How much snow does Melromark usually get?" (Naofumi)<br/>
No matter how many meters of snow cover we get, it will still be troublesome<br/>
We may even be troubled further by winter-specific monsters.<br/>
"It depends on the year, but every year we get enough to dye the landscape white" (Raphtalia)<br/>
"Fumu…" (Naofumi)<br/>
Based on Raphtalia, we will be getting quite a bit of snow.<br/>
Well, we don’t have to be that worried…<br/>
We survived fighting that bitch goddess. We should be fine whatever comes our way.<br/>
"Anyways, the cold-resistant goods we prepared seem to be working fine." (Naofumi)<br/>
"You’re right… By the way, Naofumi, do you need anything?" (Raphtalia)<br/>
"Hm?"<br/>
Both me and Raphtalia have learned to use the power of gods… no let’s call them spirits… to some extent<br/>
But in order to use it, we must offer our own power to them.<br/>
Anyways, we both gave up a majority of our godly powers, so we were pretty much indistinguishable from humans.<br/>
Well, we could use them to some extent…<br/>
We became a somewhat half-assed existence and we were still affected by the heat and the cold. All’s well with the world.<br/>
Anyways, the armor I had equipped was quite useful, as it was temperature resistant.<br/>
"I’m not cold at all" (Atlas)<br/>
"Well that’s because you’re… By the way, Atlas, this conversation isn’t getting anywhere, can you please be quiet."<br/>
Atlas was always like this. She would always interrupt the conversation and take it in a weird direction.<br/>
You’re not cold because you became a spirit.<br/>
"I’ll have to make sure no one in the village catches a cold." (Naofumi)<br/>
"Yeah, it seems that Kiel would run around, even in this weather." (Raphtalia)<br/>
Would the Loin-clothed dog be circling the village in joy now?<br/>
"She seems like the type that would get excited in snow." (Naofumi)<br/>
Yes, is seems she would be the type to roll around in the snow.<br/>
Even though she is the hero of the Scythe, you know.<br/>
"KUE!" (Piyo)<br/>
Piyo cried out.<br/>
We could see the village that was our destination.<br/>
We had finally arrived huh…<br/>
"Niichan, Niichan! It’s Snow! It’s snowing!" (Kiel)<br/>
Kiel, who had been excitedly running around the village ran in front of me.<br/>
I get off the Carriage and start towards the Village.<br/>
There doesn’t seem to be any noticeable change.<br/>
The Bioplant forest seems to be strong against the cold, and some tomato-esque fruits are growing<br/>
And, as expected, Kiel is extremely excited.<br/>
What a simple fellow.<br/>
"Yes, yes, it’s snowing" (Naofumi)<br/>
What about it?<br/>
Is what I wanted to say, but dealing with her would be a pain.<br/>
And the happy feeling derived from snow was something that I could kinda understand.<br/>
But seeing my home covered in snow gave off a slight melancholical feeling.<br/>
"Welcome back, Hero of the Shield" (Imya)<br/>
"I’m Back" (Naofumi)<br/>
Imya, who had been chasing Kiel, arrived<br/>
As always, these two seem to come as a set.<br/>
Oh yeah, that’s right.<br/>
"Imya" (Naofumi)<br/>
"Yes" (Imya)<br/>
"It’s getting cold, so could you start making some cold-resistant gear?" (Naofumi)<br/>
"I’ve already made enough for the villagers, do you want more?" (Imya)<br/>
How considerate.<br/>
To be ready even before I asked.<br/>
"If you find any free time, could you make some more?" (Naofumi)<br/>
"Leave it to me" (Imya)<br/>
I praise Imya and pat her head, then I start cooking.<br/>
Today will be cold, so I’ll cook something warm<br/>
"Oh yeah, Niichan!" (Kiel)<br/>
"What is it Kiel, you’re not running around in circles any more." (Naofumi)<br/>
"What do you take me for… never mind… Anyways, it’s almost Christmas right? What will you ask Santa Claus for?" (Kiel)<br/>
"Well you are a dog… Wait, Christmas?"<br/>
Are you meaning to tell me that an alternate world also has Christmas?<br/>
"There is a Christmas here?" (Naofumi)<br/>
I’ll ask Raphtalia later.<br/>
As it’s Kiel, she may have just heard it from the other heroes.<br/>
…<br/>
"Of course there’s a Christmas." (Raphtalia)<br/>
My question was reflected quite smoothly.<br/>
Fumu…<br/>
"Originally, it was a tradition spread by the former heroes. Melty told me about it." (Raphtalia)<br/>
"To see this Christian holy festival in another world…" (Naofumi)<br/>
"Holy Festival?" (Raphtalia)<br/>
What?<br/>
Isn’t Christmas supposed to celebrate the birth of Christ?<br/>
Wait, the former heroes were Japanese weren’t they<br/>
They may have spread Japanese Christmas customs.<br/>
"What sort of day is Christmas?" (Naofumi)<br/>
"Isn’t Christmas just Christmas?" (Raphtalia)<br/>
I didn’t get anything from that.<br/>
These people simply might not know the origin of the holiday.<br/>
"Do you know anything about this Atlas?" (Naofumi)<br/>
"Oh, the former Heroes simply said that Christmas was a day to give presents, and never explained its purpose." (Atlas)<br/>
The former Hero’s probably wanted an opportunity to celebrate with their party members so they had just given a general outline of the event.<br/>
It doesn’t seem these people care about the birth of a holy man.<br/>
"And, who is this Santa Fellow?" (Naofumi)<br/>
"He gives presents to all the good boys and girls when they are asleep." (Atlas)<br/>
I see. So they only shared the fun parts of Christmas<br/>
They completely left out its religious aspects.<br/>
"That’s how it is! So what do you wish for Niichan?" (Kiel)<br/>
…Kiel’s eyes are shining<br/>
She seems to be having a lot of fun.<br/>
"Do adults receive presents as well?" (Naofumi)<br/>
"Oh right, Niichan was adult" (Kiel)<br/>
"What is that supposed to mean?" (Naofumi)<br/>
Are you trying to tell me that I’m childish (though I won’t deny it).<br/>
"Anyways, Present! It’s going to be fun!" (Kiel)<br/>
Does that mean that I am supposed to give out presents? What am I supposed to do<br/>
In my world, the role of Santa was usually played by the parents…<br/>
"Raphtalia?" (Naofumi)<br/>
"Yes?" (Raphtalia)<br/>
Hmm… The probability that she believes in Santa is quite high.<br/>
I don’t want to break her, or any of the villager’s dreams.<br/>
Ok, just in case, I’ll ask someone who seems knowledgeable on the matter<br/>
I could go ask Trash or the Queen, but they are probably busy.<br/>
Oh well, I guess I’ll have to ask someone else.<br/>
Now who would be knowledgeable on such matters?<br/>
I don’t really want to, but the one who knows the most about the villagers is probably that person.<br/>
"Excuse me, I wish to speak with Sadina." (Naofumi)<br/>
"… Are you alright Naofumi" (Raphtalia)<br/>
"………" (Naofumi)<br/>
Recently, whenever me or Raphtalia approach her, she asks about our relationship. She seems to be faithful to her turn.<br/>
But I am already getting used to that.<br/>
By the way, previously Sadina said,<br/>
"Oneesan, I’ll definitely teach you some techniques."<br/>
Or some other irresponsible thing and slipped away.<br/>
The feeling of fear from being pushed down by her is still embedded in my skull.<br/>
I’m sure she’s still aiming for me or something.<br/>
In a way, she might be a more troublesome person than Atlas.<br/>
For what reason is this person pressuring me to this extent?<br/>
It seems that person would act the same regardless of whether I was the Hero of the Shield, or the world’s savior or not…<br/>
That’s why dealing with her is an Extremely scary task.<br/>
"I’m coming with you." (Atlas)<br/>
"Go away! Raphtalia and Atlas, I don’t need you monitoring us" (Naofumi)<br/>
"Yes. Come Atlas, this way" (Raphtalia)<br/>
Capturing the spirit Atlas was a task that, for now, only Raphtalia and I were capable of.<br/>
And so, I left Atlas to Raphtalia so she would not follow me.<br/>
"Ah. It’s Naofumi" (Imya)<br/>
For the love of…<br/>
Yes, that’s right, it’s like that.<br/>
"Imya, your uncle is calling you."<br/>
I don’t want to deal with Sadina and these two at the same time.<br/>
These idiots don’t act rationally towards other people.<br/>
"I understand" (Imya)<br/>
"Kiel, you…" (Naofumi)<br/>
"What is it Niichan?" (Kiel)<br/>
"Let’s have fun later" (Naofumi)<br/>
"YES!" (Kiel)<br/>
