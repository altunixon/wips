Chapter 4: The Kiba Food Stall in the Post Station Town<br/>
<br/>
1<br/>
I was prepared for my war.<br/>
The pot was filled with ingredients, with a piece of cloth covering it like a lid. The underside of the cloth had fake rubber tree leaves sewn into it for waterproofing, and we even used fuibaha vines to secure the entire pot.<br/>
I used a clean piece of cloth to wrap up the grilled poitan and put the tino and aria into the sack for vegetables.<br/>
I put the wooden spatula for stirring, a small spatula for scooping the ingredients, a chopping board made of krilee wood, two plates and the santoku knife into the same bag.<br/>
The other bag was full of firewood, a small machete and rana grass to start fires.<br/>
I already put the red copper plates used as change, and the white copper plates for Milano Mast into the pouch on my waist.<br/>
Everything was set.<br/>
I cleared the cutleries for dinner early in the morning, forage for herbs and firewood, and cleared all the morning chores. The time was between dawn and noon.<br/>
All there was left was to wait for Vena Wu to reach the Fa house.<br/>
「This day has finally come.」<br/>
Ai Fa said.<br/>
「Yes, it’s finally time.」<br/>
I replied.<br/>
「We have to make it through these ten days first.」<br/>
「Yes, I will do my best.」<br/>
「We will have to live like this for ten consecutive days.」<br/>
「If this kind of life ends after ten days, that means our effort has been wasted.」<br/>
「You will be together with the eldest daughter of the Wu clan for half a day in these ten days.」<br/>
「Huh?」<br/>
「Anyway, work hard.」<br/>
「Yes, I will work hard!」<br/>
「She’s your betrothed after all.」<br/>
「Not at all! There’s no such thing!」<br/>
I turned and look at Ai Fa in shock.<br/>
「W-Why are you bringing this up now? Your expression didn’t change at all when Donda Wu named Vena Wu as my helper right?」<br/>
Ai Fa put her hand on my shoulder nonchalantly.<br/>
「Don’t panic, I’m just kidding.」<br/>
「Ughhh…」<br/>
「Do your job properly, I will do my part too.」<br/>
Ai Fa’s expression remained calm and collected, and there was a gentle light in her eyes.<br/>
「… I will await your safe return.」<br/>
<br/>
Vena Wu arrived on time. We used a krilee stick to carry the iron pot and cross the terrifying cliff, and reached the Post Station Town.<br/>
The first destination was the 《Kimyusu’s tail inn》.<br/>
Milano led us to the back of the inn, and we met with the pushcart that will be battling alongside us for the next ten days.<br/>
That was a mobile pushcart.<br/>
About 2m tall, 1.5m wide and 80cm deep, the structure was made from wood, and a leather sheet covered the roof of the stall. The front and sides were covered with wooden boards, and reach up to my waist. Only the wall on the inside had a door that could be opened.<br/>
I opened the door and find it empty, and the interior walls were covered in clay.<br/>
A charcoal brazier shaped depression was right in the center.[3]<br/>
I needed to start a fire in the brazier and heat up the pot.<br/>
I placed the pot on the wooden board that had a hole in the center, and it fit in snugly.<br/>
There were air holes to the right side of the board to expel the smoke.<br/>
The structure of this pushcart was simple.<br/>
Since it was simple, using it would be a hitch.<br/>
「… Please take care not to damage the pushcart.」<br/>
I gave a friendly nod to Milano Mast who was showing a sour face the first thing in the morning.<br/>
Vena Wu turned her head away nonchalantly.<br/>
「Okay then, follow me.」<br/>
With Milano Mast leading us, we walked on the streets.<br/>
This was the first time I visited the Post Station Town before noon, there was about 30% lesser people on the streets.<br/>
As Vena Wu and I pushed the pushcart forward, countless gazes watched us. Their eyes were filled with confusion and shock, as if they didn’t understand why the denizens from Forest’s Edge were pushing the cart.<br/>
Yellow skinned people.<br/>
The ivory skinned crowd.<br/>
Black skinned men.<br/>
White skin citizens.<br/>
People of all races and creed were staring us.<br/>
A foreigner in Forest’s Edge clothing and a denizen of Forest’s Edge who was like the incarnation of sexiness. Vena Wu and I were the most prominent duo. As we were pushing a cart painstakingly, they couldn’t just ignore us.<br/>
「How annoying… We are more prominent than usual…」<br/>
「It’s fine, this will serve as our advertisement.」<br/>
In that case, news of the "denizens of Forest’s Edge are setting up a stall" would spread through the city. It was fine for them to think of us as a joke, I didn’t mind them being curious or fearful. I just hope that more people would know about us.<br/>
We passed through the lodging zone, and when we reached the marketplace, most of the stalls had already up and running.<br/>
The gazes of the stall owners were also focused on us.<br/>
In the entire Post Station Town, only the Totos Moa were unmoved by us.<br/>
「Hi, so you are really opening a stall here.」<br/>
Uncle Dora who sells vegetables greeted us along the way.<br/>
「That’s right. I will be in your care for this ten days.」<br/>
As Milano Mast didn’t stop, I had to greet him while pushing the cart.<br/>
Uncle Dora’s smile was much more natural. He sent us off with his gaze as we continued north.<br/>
Milano Mast brought us to the furthest fringe of the marketplace.<br/>
In order to set up the marketplace, the Post Station Town cleared a path through the woods. And our stall was in the northernmost end.<br/>
Our stall was on the right side, facing the north.<br/>
If another two or three stalls were added, they would be right at the edge of the woods. They would need to clear more of the forest then. No matter what, our stall was at the extreme corner of the marketplace.<br/>
The pedestrians here were sparse.<br/>
There wasn’t any stall opposite us.<br/>
Our neighbour was an old man with dubious accessories placed on a cloth on the ground. When he saw us, he looked dumbfounded like a child.<br/>
「I already told you these rules yesterday. Take note of these two main points: You can’t tout for customers loudly, and you can only start a fire in the brazier… Also, you must report to me if you see anyone break these rules.」<br/>
「I got it. Thank you for your help.」<br/>
「Hmmp… Next will be the signboard. Hey, what do you want to write on it?」<br/>
「Ehh? Signboard?」<br/>
There was a signboard on the cart, but it was blank. It only had a hieroglyphs or logo at the bottom right corner that says 《Kimyusu’s tail inn》.<br/>
「You have to write down what you are selling on the signboard, or your customers will be clueless. What do you want to write?」<br/>
Milano Mast took down a small leather pouch tied to his waist and opened its strings.<br/>
Inside the pouch was a gooey green fluid, and a small stick. The fluid had a stinging smell, a bit like grass. I guess it was a dye made from vegetation.<br/>
「Well then, please… help me write "Kiba".」<br/>
「… I guess so.」<br/>
Milano Mast sighed and started writing a large symbol with his pen and dye.<br/>
The symbol was a combination of ovals and curves and had four curvy lines extending upwards. They bore some resemblance with the tusks and horns of a kiba.<br/>
「It looks great, it feels very kiba.」<br/>
「… You have to push the cart back to the inn every day. I want to check it for damages.」<br/>
「Alright. We are also planning to close the stall before dusk.」<br/>
Milano Mast grunted one last time before leaving.<br/>
The old man was still looking at us with a blank expression from the side.<br/>
「Let’s start with the preparation.」<br/>
I asked Vena Wu to help me undo the pot sealed with fuihaba vines.<br/>
When I took off the lid made from cloth and fake rubber tree leaves, Vena Wu cheered.<br/>
「No wonder I keep smelling the scent of tarapa… is that vegetable stew…?」<br/>
「No, we don’t have the time or the budget. This is just tarapa sauce.」<br/>
As I used two whole tarapa, the pot was sixty percent filled with bright red sauce.<br/>
Tarapa had the sourness of tomato. After I cooked it with diced aria and fruit wine, then season it with salt and pico leaves, the special tarapa sauce was done.<br/>
「I’m starting the fire. Vena Wu, can you help me open that sack?」<br/>
「Okay.」<br/>
After glancing at Vena Wu who nodded in acknowledgement, I started a fire in the brazier with rana grass.<br/>
The sauce was already cold, so I need to start a big fire.<br/>
Considering the size of the brazier and the distance from the brazier to the pot, the fire should be smaller than the one in the makeshift stove used during the wedding. In order to heat the entire pot evenly, I had to use strong fire.<br/>
I brought all the firewood we had over, and they would probably be used up before we close the stall. I would then have to forage for firewood then. That was why I brought a machete along.<br/>
I estimated the operation hours would be five hours.<br/>
We left the house between dawn and noon and planned to head home between noon and dusk. I also had to account for the two hours traveling time.<br/>
According to my biological clock, dawn was six, noon was twelve and dusk was seven. We would open the stall at 10am and close the stall at 3pm in the afternoon.<br/>
「Hmm… Now that I think about it, I find this incredible… I never imagined that I will be peddling merchandize in the Post Station Town, I never dream that this would happen…」<br/>
「I feel the same. But the time we spent in Forest’s Edge are incomparable, so this feeling must be much stronger for you.」<br/>
Maybe Donda Wu sent her to help because he knew that she yearns for the world outside.<br/>
No, if he knew how Vena Wu felt, he would forbid her from going out.<br/>
Anyway, Vena Wu was very cheerful today. Compared to the last time she came with me, she looked much happier.<br/>
「But will this really sell… There are so few people…」<br/>
「This is the edge of the Post Station Town after all.」<br/>
From this stall I could see the people enter the Post Station Town from the north, and those who are leaving the Post Station Town and heading north. There was barely anyone who came all the way here to buy goods.<br/>
「This is our first day, so we can take it easy. The goal for this two days is to let everyone know that we exist.」<br/>
The news of denizens from Forest’s Edge selling kiba meals in the Post Station Town would definitely spread in the entire city. Over time, there would be curious people here to check us out. In the first few days of our stall opening, we had to grasp these customer source tightly.<br/>
The tarapa was starting to bubble, so I used the spatula Vena Wu handed me to stir the iron pot.<br/>
「Vena Wu, please help me stir the sauce later. There are many hamburg steaks in the sauce, take care not to break them.」<br/>
「Got it… smells nice… it is still daytime, but I’m starting to get hungry…」<br/>
「Ah, if you can still eat, please try one later.」<br/>
When she heard that, Vena Wu’s eyes started to shine.<br/>
「Can I…? Isn’t this merchandize…?」<br/>
「This is the merchandize we are selling, so we will have to try its taste first. I made some extra for taste testing.」<br/>
Vena Wu was squatting by the stall and taking things out from the sack. But she stood up and quietly walked to my side.<br/>
When an ominous feeling appeared in my heart, Vena Wu gripped the excess cloth on my waist tightly and said:<br/>
「I’m so happy… thank you, Asuta…」<br/>
「Y-You’re welcome. This is also part of the job.」<br/>
Vena Wu was very serious during the wedding banquet preparation too, so she wouldn’t take any inappropriate actions during work. In this regard, she really was a model denizen of Forest’s Edge.<br/>
In that case— I could probably get along well with this colleague.<br/>
「Good, it’s heating up. Please help me stir.」<br/>
I placed the black krilee chopping board on the right of the work platform, then placed the tino, aria, plates and santoku knife on top.<br/>
The leaves of the tino overlaps in the shape of a rose and was a vegetable that resembles a lettuce in appearance.<br/>
It had the texture of a cabbage. I plucked a large leaf and chop it to shreds.<br/>
I then cut the aria which had the texture of onions into thin slices.<br/>
After cutting these two vegetables, I moved them onto the plate and mixed them together.<br/>
I then placed the grilled poitan that was wrapped in a cloth onto the working platform, and the preparation was done.<br/>
「Vena Wu, please remember how to make this, it’s not difficult at all.」<br/>
「Ara… What a small poitan…」<br/>
「Yes. I only used half a poitan for each of these grilled poitan.」<br/>
The Wu clan would usually grill two poitan at one time, its diameter was about 30cm.<br/>
The grilled poitan here only used a quarter of that amount and was about 14 to 15cm wide.<br/>
I added gigo, so the grilled poitan was fluffier, and the thickness was about 1.5cm. It looked as small and cute like a cream coloured muffin.<br/>
「We will first put a layer of tino and aria on the mini poitan. It should be slightly thinner than the poitan. We will then put a hamburg steak on top of it.」<br/>
After I scooped up the hamburg steak soaking inside the pot, Vena Wu gasped in surprise again.<br/>
Normally, the hamburg steak would be moulded into an oval, but this one was circular.<br/>
It was about 180g.<br/>
It was 12cm in diameter, and 3cm thick.<br/>
The hamburg steak was covered in red tarapa sauce. After adding shredded tino on top, I covered it with another poitan.<br/>
The product of this stall "Kiba burger" was complete.<br/>
「Isn’t it simple? Please try it.」<br/>
I took the stirring spatula from Vena Wu and handed her the "Kiba burger".<br/>
「… It looks…」<br/>
「Hmm?」<br/>
「I think, it looks tasty…」<br/>
「It’s delicious, I love hamburgers.」<br/>
「… It’s not dinner, so I don’t need to say grace right…?」<br/>
「I guess? I don’t know either.」<br/>
Vena Wu stood haplessly on the spot, as if she couldn’t bear to eat the hamburger in her hands.<br/>
She then finally made up her mind and opened her lustrous lips— and took a big bite out of the "Kiba burger".<br/>
「Be careful not to spill the fillings. It’s better to hold it sideways.」<br/>
She nodded, then took another big bite.<br/>
The women in Forest’s Edge uses both hands to hold the hamburger. The way they chew with satisfaction looked very adorable. I realized that when I let Ai Fa taste test it.<br/>
Ai Fa was always calm and collected, but she looked very pure and adorable when she eats a burger. It was the same for Vena Wu who was overflowing with sexy charm, they were both equally cute.<br/>
After Vena Wu finished her burger, she lowered her head slightly again, and grabbed my waist band tightly.<br/>
「… This is really delicious…」<br/>
「I-I see. That’s great!」<br/>
Instead of the flirty Vena Wu who squirms her body, her childish actions make her doubly charming<br/>
But there was nothing to gain from analysing that.<br/>
「What are your thoughts? Will it sell?」<br/>
「I don’t know… If the people in town thinks this burger is unpalatable, that means they are not worthy of eating Kiba…」<br/>
Her comments were the same as Ai Fa.<br/>
I think they were exaggerating too much.<br/>
The people in the city thinks that kiba meat was 「tough and smelly」. To wipe away that ill impression, I wanted to use "Kiba burger" as my first weapon. This was a changeup pitch.[4]<br/>
Since there wasn’t any food like hamburger in town, they would be intrigued by it. But if I want the people in the city to understand how tasty kiba meat actually was, I would need to rely on the strength of simple meat dishes like steaks and grills.<br/>
By the way, moulding hamburg steak was very time consuming, and I could carry twenty of them in one pot. If I used another container to transport pre-grilled hamburg steak, and make the balance sauce in the stall, I could stock up to 40 hamburgers. But that was just my first pitch in my attack of the Post Station Town.<br/>
My thinking was very simple, hamburger was the symbol of a light meal. In the Post Station Town, the Kimyusu meat bun and other light meals consist of meat, vegetables and carbohydrates, so I decided to follow this model.<br/>
Tarapa has a strong fragrance. As we couldn’t tout for customers loudly, the 「fragrance」 was exceptionally important. The tarapa sauce made from tarapa, fruit wine and the aria to enhance its flavour had an alluring aroma, which would definitely stimulate the appetite of any passers-by.<br/>
When the "Kiba burger" attracts enough customers to visit, I will upgrade my menu— and sell food that was less tedious to prepare, and slowly share the deliciousness of kiba meat with the residents of the Post Station Town.<br/>
These ten days would decide the progress of the next step.<br/>
If I could sell 20 to 30 portions before the final day, I will push out a new menu for the next ten days, which would be a great sales record.<br/>
Today was the opening day. To save on ingredient cost, I only prepared ten burgers. I would be satisfied if I sold all of them.<br/>
「Alright, we are starting our battle soon!」<br/>
The instant I announced that—<br/>
With a donk, something hit the roof.<br/>
And as if a hole had opened in the sky, rain poured down suddenly.<br/>
「Hya.」<br/>
Vena Wu yelped without any tension, then swiftly carried the sack with our goods under the roof.<br/>
This was a sudden downpour commonly seen in Forest’s Edge.<br/>
As Forest’s Edge was just an hour away, the weather was very similar.<br/>
However—<br/>
When the sudden rain stopped without any warning, even the sparse pedestrian before us were gone.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
2<br/>
「I see!」<br/>
That was all I could say.<br/>
The people in the city was used to sudden downpour like this, some of them dash across the streets, while others hid under the trees to minimize their losses.<br/>
The old man selling accessories beside us picked up the cloth with his wares in a flash, then escaped into the woods behind him. His reaction and nimble feat was amazing.<br/>
After the rain stop, everyone came out onto the streets haplessly— the northern side where we were located was deserted.<br/>
I looked to the left of the stall, and the southern streets had already reverted to its crowded state before the rain.<br/>
As very few people would come here to buy things, everyone had already moved on to other places, and the place turned desolated.<br/>
「… All the pedestrians are gone…」<br/>
「It can’t be helped, this is natural disaster. The crucial timing is the period right after noon, so let’s rest up for now.」<br/>
Thanks to Vena Wu’s quick reactions, the firewood didn’t get wet. The rain was also kept out of the pot. We had not run into unsalvageable accidents yet, so we could only accept this fact graciously.<br/>
「… So, we will just stand here until the afternoon crowd shows up…?」<br/>
「Yes. Waiting is also part of our job.」<br/>
「… I’m sorry that you are paying so much salary…」<br/>
「Don’t mind that. Carrying the goods, stirring the sauce, replenishing firewood, I can’t do all that alone. Our work is just beginning.」<br/>
However, there was still two more hours before noon.<br/>
In these two hours, we could only watch the fire with a hollow feeling.<br/>
I could use this chance to gather firewood, but the rain just stopped, so that was useless. The dripping wet branches would dry in an hour or two, so we decided to settle this chore later.<br/>
Which meant we had nothing to do.<br/>
「Ehh… Let’s chat?」<br/>
「Alright…」<br/>
「Vena Wu, which one of your family are you closest too?」<br/>
「… Do you think that is an interesting topic…?」<br/>
「I think it’s rather interesting.」<br/>
Vena Wu sighed softly, then fiddled with her brown hair.<br/>
「I get along with Rimee and Ludo the best… I feel happy when I’m with Darum too…」<br/>
「Ah, Darum Wu?」<br/>
「Yes… Even though he is quiet and quick to anger… He looks really cute when he is mad.」<br/>
「W-Wait. You are older than Darum?」<br/>
「Yes. But we are just one year apart…」<br/>
I had the habit of grouping the men and the women in the Wu clan apart, so I never thought about their age as a whole before.<br/>
Of all the Wu clan siblings, only Vena Wu and Darum Wu’s position in the family was hard to differentiate.<br/>
Darum Wu was a year younger than Vena Wu, and was nineteen. I recorded this information in my mind.<br/>
「By the way, how old is Jiza Wu?」<br/>
「Jiza-nii is 23…」<br/>
「Oh! He’s younger than I thought! Rimee Wu is eight, right? Then… they are 15 years apart! That’s a lot!」<br/>
「Is that so…? Well, some girls have children when they are fifteen, so their age difference is comparable to a parent and child…」<br/>
Vena Wu looked at me adorably.<br/>
「I want to ask… Is this topic really interesting?」<br/>
Very.<br/>
The denizens of Forest’s Edge spent most of their day busy with chores, they probably feel that idling around was something unbearable.<br/>
「… I want to hear your story…」<br/>
「Ehh? I don’t know anything interesting?」<br/>
「… I want to know about your country…」<br/>
I turned silent for a moment as I stared at the red tarapa.<br/>
「I’m sorry, I don’t want to talk about my hometown too much… My heart turns heavy whenever I do.」<br/>
「Ara, but why…?」<br/>
「… After I disappeared suddenly, I don’t know if my father is able to accept that fact and live on.」<br/>
After a short moment of silence, Vena Wu muttered:「Sorry…」<br/>
The air between us was unexpectedly heavy.<br/>
And then—<br/>
「Asuta onii-chan!」<br/>
With that energetic voice, my little saviour charge here through the puddles.<br/>
Tara appeared before us.<br/>
「Amazing! You are really opening a stall here!」<br/>
Tara put her hand on the pushcart and looked up at me.<br/>
She then turned timidly towards Vena Wu beside me and smile.<br/>
Vena Wu smiled back.<br/>
「The tarapa smells nice! Is that the kiba meal?」<br/>
「Yes. I don’t know if you will like it.」<br/>
「I want to try! I want to buy one!」<br/>
「This is a portion for an adult, it cost two red copper plates each.」<br/>
「I see. I will ask Dad for the copper plates!」<br/>
「Ah, wait, it will be bad if you don’t like it. Try some first…Vena Wu, there’s a sack with a plate inside, can you bring it here?」<br/>
While I was instructing Vena Wu, I searched for something inside the pot.<br/>
It was some mini hamburg steak I moulded for the sake of taste testing.<br/>
The mini hamburg steak was one size smaller than the normal merchandize. I split it in half within the pot, then scooped half a mini hamburg steak onto a plate.<br/>
I then split that hamburg steak into three parts and took out my secret weapon— I sliced off some krilee branch, dried it and made this— toothpicks. I pick up one hamburg steak with it.<br/>
「Here, please try it.」<br/>
Tara just stood there when I offered her the plate.<br/>
「… Do you need copper plates?」<br/>
「This is a way my countries sell food. We will ask the customers to try before they buy it. I have already gotten permission from the venue and stall rental. Don’t hold back, try one.」<br/>
「I see… Thank you! I will help myself then!」<br/>
Tara grabbed one toothpick bravely and send the small hamburg steak into her mouth.<br/>
「… how is it?」<br/>
My heart was pounding at this moment.<br/>
Almost all the denizens of Forest’s Edge had nothing but praise for my cooking.<br/>
However, everyone understood the concept of cooking in Rock City and the Post Station Town, would my seasoning and culinary skills be of use— Leaving Kamyua Yost of dubious origins aside, this was the first time someone from the city will be commenting on my food.<br/>
Tara she—<br/>
Stood stiffly with the toothpick in her mouth.<br/>
She stared at me with her eyes opened in surprise.<br/>
「What is this…」<br/>
She finally squeezed out in a shocked voice.<br/>
Her small yellowish-brown face burst out in joy.<br/>
「Asuta-nii, this is delicious! Really delicious!」<br/>
I almost collapsed right there.<br/>
I was so scared that I almost had a heart attack.<br/>
But… I finally got through the first stage.<br/>
「It’s great! I want to eat more! I will get some copper plates from Papa!」<br/>
「Ah, wait! Tara, I want your father to try it too before I can accept your copper plates with ease… Eh, I don’t have many picks like this, can you reuse it?」<br/>
「Yes!」<br/>
Tara nodded vigorously and used the toothpick to take another piece of hamburg steak. She then took brisk steps as if she was relaying a holy flame and returned to her father.<br/>
Uncle Dora’s vegetable stall was a short distance away, and we could just manage to see the leather roof of his stall from here.<br/>
「…Asuta, that’s wonderful…」<br/>
「That’s right! That’s wonderful…! Ara, the light of hope seems brighter now! If the taste is acceptable, we just need to worry about attracting the customers to visit!」<br/>
「That’s the hardest part…」<br/>
「It’s fine, we are providing free samples to do draw them in! When the crowd increases, I will provide samples mainly to the southerners and easterners!」<br/>
However, I only grilled two mini burgers for taste testing. Each piece could only be divided into six, so there were only twelve portions.<br/>
If the hamburger meant to be merchandize couldn’t sell, I plan to give them out as samples too. Our goal was to let more people know how delicious kiba was. I wouldn’t mind even if we only gave out samples if our merchandize fail to sell<br/>
「Asuta… I don’t really want to talk to the people in the city proactively…」<br/>
「Hmm? Ah, I will receive them! Please help me watch the fire.」<br/>
「No, that’s part of my job… Please don’t be angry if I don’t do it well at the start okay…?」<br/>
As expected, the denizens of Forest’s Edge take their work very seriously.<br/>
The streets remained deserted, but my emotions became more heightened.<br/>
While I was chatting with Vena Wu, Tara ran over briskly again.<br/>
「Papa says it tastes great! He is very surprised too, and can’t believe that is what a kiba taste like.」<br/>
Tara handed over some copper plates.<br/>
The dull red copper plates— there were four of them?<br/>
「I want two! One for Tara, one for Papa.」<br/>
To be frank, I almost cried right there.<br/>
I was handsomely paid for the wedding banquet, but seeing a customer complimenting my cooking in front of me— my tear glands would definitely be stimulated.<br/>
To keep my pride as a man, I couldn’t cry here. I replied:「You are welcome!」 and started cutting tino and aria.<br/>
I placed the cut vegetables onto the grilled poitan, stacked a meat patty covered in tarapa sauce on top, and top it off with another grilled poitan.<br/>
「Here, thank you for waiting…! The fillings fall off easily, so hold it horizontally when you are eating it.」<br/>
「Yes! Thank you! It looks so yummy.」<br/>
I should be the one thanking her.<br/>
After passing the merchandize to Tara, I accept her copper plates.<br/>
Four red copper plates.<br/>
This was the first sale of our stall.<br/>
「… You have to sell one more burger to earn my wages, right? Is your business really sustainable…?」<br/>
「Of course! Although she is only here because we are acquainted, but the fact a Genos local is our first patrons fills me with hope.」<br/>
「I see… Ah, Asuta…」<br/>
She tugged on my waist band again.<br/>
I looked up, and someone dressed like a traveler was walking over from the north. He was looking at Tara who was jogging away and our stall in surprise.<br/>
He had a cloak, and a hood concealed his face. But I caught glimpses of his dark skin.<br/>
He was from the eastern kingdom Semu.<br/>
It was a good chance to do some promotions. I started offering the plate in my hands towards him.<br/>
But before I could even react, he walked quickly to our stall.<br/>
When he came near us, he pulled back his drenched hood.<br/>
He was a citizen of Semu, with black hair, eyes and skin.<br/>
He was a bit different from the African Americans from my world. The corners of his eyes were high, and he also had thin nose and lips. His facial features were similar to Orientals, while his body was slender and slim.<br/>
He tied his long black hair behind him, and accessories made by stringing up stones sparkling with beautiful colours adorned his neck and wrist. I couldn’t guess his age, but he seems to be young.<br/>
The youth from the eastern kingdom stopped before the stall and looked at the signboard with a stunned face.<br/>
He then pointed at the pot and asked:「Kiba?」<br/>
「Yes, this is food made from kiba. Would you like to try some?」<br/>
I took out a pick and scooped up the last piece of hamburg steak on the plate. The youth just tilted his head puzzledly.<br/>
「Asuta…」<br/>
Vena Wu whispered to me:<br/>
「Maybe this man from Semu can’t speak the language of the west…?」<br/>
「Huh! The four kingdoms each has their own unique language?」<br/>
「Only the eastern and northern language are different from us… Asuta, you don’t even know that…?」<br/>
I wasn’t aware at all.<br/>
If I woke up in the eastern or northern kingdom instead, would I experience a language barrier there? Or did some omnipotent power smoothed over this barrier?<br/>
Now wasn’t the time to worry about this, and I wouldn’t get an answer no matter how much I rack my brains over this. It was rare to see someone show interest in us, so I had to figure out a way to make him agree to eat the sample.<br/>
「Asuta, can you put more meat on the plates…? And give me one of those picks…」<br/>
「Ehh? alright.」<br/>
I scooped up the half mini hamburg steak inside the pot and split it into threes.<br/>
Vena Wu nodded, walked out of the cart and to the side of the youth.<br/>
When the youth back away guardedly, Vena Wu smiled at him, and gracefully pick up a sample and placed it in her mouth.<br/>
She then pushed the plate slightly towards the youth.<br/>
The youth raised his hand above the plate.<br/>
He cast a probing glance at Vena Wu.<br/>
Vena Wu smiled again, and the youth picked up the toothpick with a nod.<br/>
And then— He picked up all the hamburg steaks and put it in his mouth.<br/>
The youth chewed the hamburg steak, and after nodding with satisfaction, he made a strange gesture with his fingers and bowed towards Vena Wu and me. He put up his hood again and left with nimble steps.<br/>
After a few quiet seconds, Vena Wu apologized with a whimsical voice:<br/>
「… Sorry…」<br/>
「Not at all! You made him eat the sample hamburg steak, that’s incredible! The Post Station Town stalls had never provided sampling services, so this sort of things might happen.」<br/>
To encourage myself, I answered in a loud voice. Vena Wu started sobbing and hugged a pillar of the stall.<br/>
「… I want to die…」<br/>
Vena-nee was unexpectedly frail.<br/>
No, now wasn’t the time to have fun at her expense.<br/>
「It’s fine! There is still one sample left! Our battle will only start in the afternoon! Let’s do our best together okay?」<br/>
「…Asuta onii-chan, what’s the matter?」<br/>
Tara appeared before the stall suddenly.<br/>
「Nothing. Is the "Kiba burger" good?」<br/>
「That’s a Kiba burger? It’s yummy! Asuta-nii, will you be opening the stall here every day from now on?」<br/>
「Yes, I made a ten-day contract. The next ten days will have to depend on how business goes.」<br/>
「Yay! I will come buy this every day! Papa also says he want to eat this everyday too! He is really surprised!」<br/>
「Thank you, seeing you look so satisfied makes me happy.」<br/>
If Tara and her father really buys two burger a day, I could sell twenty burgers in these ten days. I needed to sell 60 burgers to break even, so their support was a great help.<br/>
「Asuta…」<br/>
Vena Wu called out to me.<br/>
Her voice was slightly different than usual.<br/>
「What is it?」<br/>
I turned my head and noticed the abnormal situation without needing her to explain.<br/>
「Uwah…」<br/>
Tara yelped, and hid on the other side of the push cart.<br/>
A group of people came from the crowded southern side and walked briskly to our stall.<br/>
「W-What do you want?」<br/>
A group of men in cloaks surrounded my stall.<br/>
Tara trembled a little and cling to my leg.<br/>
Vena Wu— stayed close to me, quietly gripping the knife on her waist.<br/>
There were seven of them.<br/>
They were all tall and wore hooded cloaks that concealed their faces and body.<br/>
However— the lower half of their faces that could be seen were all dark in colour.<br/>
「Kiba.」<br/>
The men in the centre pushed passed his companion and walked to the stall.<br/>
He took off his hood and revealed his slender face. He was the Semu man who ate all the samples just now.<br/>
「W-What" Is there any problem with us selling that?」<br/>
Even though he couldn’t understand, I still asked on reflex.<br/>
The youth continued pointing at the pot and muttered:<br/>
「Kiba.」<br/>
「Yes, this is kiba. What about it?」<br/>
「Kiba. Red. One, two, three?」<br/>
「…What?」<br/>
After I tilted my head quizzingly, the youth reached inside his cloak troublingly.<br/>
Vena Wu wanted to pull me away— But what he took out was dull red copper plates.<br/>
「Kiba. Red, one, two, three?」<br/>
When I still didn’t answer, the youth’s eyes showed a tint of sorrow.<br/>
「… White?」<br/>
「No! It’s red! Two!」<br/>
The youth nodded, then took out another copper plate and placed both on the stall table with a clink.<br/>
He stared right at me.<br/>
「…Vena Wu, please help me stir.」<br/>
I was so frightened that I forgot to stir the sauce.<br/>
I handed the spatula to Vena Wu, and quickly started to chop the tino.<br/>
After making one "Kiba burger", I handed it to that young man.<br/>
「Please enjoy.」<br/>
The youth nodded firmly and received the merchandize.<br/>
I observed him as I timidly reached for the copper plates— fortunately, no one stopped me. They were just normal customers after all.<br/>
My heart was filled with gratitude.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
But, just who were these people standing unmoving around the stall?<br/>
「Asuta onii-chan…」<br/>
「I-It’s fine. I think… they are just customers.」<br/>
The youth ate the "Kiba burger" with large bites.<br/>
He held the burger with one hand at the start, but when he noticed the tarapa almost dripping out from the other end, he held it with both hands instead.<br/>
He then bit into the burger again.<br/>
Strange, even though he didn’t feel like a cold person, his expression remained blank.<br/>
It wasn’t to the extent of being creepy… but it still felt uncomfortable.<br/>
The youth quickly finished the burger, made a strange gesture with his fingers again and bowed quietly.<br/>
He then nodded to his companions.<br/>
The group of tall men nodded at the same time and reached into their cloaks.<br/>
Clink clang clink— they all placed their red copper plates onto the stall table.<br/>
Six persons’ worth, a total of twelve red copper plates.<br/>
I cut the tino quietly and finished all the "Kiba burger" one by one.<br/>
I handed the finished products to them, and they received the burgers with their black fingers one at a time.<br/>
There was silence.<br/>
I didn’t speak, the customers were quiet, Vena Wu and Tara didn’t make a sound either.<br/>
After a few minutes, the six "Kiba burger" all ended up in the men’s stomach. In addition to the first man, I collected 14 copper plates in total.<br/>
Like the youth earlier, the six hooded men made a gesture with their fingers, bowed, then left at the same time.<br/>
「Hey Asuta, your cooking sure is popular!」<br/>
「Uwah, that scared me!」<br/>
I didn’t even notice that a slender blonde figure was standing beside the stall.<br/>
It goes without saying that was Kamyua Yost.<br/>
「W-W-Where did you come from? Please don’t appear in such a heart attack inducing way!」<br/>
「I didn’t want to get in the way of your business, so I had been watching over you quietly from the side. I was in the shade of those trees all along. Didn’t you notice?」<br/>
I really felt like punching this guy who was pretending to be retarded.<br/>
Vena Wu also rolled her eyes at Kamyua Yost who was all smiles. Her gaze appeared to be much less sexy.<br/>
Only Tara was excited.<br/>
「Uncle Kamyua, you are here! Asuta onii-san’s burger is really delicious!」<br/>
「That’s right, it looks tasty. You are using tarapa as an ingredient huh. Your cooking with just aria and tino is already delicious, the food this time looked even more appetizing.」<br/>
He complimented with a casual tone like usual.<br/>
「… Who were that group of people earlier?」<br/>
「Hmm? Probably travelers from the eastern kingdom Semu. Considering their numbers, they are likely related to a large merchant caravan.」<br/>
「You didn’t bribe them?」<br/>
「Bribe? What do you mean? You think I hired people to act like customers in an attempt to raise your stall’s reputation?」<br/>
Kamyua Yost smirked and shrugged his shoulders that was covered by his cloak.<br/>
「If I want to use such a plan, I will arrange for a better performance! The crowd is sparse here, your stall’s fame won’t increase even if I send a large group of people over. Look, no one even know you have sold seven meals in one go.」<br/>
He was right. As we were quite some distance from the bustling south, even if someone observed what happened here, they would just see a cloaked group surround the stall, then left quickly.<br/>
Only the old man selling accessories beside us was staring with a dumbfounded face.<br/>
「Most easterners are like that. They aren’t a race that closes themselves off, but they only focus on their own objectives and ignore others… They think it’s rude to show their emotion. But if you talk with them, you will find them interesting. Unfortunately, they have no intention of learning the language of the west.」<br/>
「I see…」<br/>
「But not all easterners are like that. Some of them understand the customs of the west. If you open a stall in the Post Station Town, you will slowly understand the characteristics from the various different places.」<br/>
Kamyua said as he reached inside his cloak.<br/>
「Well then, can I place my order now, Asuta? I want two meals, one of them is for Leito.」<br/>
「Well… We only have one left.」<br/>
「Ehh? Tara bought two, the easterners bought seven, you only sold nine, right? Why are you already sold out?」<br/>
Just when did this uncle started spying on us?<br/>
The more time I spent with him, instead of understanding him more, I find him even more suspicious. This was the first time I met someone like that.<br/>
「I thought my sales for the first day would be low, so I only prepared ten portions. I didn’t want to waste the ingredient costs after all.」<br/>
「How could you do that!? Your cooking is delicious, it’s impossible that you will only sell ten! You brought such a big pot, but you are only selling ten portions! I’m so disappointed, Leito and I were both looking forward to your meal!」<br/>
「I’m sorry. There’s still some samples left, I will give them to you okay? I grilled some extra poitan too.」<br/>
「Yes! Sell them to me! I won’t allow any other patrons to take them away!」<br/>
His anxious expression seemed genuine.<br/>
I understood him less when I saw him make such an expression.<br/>
I used the last hamburg steak and the mini hamburg steak to make two "Kiba burgers", and collected two copper plates from Kamyua. The mini burger was given to him free of charge.<br/>
「Thank you! I will share this delicious meal with Leito! I will head back to the 《Kimyusu’s tail inn》 first, I will tell you my comments later!」<br/>
Kamyua quickly disappeared without a trace.<br/>
Vena Wu and I looked at each other, our heart filled with a sense of powerlessness.<br/>
「Erm… We are done for the day.」<br/>
「Yes… Can I put out the fire…?」<br/>
「Yes please.」<br/>
This must be how it felt to be completely clueless.<br/>
In the first day battle in the Post Station Town, we didn’t even last until noon, and closed shop in less than an hour.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
3<br/>
「… I’m back.」<br/>
After opening the door, Ai Fa who was seated with her back to the wall received me with a surprised face.<br/>
「What happened? Was there some incident in the Post Station Town?」<br/>
「No, we sold all our food, so we came back.」<br/>
「That’s… too early. It’s not even noon, right?」<br/>
「Yes. I went to quite a number of places before coming back.」<br/>
I brought the ingredients for tomorrow, chatted with Uncle Dora for a while, went to 《Kimyusu’s tail inn》 to return the pushcart and asked for feedback from Kamyua and Leito. After coming back to Forest’s Edge, I washed the pots at the water source before returning to the Fa house.<br/>
I didn’t even spend much time heating the tarapa sauce. I gave the leftovers to Vena Wu, and she bought a leather pouch immediately in the Post Station Town to take the sauce. She then went back home happily.<br/>
I put the rest of the firewood with the pushcart and returned it to the inn. With just the ingredients and cooking utensils, I came home without much load.<br/>
I put the pot back onto the stove, kept the tarapa, gigo and other vegetables into the food store, then sat down opposite Ai Fa.<br/>
「All ten burgers I prepared got sold out. After accounting for all the expenses, I made about five red copper plates today. The first day of business is a success.」<br/>
I didn’t know why, but I felt dissatisfied with today’s result.<br/>
To make Ai Fa understand how I felt, I told her everything that happened today.<br/>
「Yes… everything was sold out because they acknowledge your culinary skills, right? Just be happy about your accomplishments then.」<br/>
「You’re right, but we don’t know how long those easterners will stay in the Post Station Town, so I can’t predict how business would be in the coming days.」<br/>
To be honest, I failed to 「make a name」 and 「become the talk of town」.<br/>
Just what did the people in the city thought when they saw us pushed the cart back painstakingly after opening for less than an hour? Did they think we caused some problem and had no choice but to close shop?<br/>
My persecution complex was probably playing tricks on my mind, but the gazes from the citizens did feel painful.<br/>
On top of that, the easterners weren’t fluent with the western language, so there wouldn’t be much word of mouth effect.<br/>
「… Running a business is really complicated.」<br/>
Ai Fa scratched her blonde hair and leaned in close to me.<br/>
「That might be so, but you still completed your job. Be happier about it.」<br/>
「Yes…」<br/>
「I’m telling you to be happier about it.」<br/>
Ai Fa suddenly reached out and pinched my left cheek hard.<br/>
「It hurts it hurts! You are going to pull my cheek off! Why did you pinch me!?」<br/>
「I told you to be happier, but you wouldn’t listen.」<br/>
Ai Fa had a gentle smile on her face.<br/>
「I’m really happy you know?」<br/>
「Ai Fa, you—」<br/>
「Hmm?」<br/>
「You have been smiling a lot more recently…? It hurts it hurts!」<br/>
「Hmmp!」<br/>
Ai Fa’s rare smile was gone. She stood up and took down the cape hanging on the wall.<br/>
「It hurts ahh… Oh, it’s already time for you to head into the woods?」<br/>
「Yes. Asuta, what are you going to do now?」<br/>
「Oh right. It’s too early to prepare the ingredients. I will think about the future plans, then go chop some wood.」<br/>
「I already chopped the wood. Never mind, you are free, so chop more then.」<br/>
After saying that, Ai Fa came near to the seated me.<br/>
「I’m off… be careful today alright?」<br/>
「Yes, if any strange drunkards approach me, I will run away.」<br/>
「Okay.」<br/>
Ai Fa nodded with a strong gleam in her eyes.<br/>
After the Lutim wedding banquet, she would always show such a gaze when she leaves me behind and head into the woods.<br/>
Ai Fa then left for the forest, and I was home alone.<br/>
It’s noon…<br/>
I should be in the Post Station Town that was starting get bustling and give out samples. But now, I’m sitting inside the house alone.<br/>
The powerlessness in my heart far exceeds my sense of pride and accomplishment.<br/>
「Never mind, there’s no use in mulling over it. The battle starts tomorrow, tomorrow!」<br/>
It was a bit risky, but I decided to grill twenty meat patties for tomorrow.<br/>
If business turned out terrible, I will change it back to ten portions the next day.<br/>
If I sell them quickly tomorrow too, I will slowly increase the numbers day by day. To minimize the ingredient cost, I had to adapt quickly.<br/>
There is no need to be anxious. Unless the losses are too heavy, I can set up stall in the Post Station Town for the next ten to twenty days, and slowly work towards getting good results.<br/>
When I saw Ai Fa being sincerely happy for me, my thinking became more positive.<br/>
The situation developed unexpectedly, but I thought the sales on the first day would be terrible, and I sold everything instead. I should be happy about this.<br/>
Besides, even though I knew most of my customers, Tara, Uncle Dora, Kamyua Yost and Leito all had nothing but praises for the "Kiba burger".<br/>
I shouldn’t be so uneasy and should face tomorrow’s work with a heartful of hope.<br/>
「Okay…! Let’s chop some wood!」<br/>
I took out the machete and a bundle of wood from the store room and prepared to leave the house.<br/>
When I was about to push the door open— someone knocked on the door twice.<br/>
(— A guest?)<br/>
After living in the Fa house for a month, aside from Rimee Wu and the Kaslan couple, there had never been any other guest.<br/>
Noon had just past, and everyone knew the hunters had entered the woods to hunt, so Ai Fa wasn’t home.<br/>
As I was thinking about it, there was another two knocks.<br/>
I placed the firewood and machete by me feet and pressed my hand onto my chest to regulate my breathing.<br/>
「… Who is it?」<br/>
Silence.<br/>
I slowly reached for the door bar leaning against the wall.<br/>
Should I barricade myself in, or escape outside? The more options I had, the better it was.<br/>
When my hand was almost touching the door bar, a voice came from the other side of the door.<br/>
「I’m… Celice Von Fou from the Fou house.」<br/>
An unfamiliar name.<br/>
From her voice, she should be a frail woman.<br/>
After hesitating for a few seconds, I gently pulled open the door.<br/>
A young, slender woman was standing outside.<br/>
She was covered from her chest to her knees with a single piece of cloth and held a baby younger than Kota Wu in her arms.<br/>
I finally let down my guard.<br/>
「I’m a member of the Fa house, Asuta. Do you have business with Ai Fa?」<br/>
「Yes… No… H-Has Ai Fa gone into the forest?」<br/>
「She just left. I can pass a message if you need.」<br/>
「I see… Excuse me, this is for you two…」<br/>
The woman picked up the bag by her feet, which was full.<br/>
The bag was big, but pressed flat and looked light.<br/>
「What is this?」<br/>
「Erm… This is… pico leaves…」<br/>
The woman before me seemed more guarded than I was.<br/>
Well, the residents around here probably think I look suspicious, so it couldn’t be helped.<br/>
「Pico leaves huh. Why are you giving us pico leaves?」<br/>
「Actually… the thing is… Ai Fa gave us a lot of hides…」<br/>
「Hides?」<br/>
I was confused.<br/>
「You mean kiba hide?」<br/>
「Yes… About a month ago, we received numerous hides… My house, which is the Fou house, didn’t have many men, and can’t hunt enough kiba. But ever since the Fa house gifted us with these hides, this child finally has enough to eat…」<br/>
「I see— This is the first time I’m hearing this. So my house head do interact with our neighbours.」<br/>
Celice Von Fou’s eyes looked troubled as she hugged her baby tightly.<br/>
「No… We didn’t interact… Our house head forbid the Fou house from fraternizing with the Fa house…」<br/>
「Ehh?」<br/>
「After relations deteriorate between the Fa house and the chieftain house, our house head thinks that the Fou house would get on the bad side of the chieftain house if we fraternize with the Fa house… So two years ago, he forbade us from interacting with the Fa house…」<br/>
「I see. I have heard about that.」<br/>
And so, Ai Fa deliberately broke off ties with the other houses.<br/>
So why did she gift the hides to the Fou house?<br/>
「…Ai Fa always leave the hide at our doorsteps quietly.」<br/>
Celice Von Fou stared at me.<br/>
Her pale blue eyes were teary.<br/>
「I didn’t know who put the hide there, and felt it was creepy… But in order to fill our stomachs, we had to accept them. We tanned the hides, traded it for copper plates, and bought aria and poitan… And now I’m able to nurse this child…」<br/>
「… I see.」<br/>
「A few days ago, the men from the Fou house saw Ai Fa place a freshly skinned hide at the door steps of the Fou house… And so, we finally learned the identity of our benefactor. But even so, the head of the Fou house was still unwilling to renew relations with the Fa house… So all the women begged the house head, and asked him to at least let us give Ai Fa a gift as thanks…」<br/>
Celice Von Fou closed her eyes.<br/>
「The Fou house do not have sufficient copper plates and can’t give a luxurious gift. But you can never have too much pico leaves… This is foraged by all the women of the Fou house.」<br/>
「I see…」<br/>
「I know such a trivial gift isn’t enough to repay Ai Fa’s kindness, but I still want to give her my thanks. Even though the Fou house broke off ties with the Fa house out of fear of antagonizing the Tsun clan, she still did so much for us… We feel so ashamed…」<br/>
「Please don’t mind it. The Fa house don’t have enough people to tan the hides anyway. Besides, my house head has no intention of letting you know this.」<br/>
「But…」<br/>
「I’m grateful for your kind gesture. If the chance arises, I hope you can talk to her personally. I don’t know the entire story, so I can’t say anything on Ai Fa’s behalf.」<br/>
「… Alright, thank you.」<br/>
Celice Von Fou left the squashed bags behind and left.<br/>
I opened them, and found it packed with pico leaves. This was the volume Ai Fa and I forage in a day.<br/>
After foraging pico leaves for their house, it must be difficult to pick so much more for us.<br/>
…Ai Fa gave them our excess hides, not meat. Doing this won’t make the denizens of Forest’s Edge depraved.<br/>
If anyone criticize Ai Fa’s action, I will do everything I could to defend her.<br/>
One month ago— That was when Ai Fa took me in.<br/>
After butchering my first kiba, Ai Fa must have gifted it to the Fou house. Ai Fa had always been responsible for the disposal of the kiba’s hide and organs.<br/>
A prosperous life huh…<br/>
As a mere mortal, I couldn’t understand Kaslan Lutim’s grand vision.<br/>
And Kamyua Yost might not have any such ambitions at all.<br/>
However— I didn’t think an impoverished life where one was so famished that they couldn’t even nurse a child was normal.<br/>
Furthermore, when there were people starving, there was some who took the money that should be dispersed to the people and live lavishly.<br/>
Unfortunately, my prowess is limited, and I can’t be of much help.<br/>
After keeping the pico leaves into the food store, I started wielding my machete to chop the firewood I needed to use tomorrow.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
4<br/>
It was the second day of operation of the kiba food stall operated by the Fa house.<br/>
Although all the food was sold out on the opening day, the helplessness I felt was far stronger than any sense of pride and accomplishment. But it also spurred me on, so I felt hyped early in the morning.<br/>
「I prepared twenty burgers today! It will be incredible if everything is sold out today! Vena Wu, let’s do our best!」<br/>
「Yes… Asuta, was this is all done by you…? Didn’t you need to handle the other chores…?」<br/>
「I made them all myself. I realized that making twenty burgers isn’t hard at all. I don’t mind preparing the food every day.」<br/>
I wasn’t pushing myself.<br/>
Yesterday, I prepared the tarapa sauce and meat patty ahead of time.<br/>
I prepared the food while making dinner and finished my work after dinner was done. Previously, before the decision to open the stall, I always chatted idly with Ai Fa after dinner, but now we had to do that while I was preparing the food.<br/>
And so, I just had to grill the poitan and hamburg steak.<br/>
After the tribulations of the banquet at the Wu clan and the Lutim wedding, I accumulated a lot of experience in cooking a large amount of food. Now, I could prepare twenty burgers in no time. Even if I pushed myself to the maximum limit for one day— forty burgers, I could finish them easily without sacrificing time for sleep or stall opening.<br/>
「It’s no problem at all! Let’s work hard!」<br/>
「… But there aren’t many people during this time…」<br/>
There wasn’t any sudden rain today, but the streets remained deserted.<br/>
Our stall was on the northernmost edge of the Post Station Town. Aside from the Genos city, only the stone paved road and the woods could be seen if one ventured further north. Only real travelers would pass by here.<br/>
The south of the Post Station Town was filled with farmland, so there were many farming villages. Hence, many of the stalls were concentrated in the south. The inn was also located in the south, so those lodging there would head directly to the bustling south to purchase their goods. It was no wonder that the southern side was so crowded.<br/>
Before the number of pedestrians increases in the noon, we can only focus on the few sparse passersby.<br/>
「Oh, other than the castle down to the west, where else does this road lead to?」<br/>
「I don’t know…? Probably the northern kingdom Mahildra…?」<br/>
「Mahildra is the kingdom in the northernmost edge of the continent, right? Genos is in the western kingdom, located on the southern side. That means there should be many cities along the way towards the north, right?」<br/>
「I don’t know… If I keep thinking about that, I might set off on a journey before I know it, so I try not to think about it…」<br/>
「… I see.」<br/>
「Yes… I see, so there are all sorts of cities in the western kingdom… If we head to the other cities, people won’t call us 《Kiba Eaters》…」<br/>
Vena Wu looked to the north with a melancholic face.<br/>
「Vena Wu, you want to go to a faraway place because you don’t like the people in the city calling you a "Kiba Eater", right?」<br/>
「No… Not because of that… Well, maybe… Anyway, I just want to live nakedly…」<br/>
「N-Nakedly?」<br/>
「Yes… In Forest’s Edge, I’m the eldest daughter of the Wu clan… In the Post Station Town, I’m a 《Kiba Eater》… Only my family accepts the real me… I hope for more people to know the naked me… That’s why I want to go to a faraway place…」<br/>
She glanced at me sideways with a flirty look.<br/>
「That is why I’m attracted to you… You are not bound by the common sense of Forest’s Edge and Post Station Town… You can see the real me…」<br/>
「W-When you did that barbaric act last time, you actually thought this far? I didn’t speak much with you back then.」<br/>
「Yes… I was drawn to you in the beginning because you came from a faraway place and didn’t even know the name of this continent… However, I wouldn’t have acted that way if you didn’t have a certain level of charm…」<br/>
Vena Wu was hardworking, but when she became idle, she would become mischievous.<br/>
I really wished for Tara visiting us at a time like this. As I thought about that quietly, I scanned the road before us.<br/>
At this moment, I found a good target.<br/>
「Ah! That person looks like a foreigner, is he a resident of Genos?」<br/>
The target was a man who didn’t have brown or ivory skin, but white skin with a tint of red.<br/>
He had a plump body with short limbs and dark brown hair. I couldn’t see his facial features clearly because there was some distance between us, but I could tell he had a beard.<br/>
The man wore a sleeveless shirt and long pants. This western attire was similar to what Leito wore, and he kept heading north as he browsed the stalls on both sides of the street.<br/>
「Which country do the white-skinned people come from?」<br/>
「Ehh…? They are from the southern kingdom Jaguar…」<br/>
My guess was right.<br/>
The western kingdom and the northern kingdom were enemies, so people from the north wouldn’t appear in this town. Through the process of elimination, I concluded that this person must be from the southern kingdom. The denizens of Forest’s Edge came from the south and had light brown skin, so I thought they would have similar skin tone with the other southerners.<br/>
「The people with yellowish-brown skin are locals in Genos. There are many ivory-skinned people too, where are they from?」<br/>
「Both kinds of person are citizens of the western kingdom… When I was young, Grandma Jiba told me that Genos was exceptionally wealthy in the western kingdom, so many people will migrate to this land to search for job opportunities.」<br/>
I see.<br/>
This meant that the ivory skinned people only settled down here in the past decades, and some of them were even born here. They didn’t look as uncaring as the southerners and easterners when they were facing the denizens of Forest’s Edge and didn’t show fear or disdain like the Genos locals.<br/>
Hence, I should set my customer group to be the ivory-skinned people. I might be able to get through to the Genos locals through them.<br/>
That aside, the pressing thing right now was to run my business.<br/>
The man gradually approached us from the south.<br/>
He didn’t have any large luggage, so it was impossible for him to head off to the north. I quietly cut the mini hamburg steak samples and prayed in my heart for him to come near us, so we could have a chance to talk with him.<br/>
「Asuta… It’s better for you to receive the southerners…」<br/>
「Ehh? But why?」<br/>
「Many elderly southerners still hold a grudge against the denizens of Forest’s Edge… They think we are traitors of the southern god Jaguar…」<br/>
Not disdain or fear, but hostility.<br/>
In the Post Station Town, the southern white people and the eastern black people were roughly equal in numbers, but I had never seen any southerners showing hostility towards us.<br/>
「Well… The east and south are enemies, so they have their hands full being hostile to the town that is filled with Semu people…?」<br/>
「Ehh? The east and west kingdoms are on bad terms?」<br/>
「…Asuta, you really don’t know anything…」<br/>
Vena Wu smiled, her tone was partially shocked and partially joyful.<br/>
「Since ancient times, the east and south have been enemy nations, just like the west and north… As the west maintained cordial relations with both kingdoms, the east and south citizens are prohibited from causing any trouble here… Those who break this law will not be permitted into the western kingdom again, so such incidents are rare…」<br/>
As the Fa house didn’t have much kins, Ai Fa didn’t have the chance to obtain such information. In contrast, the Wu clan were well-informed because of their many relatives.<br/>
Enough about that, let’s focus on business for now.<br/>
That southerner seemed to have plenty of time, but he didn’t seem like he was looking for anything specific and was just browsing each stall carefully.<br/>
When he finally reached the old man’s accessory stall beside us, I clenched my fists in a victory pose in my heart.<br/>
Awesome!<br/>
At this moment— my eyes met that man.<br/>
He was older than I thought, probably more than fifty years old.<br/>
The man had a large head, plain face, and short body. He looked bulkier than the Genos locals, and a beard covered his mouth.<br/>
Under his bushy brows were a pair of green eyes with a frightening sharp gleam.<br/>
He passed the accessory stall and took large strides towards us.<br/>
「Kiba…? You’re selling kiba?」<br/>
I wanted to reply with a smile, but he didn’t give me the chance and continued:<br/>
「Are you retarded? Who will eat the tough and stinky kiba meat? Only people like you can stomach it. You even used tarapa on it, how arrogant. You don’t even understand what cuisines taste like, so aria and poitan are enough for you. I suggest for you to close the shop and go home before you spend all your tusks and horns.」<br/>
His words flowed like a machine gun, not giving me any opportunity to interject.<br/>
After saying what was on his mind, he started turning to leave.<br/>
「Excuse me, but I can assure you that kiba meat is delicious! Do you want to try it?」<br/>
「What?」<br/>
The man turned his head and glared at me unhappily.<br/>
「Are you retarded? Why must I eat kiba meat? The city has Kimyusu, karon, and all sorts of meat that taste a hundred times better than kiba. Kiba won’t sell, retard! My skin will turn as black as yours if I eat kiba, and everyone will roll their eyes at me.」<br/>
「T-That’s just a misconception. I also ate plenty of kiba meat, but my skin tone is still the same.」<br/>
I already predicted that I would encounter terrible customers like him.<br/>
This man didn’t fear or detest the denizens of Forest’s Edge, so maybe he could be considered one of the better ones.<br/>
「… Why is a brat like you wearing clothing from Forest’s Edge and selling kiba? Did you get seduced by that sexy Forest’s Edge lady? Are you retarded? Never mind, no matter how retarded, that’s a life that you chose. Since you like women from Forest’s Edge, then just stay in the forest and no one will have any complaints.」<br/>
「No, kiba meat is really delicious! It’s a waste for just the denizens of Forest’s Edge to eat them, so I decided to set up a stall here. The samples are free, why don’t you try them? It’s fine to think that I’m tricking you.」<br/>
My retail smile was perfect.<br/>
The man sighed, then stood before the stall.<br/>
He leaned towards the sample plate on the table, then said:「Even the presentation is bad.」<br/>
He had been making disparaging comments since the beginning, but his tone was calm, so I didn’t feel any obvious hostility or malevolence.<br/>
I wasn’t angered by his attitude, but couldn’t help lamenting in my heart:「He looks like a boorish man, but he is so well spoken.」<br/>
「This is free right? I won’t pay copper plates for this.」<br/>
「Of course, it is free.」<br/>
I nodded with a smile.<br/>
He frowned his pale forehead and picked up the toothpick.<br/>
After tossing one-sixth of the mini hamburg steak into his mouth, he chewed carefully and swallowed it.<br/>
He glared at me once again.<br/>
「… It tastes terrible. You lied to me.」<br/>
「Ehh?」<br/>
「Kiba meat didn’t stink like I imagined, and it isn’t too tough. But it is gooey and has horrible texture. I can feel a strange taste going up my nose. It can’t be compared to kimyusu and karon. Your tarapa is cooked well, it’s a waste to pair it with kiba. Are there really people who will pay for this thing? You actually thought that this food tastes good, no wonder everyone mocks you people as "Kiba Eaters".」<br/>
Could it be — this dish was really not to his liking?<br/>
So the problem was both the texture of the hamburg steak and how the kiba meat tastes.<br/>
I thought this might happen, but I didn’t imagine things would go bad so fast.<br/>
「…Asuta.」<br/>
At this moment, Vena Wu tugged on my waist band<br/>
I still felt a little shocked, and after following Vena Wu’s gaze—<br/>
The familiar cloaked group was approaching with brisk steps.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
5<br/>
「W-What do you want!? Are you trying to start trouble inside the western territories?」<br/>
The Jaguar man yelled.<br/>
The cloaked group stayed some distance from us and surrounded us in a semicircle.<br/>
Their numbers had clearly grown.<br/>
「… We no intent, start trouble.」<br/>
One of them answered stiffly in the language of the west.<br/>
「We, want buy, kiba meal. Now, queuing.」<br/>
That person walked to the front and took off his hood.<br/>
He had dark skin, the corners of his eyes were high, the bridge of his nose was thin, and he had thin lips.<br/>
He looked very similar to the youth who visited yesterday— but this man’s hair was silvery white, just like Grandma Jiba.<br/>
But he was a young man, with no sign of aging on his face. This was probably his natural hair color.<br/>
「We, queue. We, buy, ten.」<br/>
「A-Are you all retards? You are willing to pay for such nasty tasting meat, you must be insane. That’s like throwing copper plates into the brazier. Kiba meat is food for the denizens of Forest’s Edge. Your skin can’t get any darker, so eating bad tasting meat will just be a pain.」<br/>
The young silvered hair man tilted his head quizzingly.<br/>
「I, yet to try. But, seven, brethren, yesterday try. All say, tasty. So, ten brethren, come… Please, ten meals.」<br/>
「Okay, thank you for your patronage.」<br/>
I was a bit shocked that someone disputed the tastiness of kiba, but I still started chopping tino.<br/>
At this moment, the ten customers quietly placed their copper plates on the table with loud clinking sounds.<br/>
「This is unbelievable. Can’t Semu people tell the taste of meat? This isn’t food normal people will eat. If you want to eat meat, then try kimyusu or karon.」<br/>
This man kept disrupting my business, but his attitude was calm and wasn’t scolding anyone loudly. The Semu people were expressionless and ignored him. As the stall owner, I was at a loss.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Anyway, I started making ten "Kiba burgers」.<br/>
The young silver-haired man was the first to take the meal. After finishing it with a blank expression, he nodded firmly, then turned towards the southerners.<br/>
「Kiba, delicious. Red, two, satisfied.」<br/>
「How can something so retarded happen? There must be something wrong with your tongues… Hey, get over here you guys!」<br/>
He shouted again.<br/>
A group of white-skinned men walked over, probably in response to his order.<br/>
The cloaked group quickly squeezed together and gave up space to them, with the "Kiba burgers" still in their hands.<br/>
「What’s the matter, Pops? It sure seems tense here.」<br/>
When the group of southerners got here, a young Jaguar man said in a crude tone.<br/>
This young man had brown hair and green eyes. He wasn’t tall, but he was burly.<br/>
All the men from Jaguar had small stature. Including the middle-aged man earlier, this group had eight people, and only two of them were taller than me.<br/>
But all of them were buff, with wide shoulders and faces.<br/>
Their hair color and age varied, but most of them had bushy beards.<br/>
「Look at this lot. They claim that kiba meat tastes good. I tried it just now, but I don’t think it’s worth paying money for. Can’t people from Semu differentiate good and bad tasting food?」<br/>
He sounded very indignant.<br/>
He was probably really triggered.<br/>
「Pops, did you actually eat kiba meat? How can that ever taste good?」<br/>
The Jaguar youth stole a few glances our way, then grabbed his companion’s thick arms.<br/>
「… Besides, let’s not get involved with the denizens of Forest’s Edge. They are more troublesome than those Semu people. We don’t know what will happen if things go out of hand.」<br/>
「I’m just preaching the truth. They are the ones who are weird… If you think I’m lying, then try it too.」<br/>
「I don’t want to eat kiba meat.」<br/>
「Alright, just try it… Hey you, let these guys taste this kiba meat.」<br/>
His demands were unreasonable.<br/>
However, this was a precious opportunity.<br/>
There might not be many Jaguar people in town, but things would be serious if they couldn’t accept the taste of kiba on a biological level.<br/>
"Kiba burger" was just a changeup pitch. If people didn’t like its unique texture, I could just switch and sell simple grilled meat instead.<br/>
I already used the strong taste of the tarapa in my cooking, but Pops still complained about the taste of the kiba meat.<br/>
Was this the personal preference of Pops, or were all Jaguar people unable to accept kiba? Even though his tone was rude, I couldn’t let this chance go since he asked for samples.<br/>
I scooped the mini hamburg steak lying in the bottom of the pot, put it on the plate, and divided it into six.<br/>
There were still five samples from the first batch. I placed the plate on the platform and prepared toothpicks to match the number of people.<br/>
「Please take one.」<br/>
The three older Jaguar men took the sample without any hesitation.<br/>
Pops had to push the other young men and urged them to try it before they took the toothpicks.<br/>
By the way, the cloaked group had already finished their "Kiba burger" but didn’t leave for some reason. They didn’t look curious at all and just stood by the side with a blank expression.<br/>
「How is it? It tastes horrible, right?」<br/>
Pops crossed his arms and surveyed his companions.<br/>
And the men… showed all sorts of expressions.<br/>
「Just be honest if you think it tastes bad.」<br/>
Only two men answered him.<br/>
An older man said:「Tastes bad.」 A youth said:「Doesn’t taste good.」<br/>
「Only two of you?」<br/>
Pops said with his eyes widened in surprise.<br/>
He was just like Donda Wu some days ago.<br/>
「What do you think? Do you really think it tastes good?」<br/>
Another older man shared:「… It’s not awful.」 Some other youth commented:「It’s kind of good.」<br/>
And finally, the tallest of the older trio, a youth who looked younger than me, and the young man who spoke in a crude tone at the very start just stood quietly there.<br/>
「… It’s good.」<br/>
The crude young man muttered.<br/>
「W-What is this? Hey, is this really kiba?」<br/>
「Yes, it’s 100% kiba. That’s neither karon nor kimyusu.」<br/>
My heart was tense, but I still answered with a smile:<br/>
「It’s priced at two red copper plates. Would you like to buy one?」<br/>
「Two red copper plates, huh.」<br/>
The tall man pushed the youth aside and walked over.<br/>
He had a burly figure and was rather old. His face was as fierce as Pops.<br/>
He handed over the copper plates and said:「Give me one.」<br/>
「Thank you! Please wait a moment.」<br/>
「Hey Arudas! Are you willing to pay for this nasty tasting meat?」<br/>
The man named Arudas turned towards Pops impatiently.<br/>
「Pops, I know the meat doesn’t suit your taste, but you can’t make a commotion in front of other people’s stall. The guards might take you away.」<br/>
「B-But…」<br/>
「You think it tastes bad, but it’s heavenly to me. Everyone has different taste, so don’t be so alarmed.」<br/>
Everyone has different taste—<br/>
That’s right, the taste of the kiba was unique. I thought kiba was more delicious than beef, pork, and kimyusu. With so many people here, it wouldn’t be surprising to find some people who didn’t like kiba meat.<br/>
I already told myself that way ahead of time.<br/>
But even so, I still felt a heat well up in me— I was still a half-baked chef after all.<br/>
「Hey, give me one too.」<br/>
The youngest Jaguar man who was standing there stiffly also handed copper plates over to me.<br/>
「Thank you!」<br/>
I answered and handed a completed burger to the older man who ordered earlier. At this moment, another man walked over and said:「It looks delicious.」 He was the youth who said「It was kinda good.」 earlier.<br/>
「Bro, I want one too.」<br/>
「Okay! Thank you!」<br/>
「M-M-Me too!」<br/>
The youth with the rude attitude finally made up his mind and handed over the copper plates.<br/>
Of the seven men— no, they were eight including Pops, only four of them bought a "Kiba burger".<br/>
Half of them acknowledge my cooking.<br/>
I accepted this result a little vexingly.<br/>
It was popular with all the easterners, but only half of the southerners thought it is good. This meant that a person’s preferred taste depended on their country of origin.<br/>
Lost in deep thoughts, I started chopping the tino and aria.<br/>
At this moment the tall Jaguar man Arudas who was the first to buy a "Kiba burger" said with a sigh:<br/>
「Uwah, this is delicious!」<br/>
His wide face that looked as hard as a rock was now showing pure bliss and surprise.<br/>
「Kiba actually tastes this good. Strange, why do people say kiba is tough and stinks. It tastes much better than karon.」<br/>
I stole a glance at the leader of the group, Pops. He was scratching his head with a frustrated look.<br/>
「The tarapa is great too, the sourness is just right. What’s that thing mixed together with the tino?」<br/>
「That’s sliced raw aria.」<br/>
「Raw aria! It’s a bit spicy, but it complements the meat really well. I suddenly feel an urge to drink fruit wine.」<br/>
「That’s right. Hey, I didn’t see you here at noon yesterday. Is the stall closed in the evenings?」<br/>
「Yes. As Forest’s Edge is some distance away from here, we close the shop in the afternoon.」<br/>
「Such a pity. Dinner in the inn costs four red copper plates, I would rather eat two of these.」<br/>
The southerners looked fierce when they were quiet, but they were more expressive than the easterners.<br/>
When I saw people eating my food happily and saying 「delicious」, my heart would sway with them.<br/>
「Ahh, this is too delicious! Hey, will you be opening your stall at this time tomorrow?」<br/>
「Yes. We will be open for at least eight more days.」<br/>
「I see. We will stay in this town until next month’s end. I will visit every day.」<br/>
「Thank you! I will await your patronage!」<br/>
The southerners turned and left.<br/>
Seeing how grumpy Pops looked, Arudas bumped Pop’s shoulder with his fist.<br/>
「Pops, let’s go. It’s almost time for work.」<br/>
However, Pops still wouldn’t move. He called out to me with a scary expression.<br/>
「Hey, your tarapa is good, I will be willing to pay if you use kimyusu or karon meat instead.」<br/>
「… I’m sorry, but I don’t plan to use anything other than kiba meat for now. But I will introduce a new kiba dish in the future…」<br/>
「As long as you use kiba meat, that will just be a waste of effort.」<br/>
Pops left after uttering these words.<br/>
Then— I quietly shifted my gaze and found the cloaked group standing in the same place without moving.<br/>
The young silver haired man standing at the front of the group walked over briskly.<br/>
「They claim, kiba taste bad, strange. I think, delicious.」<br/>
「Thank you. Please come again.」<br/>
「Every day, will come. Nine days, passed, stop business?」<br/>
「No. If possible, I hope to keep the stall running permanently.」<br/>
「I’m happy, you continue operate. We, every day come. We, entire blue month, stay here.」<br/>
Blue month— he probably meant the next month.<br/>
Kamyua did mention his work will begin on the fifteenth of the next month, so this month should be ending soon.<br/>
「I, leader of 《Silver Vase》 merchants, My name, Shumimaru Ji Sadumutino.」<br/>
「Ehh?」<br/>
「Shumimaru Ji Sadumutino. Your name, tell me?」<br/>
「Oh… I’m Asuta of the Fa house.」<br/>
「Asuta, thank you. I come every day.」<br/>
With these words, the Semu group left quickly.<br/>
「Incredible… Did you just sell ten and a few moments later four burgers…?」<br/>
Vena Wu stirred the sauce in the pot quietly and finally spoke.<br/>
「There are six left… We can sell them, right…?」<br/>
「That’s right, I’m really happy now.」<br/>
「… But, why do you look troubled…?」<br/>
「It’s nothing… I just feel vexed whenever someone says kiba tastes bad. The last time I heard that was Donda Wu claiming that hamburg steak is poison.」<br/>
「The people who think kiba tastes bad are the weird ones… Papa Donda just doesn’t like the soft texture of the hamburg steak. But from that man’s tone, he really thinks kiba tastes bad… There must be something wrong with his taste buds…」<br/>
「That’s not it. Everyone has their own preferences.」<br/>
After my duel with Donda Wu, I experienced this obvious fact.<br/>
The denizens of Forest’s Edge and the people of Semu probably only find it delicious because of the influence of their food culture.<br/>
I knew that very well.<br/>
But even so— my heart was still filled with a sense defeat.<br/>
I was depressed not because my pride as a chef was wounded, but because someone disparaged something I like, so my head was filled with childish frustration.<br/>
In that case, I should bury this feeling in the bottom of my heart… It’s strange, the southerners should be less biased than the westerners, but he still thinks that kiba meat is unpalatable. I must keep this in mind and think of a countermeasure later.<br/>
「Ah… Asuta, the vegetable peddler is here…」<br/>
「Ehh?」<br/>
I lifted my head and saw Uncle Dora and Tara walking towards us from the southern street.<br/>
I smiled with relief and suddenly felt troubled.<br/>
Two unfamiliar men were following behind Tara and him.<br/>
They both had yellowish brown skin and were about Dora’s age.<br/>
They wore a stiff smile, just like when Uncle Dora first met me.<br/>
「Hi Asuta, how’s it going?」<br/>
「Hello, business isn’t too bad today. I already sold 14 meals.」<br/>
「Ehh? Are you almost sold out?」<br/>
「There are six left. It’s still some time before noon, but I already got my hands full.」<br/>
「I see, that’s great. Sorry… but you provide samples, right? Can you let them try?」<br/>
After they stood before me, the faces of both men were tense from nervousness.<br/>
「Of course, if they don’t mind. I want everyone to try my cooking… And who are they?」<br/>
「They are my old friends. This guy over here runs a cloth stall, and that guy is a pot dealer.」<br/>
「Ah! Did I buy a pot from you before?」<br/>
「Y-Yes. You have a good memory.」<br/>
Most men in Genos had burly build, but the pot dealer was skinny, so he left a deep impression on me.<br/>
「They don’t believe that kiba meat is tasty, so I dragged them here. Can you let them try some?」<br/>
「Of course! Please wait a moment, I will heat it up.」<br/>
There just happened to be two samples left on the plate. After dipping it in the boiling hot sauce, I placed it on the plate again.<br/>
The pot dealer and the cloth stall owner seemed unsure if they wanted to cry or laugh. They looked at each other.<br/>
Tara didn’t care about them and kept tugging her father’s arm.<br/>
「Papa, I’m hungry…」<br/>
「Right. Asuta, give us one each, please.」<br/>
「Thank you. I’m really happy that you like it.」<br/>
「I’m… happy to be acquainted with someone from the Forest’s Edge too.」<br/>
Uncle Dora stole a glance at Vena Wu.<br/>
Vena Wu showed a troubled smile.<br/>
「We are all citizens of the west, but I can’t think of the Forest’s Edge denizens as fellow countrymen. When I see the terrifying figures of the men of Forest’s Edge, my knees will still go weak… But even so, I’m glad that there are kind people like you two in Forest’s Edge.」<br/>
Uncle Dora received the "Kiba burger" and showed his teeth in a smile.<br/>
「Do visit our stall again, I hope you can try the aria I grew.」<br/>
「… Yes, I will tell my house members…」<br/>
Dora bit into the "Kiba burger" with a gleeful smile.<br/>
「Oh… This "Kiba burger" tastes wonderful. Asuta, you actually made such a delicious meal from my vegetables, that fills me with bliss.」<br/>
「No, I can only serve great tasting food because the ingredients are fresh. Uncle Dora, I will be counting on your tarapa and aria in the future too.」<br/>
「I will be proud to serve.」<br/>
Uncle Dora turned towards his two friends.<br/>
「Well? How long are you going to just stand there? You even left your work behind to come here, so at least try the samples.」<br/>
「Y-You are the one who dragged us forcefully here.」<br/>
The pot dealer chided Uncle Dora and finally reached for the sample kiba meat.<br/>
With his slightly trembling fingers, he grabbed the toothpick and send the small piece of meat into his mouth.<br/>
「H-How is it?」<br/>
The cloth stall uncle grabbed his arm.<br/>
「Delicious… No, the taste is strange…」<br/>
「Ah, I minced the meat, kneaded them into a round patty, and then grilled it. So the texture is a bit unique.」<br/>
The pot dealer’s eyes started to waver.<br/>
Then, as if he had made up his mind, he reached his thin fingers into his shirt.<br/>
「I-I want one! I need to eat some more to understand its taste.」<br/>
「Okay! Thank you.」<br/>
「H-Hey, are you serious…?」<br/>
The cloth stall owner took the toothpick too.<br/>
「Uwah, it’s actually this good!」<br/>
He opened his eyes wide in surprise, and carefully studied the content of the pot.<br/>
「Is this really kiba meat…? The tarapa is amazing too!」<br/>
「Of course, this tarapa was grown by me.」<br/>
The cloth stall owner smiled when he saw Uncle Dora puff his chest proudly:<br/>
「Why are you acting so smug? A-Alright, I will buy one too…! I-I want to ask, will I grow horns, and will my skin turn black if I eat this…?」<br/>
「Do you still believe such superstitions? I have never seen horned denizens of Forest’s Edge before. My grandmother said that their appearance hasn’t changed since they migrated here from the southern jungles.」<br/>
「I-I get it! Give me one!」<br/>
「… Thank you.」<br/>
I could finally thank him sincerely.<br/>
When I heard people talking badly about kiba, my mood would go sour; when I heard people praising kiba, I would feel elated. My emotions swung because of the comments by others, proving that I was just a half-baked chef after all.<br/>
No matter what, the fight was just beginning.<br/>
Starting from tomorrow, I will prepare 40 "Kiba burgers".<br/>
It was much earlier than I expected, but due to the sales of the burger rising to this extent, it was about time to prepare a menu.<br/>
There were countless problems that I needed to work through.<br/>
After a moment, Kamyua Yost appeared like a spirit, bought a share for himself and Leito, and we were sold out in less than an hour of operation.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
6<br/>
The next day.<br/>
It was the dusk of the third day since my stall opened.<br/>
I laid sprawled out in the main room of the Fa house. Someone knocked the door twice.<br/>
「Asuta, it’s me.」<br/>
Ai Fa’s voice came inside of the room.<br/>
I was indescribably tired, but I still got up from the rug, walked to the entrance and took down the door bar.<br/>
When I opened the door, my beloved house head I hadn’t seen for half a day lashed out:<br/>
「Why are you showing such a good-for-nothing face? No one patronized your stall today? Even if that is the case, you don’t need to make such a face, it irks me just to look at you.」<br/>
「Ugghhh, what about you? How’s the situation? Did the number of kiba decrease at all?」<br/>
「I got a kiba. But it suffered too many unnecessary wounds, so I couldn’t blood let it successfully.」<br/>
「I see. Thank you for your hard work, it’s great that you’re not hurt…」<br/>
「Just why are you showing such a face? You better stop that, or I will really get angry.」<br/>
「Leave me alone, I’m just a little tired. If I’m with you, I will cheer up in no time…」<br/>
「Don’t joke with me. Your face is spoiling my mood, cheer up right now.」<br/>
My house head was merciless.<br/>
「Just what happened? You look so sullen, there must be a reason, right?」<br/>
「I don’t know if this is a valid reason… But I was taken away by the guards today.」<br/>
「What?! What happened?」<br/>
Ai Fa suddenly grabbed me by the chest.<br/>
「What kind of trouble did you get into? I thought you were working seriously?」<br/>
「And I was! I sold all 40 burgers because of my serious attitude…! But that is also why I got taken by the guards.」<br/>
「… I’m still confused. Tell me the reason, quick.」<br/>
She unhanded me, hung her cape on the wall and leaned the sabre against the wall.<br/>
My eyes followed her figure as she sat down beside the stove.<br/>
「When I opened the stall today, the southerners and easterners were all crowded there. All twenty burgers I prepared were sold in no time.」<br/>
「Yes.」<br/>
「I prepared additional ingredients today. When I made twenty more burgers, Tara came and bought four burgers for Uncle Dora and friends.」<br/>
「Yes.」<br/>
「So there were 16 left… At this moment, the 《Silver Vase》 merchants and a group of Jaguar people appeared at the same time, with ten people in each group.」<br/>
「Hmm? Didn’t they visit before the shop opened?」<br/>
「No. The customers who visited early in the morning were all unfamiliar faces. They came to shop due to the recommendations of these two groups. To avoid seeing each other, people from these two nationalities have different inns they usually lodge in. "Kiba burgers" became a hot topic in those inns.」<br/>
「…Yes.」<br/>
「We only had 16 burgers, but each group had ten customers. I had no choice but to sell ten burgers to the 《Silver Vase》 who came slightly earlier. When I told the southerner customers:"I’m sorry, there are only six burgers left", they started making a scene and demanded me to divide the 16 burgers between the two groups evenly.」<br/>
「Yes.」<br/>
「But the easterners wouldn’t budge… Since I failed to quell the commotion, a passerby alerted the guards.」<br/>
「Is that so, then the guards had to punish the ones who started the unrest.」<br/>
「Yes~ But they didn’t do that. In the end, the guards thought I’m the one at fault, and must take full responsibility. I was almost barred from entering the Post Station Town ever again.」<br/>
「… Did they reach that conclusion in accordance with the rules of the city?」<br/>
Rage was flickering in Ai Fa’s eyes.<br/>
「I-I’m not sure. But don’t worry, I already convinced them to let me off. It was my negligence for not preparing an adequate amount of food… I have already reflected on that.」<br/>
「That… is a difficult problem.」<br/>
Ai Fa gently shook her head, with her anger extinguished.<br/>
「It must be hard on you— Asuta, I’m hungry.」<br/>
「… House head, you are really cruel to me…」<br/>
「I did comfort you. I know why you are so exhausted… Alright then, stop being depressed and cheer up.」<br/>
Was my expression really that sullen? I pinched my cheeks with my hands.<br/>
I used up all my stamina and wits in the guard room before I was released, and my energy was completely used up.<br/>
I needed to consume nourishment during times like this.<br/>
「Okay! I will start preparing dinner!」<br/>
「… I want you to cheer up, not be overly cheerful.」<br/>
I see.<br/>
I added wood into the stove obediently and heated the soup I had already cooked.<br/>
「This is the third day since you started selling "Kiba burgers", and you have already sold 40 of them in one day, isn’t that an amazing accomplishment?」<br/>
Ai Fa sat with crossed legs beside the stove with one knee up. She asked quizzically.<br/>
「But you don’t look happy at all?」<br/>
「Of course I’m happy that sales were beyond my imagination. But I can’t afford to be happy, my position is already precarious.」<br/>
「Precarious?」<br/>
「Our main objective is to let the people in the Post Station Town understand how delicious kiba is, correct? So far, only four Genos locals have tasted the "Kiba burger". The easterners and southerners held the "Kiba burger" in high regards, but they will leave the Post Station Town after some time. Even if we earned some petty cash, we still can’t achieve our goal.」<br/>
After being interrogated by the guards, I finally learned the identity of my customers.<br/>
Like what the Semu group informed me before, they belonged to the merchant group 《Silver Vase》. They hailed from their home nation in the east with precious metals and other merchandise, and visited the city in the west and north, spending a year traveling and conducting business.<br/>
The Jaguar group were famed architects, and many of the buildings in the Post Station Town were erected by their hands.<br/>
Pops, the one who rejected the kiba meat completely, was the boss, and this just happened to be the time for their annual visit to the Post Station Town to repair the aging buildings.<br/>
「Next month, the 《Silver Vase》 and the architects will leave the Post Station Town. Ninety percent of the customers who bought a "Kiba burger" were travelers passing by Genos, or were here for odd jobs or labor, and not local residents. Very few Genos locals actually tried our burgers.」<br/>
「But— you wanted to promote the "Kiba burger" to the southerners and easterners in the first place, right?」<br/>
「That is true. But before the cooking can spread by word of mouth, all that will be for naught if I get taken away by the guards again. If there is another commotion, I will really be barred from entering the Post Station Town… My situation is precarious after all.」<br/>
The icy gazes of the guards and Milano Mast were engraved deeply in my heart.<br/>
Their eyes seemed to be saying:「Denizens from Forest’s Edge are abnormal after all and will just disturb the peace in the town.」<br/>
That was illogical. If we weren’t denizens of Forest’s Edge, we wouldn’t be treated so harshly.<br/>
However, we were denizens of Forest’s Edge, and we had set our mind on running a business in enemy territory.<br/>
I couldn’t afford to fail again.<br/>
The enemy in this battle was the entire Post Station Town, I learned this fact once again.<br/>
「… You have finally reverted to your usual expression.」<br/>
Ai Fa’s voice was very close to me.<br/>
I turned my head in surprise and found her right beside me.<br/>
「Asuta, I didn’t know you are so greedy.」<br/>
「G-Greedy?」<br/>
「How much copper plates have you earned in these three days?」<br/>
「Hmm? I sold seventy meals in three days, so that’s 140 red copper plates. Minus the set-up cost, three days of labor and ingredient cost, the profit is 77 red copper plates.」<br/>
「So that’s like hunting more than 6 kiba in just three days?」<br/>
「You can’t compare it like this. No matter how many copper plates I make, the number of kiba will not go down. My work can’t be compared to that of a hunter.」<br/>
By the way— my target was to sell at least 60 portions in the first ten days.<br/>
I never thought that I would reach this goal in just three days.<br/>
As I was stirring the soup, Ai Fa smiled beside me.<br/>
「This is how the denizens of Forest’s Edge think. The people in the city also worked hard to earn copper plates, right?」<br/>
「Our objective isn’t earning money anyway. I’m glad that we can buy new pots and knives with the copper plates though.」<br/>
「… You are really greedy.」<br/>
Ai Fa said with a laugh. A calming light could be seen in her eyes.<br/>
But I still felt unhappy.<br/>
「Why would you think that? Because I don’t look happy about the sales exceeding my expectations? I don’t think I’m a greedy person.」<br/>
「Not that. You don’t care about how many copper plates we earned and strive single-mindedly at our primary goal. I think you are a man who pursues success greedily.」<br/>
「… In that case, you should describe me with the term "ambitious". Being greedy sounds terrible.」<br/>
I complained as I stirred the pot that was slowly heating up, Ai Fa replied 「I understand」, then walked to me.<br/>
She reached for my head. I already took off the towel on my head, so she ruffled my hair directly and lean her face towards me.<br/>
「Asuta, you are really ambitious.」<br/>
She showed a mischievous smile, and her white teeth were visible.<br/>
It was rare to see Ai Fa showing such a smile, which reminded me of Ludo Wu.<br/>
On top of that, she usually didn’t show such an obvious smile, so that surprised me.<br/>
「… Asuta, I’m hungry.」<br/>
「Oh right. The soup is heated up. I will grill the meat; can you help me carry the pot over?」<br/>
I just cooked the kiba soup earlier. The pot was still hot and there was only two person’s worth of soup, so it got heated up in no time.<br/>
There was a board behind the stove, and we moved the pot onto it. I put the new pot on the stove, took out the plates full of food. Ai Fa looked at the content curiously.<br/>
「What are we having for dinner? There is an unfamiliar scent.」<br/>
「That’s right, I bought a new ingredient today. Well, actually, it’s some kind of spice.」<br/>
The kiba abdomen meat was inside the plate, soaking in a red marinating sauce.<br/>
That was a sauce I made from fruit wine, diced aria, and the new ingredient, myam.<br/>
「Is it Myam?」<br/>
「Yes, Myam. Remember the kimyusu meat bun I ate? Myam was added to it.」<br/>
This herb had the fragrance of garlic and coriander. It had a complicated aroma that roused one’s appetite.<br/>
Myam had green straw-like stems and was really spicy when eaten raw. After cutting it together with aria into a pulp I added it to the marinating sauce.<br/>
「I had always been curious about this ingredient, but I didn’t know its name. After asking Uncle Dora, I finally figured it out. Myam is suitable to be added to the tarapa sauce.」<br/>
I explained to Ai Fa as I fried the thin slices of an aria.<br/>
After the aria turned soft, I spread out the marinated meat and put them into the pot.<br/>
The next instant, the room was filled with the fragrance of fruit wine and Myam.<br/>
「How is it? You don’t hate this fragrance, right?」<br/>
「… I feel even hungrier now.」<br/>
I know, right? I didn’t know coriander very well, but I thought the fragrance of garlic and grilled meat was the best stimulant of one’s appetite.<br/>
In my old world, there were many people who disliked such a strong smell. But Myam was different from garlic and eating it wouldn’t give you bad breath. Women and children also liked kimyusu meat bun after all. Hence, I decided to use this stimulating spice in my cooking.<br/>
By the way, this spice had to be bought at the stall that sells rock salt and dry goods, and not the vegetable stalls. I have never seen this ingredient in the Wu food store either.<br/>
「Okay, the meat surface is seared, I’m adding it in.」<br/>
I poured the rest of the marinating sauce into the pot.<br/>
This dish was cooked the same way as ginger-roasted meat.<br/>
Should I dub it "Myam-roasted kiba meat"? I thought to myself quietly.<br/>
「Asuta.」<br/>
「Hmm?」<br/>
「I’m hungry.」<br/>
「Hmm, that’s the fourth time you said that. It’s already done, please wait a moment.」<br/>
When the kiba was completely cooked, I scooped the meat and aria onto the plate.<br/>
The kiba meat was sprinkled with rock salt and pico leaves, so it didn’t need any more seasoning.<br/>
After drying the sauce remaining in the pan a little, I poured it onto the meat and aria, and it was done!<br/>
「Ah, the grilled poitan is in the food store. Sorry, can you help me get the kiba soup?」<br/>
「Yes.」<br/>
I hurried to the food store, then carried the poitan I grilled in the morning and the tino shreds I just chopped onto the dining table.<br/>
「This is the raw tino used in kiba burger, right?」<br/>
「Yes, I think it will suit this dish very well.」<br/>
The ginger-roasted meat had to be paired with cabbage shreds.<br/>
So "Myam-roasted meat" and tino shreds should go together well too.<br/>
However, that was what I thought as someone who grew up in another world, I wonder if the people in this world would feel the same.<br/>
「Alright! Let’s dig in.」<br/>
「…Asuta, there isn’t much meat on your plate.」<br/>
「Ah, right, I was comparing the ratio of aria and myam and adjusting the marinating time. I ate plenty of meat during my sampling sessions, so this much is enough.」<br/>
Ai Fa was surprised.<br/>
「You spent so much effort on developing this dish…? Are you planning to sell this in the Post Station Town?」<br/>
「Oh! You have keen senses. That’s right, making more than 40 "Kiba burgers" takes too much effort, so I have decided to start selling this dish tomorrow. Let me explain how to eat it.」<br/>
I grilled the poitan thinner than the one used in "Kiba burger", spread a layer of tino shreds, added the meat and aria, and rolled it up from below like a crepe. And the "Myam-roasted meat" was done.<br/>
「Ai Fa, we are having dinner, so you have to eat too. I will use the rest of the aria to make soup, so don’t leave anything behind.」<br/>
「… Denizens of Forest’s Edge don’t leave leftovers.」<br/>
「Yes. I just wanted to try saying that line. Here, eat this.」<br/>
Ai Fa nodded, and after saying grace, she picked up the "Myam-roasted meat".<br/>
When she noticed my gaze, she frowned a little.<br/>
「… Don’t stare at me.」<br/>
「Oh right, my bad. I’m just curious about your reaction.」<br/>
「Hmmp.」<br/>
Ai Fa turned her face away and bit into the "Myam roast meat".<br/>
She grabbed the grilled poitan with both hands. She looked adorable while doing this.<br/>
Leaving that aside— how’s the taste?<br/>
In my opinion, it wasn’t too bad.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
There weren’t any ginger, cooking wine and soy sauce in this world, so I didn’t expect the dish to taste like meat grilled with ginger. The kiba meat was soaked in sweet fruit wine and spicy Myam, giving it a sweet and spicy taste after it was grilled. It was suitable to be eaten together with tino and grilled poitan.<br/>
The meat was less than 5mm thick and required thorough biting. If I messed up the heat, the people in the city wouldn’t be able to bite into it, so I had to be careful about that.<br/>
「How’s the taste?」<br/>
I asked Ai Fa for her comment as I made a wrap for myself.<br/>
「Delicious.」<br/>
Ai Fa’s answer was curt as usual.<br/>
No matter how the food tasted, Ai Fa didn’t use too many words to express her opinion. I had no way of making her speak her mind more—<br/>
「This dish has a great fragrance, and the overall seasoning suits the kiba meat well. It’s as tasty as eating steak… Does steak match this kind of seasoning too?」<br/>
It was rare for her to give such a specific comment.<br/>
「But… steaks probably don’t match the sweet taste that well. I don’t want you to season the hamburg steak this way either. As for the Kiba burger and tarapa… I’m not too sure about that.」<br/>
「I-I see. Amazing, this is the first time you gave me such detailed feedback.」<br/>
And I agreed with all the points she raised.<br/>
Ai Fa closed her eyes again, as if she was searching for the appropriate words.<br/>
「Also… this is delicious, but my throat is parched after eating it. If… the seasoning is not so strong, I think it will taste better.」<br/>
「I see. After all, the denizens of Forest’s Edge don’t use any seasonings aside from rock salt when making jerky. The taste is probably too strong for you. Sorry, I will adjust the seasoning time when I cook dinner next time.」<br/>
Ai Fa sighed a little tiredly, then stared at me again.<br/>
「… That’s all I have to say. Don’t ask me more questions, my head will hurt if I think anymore.」<br/>
「I got it. Thank you! Your comments are a valuable source of reference to me.」<br/>
「… Didn’t you already decide to sell normal grilled meat after the kiba burger? You mentioned that only those dishes can bring out the tastiness of kiba.」<br/>
「Yes, I did plan to do that.」<br/>
I sat down properly again.<br/>
「I told you already, right? When I let my customers try the hamburg steaks yesterday, they didn’t complain about its soft texture, but the unique taste of the kiba meat itself. That’s why I’m trying such a seasoning and flavor. I want to find a way to suppress the unique taste of kiba without destroying its deliciousness.」<br/>
「Yes.」<br/>
「There were as many southern customers as eastern customers today. They probably came after hearing others discussing the tastiness of kiba. No one complained to me about the taste directly, but there had to be some who felt dissatisfied. If I’m unlucky, maybe half of them won’t like my cooking.」<br/>
Besides, the easterners were always expressionless and silent. I couldn’t tell how many of them were actually happy with the food I was serving.<br/>
My patrons were increasing, but I didn’t know how many repeat customers the stall will have. Furthermore, not only did the easterners have similar appearances, they often concealed their face with a hood, making it harder for me to tell them apart.<br/>
「Anyways, even if I used the strong tasting tarapa in the "Kiba burger", there are still customers who dislike the unique taste of the kiba. Instead of steaks where the taste of the meat is the main accent, I think we should present a dish that suppresses the kiba’s unique taste. Since the salted meat I tasted in the 《Kimyusu’s Tail Inn》 was very salty, the townspeople are probably alright with strong seasonings.」<br/>
「… Hmm. You already thought that far.」<br/>
Ai Fa quickly finished the first "Myam-roasted meat" and stared at me.<br/>
「Then, why were you so depressed just now?」<br/>
「Hmm? I was just tired. I still need to finish this dish quickly after that commotion in the afternoon. And there are also many things for me to consider.」<br/>
I started making another "Myam-roasted meat" for Ai Fa, and leaned towards her.<br/>
「Ai Fa, I didn’t expect my stocks to run out just by selling to the southerners and easterners. I have decided to supplement the "Kiba burger" with this new dish tomorrow, but that won’t solve the root of the issue.」<br/>
「… Hmm?」<br/>
「We only have one cart right now, so I have to wait until the "Kiba burger" sells out, and then start selling "Myam-roasted meat". But that would make having two different dishes meaningless… It’s earlier than I predicted, but I’m seriously considering renting one more cart.」<br/>
Ai Fa accepted the "Myam-roasted meat", then nodded seriously.<br/>
「If that’s what you think, then give it a try. I trust your judgment.」<br/>
「This is an important thing, right? If we increase the number of stalls and helpers, our expenses will go up too—」<br/>
「But you think this is a shortcut towards success, right?」<br/>
Ai Fa looked at me quietly.<br/>
「I trust your judgment. Don’t make me say that so many times.」<br/>
「… I understand. Thank you.」<br/>
After nodding firmly, a serene smile suddenly appeared on Ai Fa’s face.<br/>
「… You are really a greedy man.」<br/>
「Like I told you, greedy is—」<br/>
「You are an ambitious man.」<br/>
Since she changed her phrasing, I didn’t need to refute her.<br/>
Because of my inadequate planning, the results in these three days weren’t as good as I hoped.<br/>
If my judgment was wrong, the entire plan would fail. I learned that from the commotion that happened today.<br/>
The southerners and easterners bought all my food, and the westerners didn’t get to taste my cooking. It was rather strange to be troubled by something like this.<br/>
If business was good for the first ten days, I will introduce a new dish. That was the original plan, but I couldn’t afford to take it so easy. Demand had outstripped supply on the third day of the opening, so I had to solve this issue fast.<br/>
I already shared my thoughts with Vena Wu.<br/>
Once Donda Wu permits, the Wu clan could send me new helpers from the day after tomorrow.<br/>
If I could make it through tomorrow, I would be able to fight back the next day.<br/>
「Alright! Time for round two!」<br/>
「What is a "raundo"?」<br/>
I turned back when I heard Ai Fa’s voice. She was sitting with one knee up, resting her arm on her knee and supporting her chin, staring at me.<br/>
「Ehh? Ai Fa, you are already done?」<br/>
「You are too slow. You still have work to do later, right? If you don’t act faster, you will lose out on sleep!」<br/>
「Don’t worry. I already used the excess time to knead the "Kiba burger’s" patty. I just need to cut the meat slices for the "Myam-roasted meat"and make the tarapa sauce, just trivial stuff. Grilling the poitan tomorrow morning is the hardest part.」<br/>
「……」<br/>
「Hmm? What’s the matter?」<br/>
「… I thought I will be the only one to benefit if you stay in the Fa house. That’s why it’s better for you to stay in the house Lutim.」<br/>
「W-What are you saying? Y-You’re not chasing me out, right?」<br/>
「Do you think I will say that now?」<br/>
Ai Fa’s gaze was calm and steady.<br/>
I sipped the cold soup and scratched my head.<br/>
「Then why bring that up? Don’t make me feel uneasy!」<br/>
「I’m glad that you want to stay in the Fa house… I’m also happy that you found a job that utilizes your strength even though you are staying in the Fa house.」<br/>
Ai Fa crawled towards me as she said that.<br/>
She ruffled my hair.<br/>
When I patted her head last time, she punched my solar plexus. But she was doing something so intimate without any hesitation.<br/>
「Y-You know, whenever you do that, I feel like I’m treated like a child.」<br/>
「Is that so? My father Gill always did this whenever he praised me.」<br/>
It had been a while since I saw her pout.<br/>
「Ah, it doesn’t make me uncomfortable, I just feel a little embarrassed.」<br/>
「… I see.」<br/>
Ai Fa lowered her eyelids.<br/>
Did I say too much? I started reflecting on myself.<br/>
The next moment—<br/>
Ai Fa knelt on one knee slowly and hugged my head with both arms suddenly.<br/>
Ai Fa’s body warmth, fragrance, and strength engulfed my body and soul.<br/>
「I’m so happy that I didn’t lose you that night… I’m so happy you chose the Fa house.」<br/>
「Ai…  A-A-Ai Fa?」<br/>
My voice was breaking from surprise.<br/>
She hugged me with all her might, her soft hair brushed against my cheeks.<br/>
My heart almost stopped.<br/>
There was a rainbow color glow in her eyes.<br/>
If this continued for a few more seconds, a nerve inside me might just break— as I was thinking about that, her warmth, strength, and fragrance suddenly left me.<br/>
Ai Fa sat down again and rubbed her nose childishly.<br/>
「… That’s how I feel now.」<br/>
「D-Don’t… scare me like that.」<br/>
I collapsed onto the floor and had to prop myself up with my arms.<br/>
「Y-Your father is really passionate, right?」<br/>
「Hmm? What’s that about father Gill?」<br/>
「Ehh?」<br/>
「I’m doing this because I want to, it has nothing to do with him.」<br/>
「……」<br/>
「If my actions irked you, I will be more careful in the future. But I can’t hold back my emotions… Sorry for interrupting your meal. Eat up, I feel sleepy.」<br/>
After saying this nonchalantly, Ai Fa pointed at my plate.<br/>
This girl… is a million times worse than Vena Wu!<br/>
Ai Fa didn’t notice me screaming in my heart and put her head down.<br/>
「I think you already accomplished a lot. Since you don’t think so, then work doubly hard… I told you before that you may use the copper plates you earned as you wish. Tell me if you don’t have enough.」<br/>
「… Can I really believe your words? What if I buy a new hair accessory for you?」<br/>
「I will beat you up.」<br/>
「I see… I get it! I will decide if I should expand to two stalls depending on the sales tomorrow! So, don’t regret it, okay?」<br/>
「Why are you suddenly so angry?」<br/>
Ai Fa who had let her hair down leaned in immediately.<br/>
「… So, did I make you unhappy?」<br/>
She still looked a little dissatisfied and uneased.<br/>
I still didn’t start eating and sighed heavily.<br/>
「I’m not angry. Sorry…」<br/>
「… You really are a strange man.」<br/>
I wasn’t strange at all.<br/>
However, I couldn’t refute her when I saw Ai Fa’s relieved smile.<br/>
No matter what— our war was just beginning.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
