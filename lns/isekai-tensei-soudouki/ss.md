Side Story – A Commotion From Love<br/>
.<br/>
Part 1<br/>
「MidshipReturn the wheel to the center! It’s a match of crossing up! Hurry!」<br/>
「Sorry, but you’re too slow!」<br/>
The two ships looked like they were sailing side by side, but the left ship was ahead just slightly.<br/>
That was to say, Kailas was going to win in this challenge from Urraca.<br/>
「Tsk! I’m a step slower!」<br/>
「I still can’t let myself get beaten by the young miss. Even like this, I still have more experience.」<br/>
Kailas thought that if it was just a matter of talent, then Urraca was superior, though.<br/>
However, in a secluded space like the sea, experience was also an important aspect.<br/>
If a sailor indulged themselves in their own talent and made light of experience, the sea god would bring down the judgment of death on that hubris in most cases.<br/>
For Kailas, Urraca was also a boss that was hard to obtain. Currently, there was nobody else besides him in Majorca Kingdom who could teach her the importance of experience.<br/>
The sailing race went around four buoys floating in the sea. The race was closed at the goal post with a splendid victory for Kailas.<br/>
「……I can’t wrap my head around it. Even though our technique should be the same, why is it I’m the only one who keeps losing-」<br/>
「Young miss will be angry if I teach you the answer, won’t you?」<br/>
「Obviously–!」<br/>
Urraca threw out her chest with a rough huff from indignation.<br/>
Her large breasts that were like ripened watermelons jiggled. It was a stunning sight.<br/>
Kailas’s gaze was taken by that sight, even though he didn’t intend to. He was speechless.<br/>
To be honest, ever since he was apprehended at Akaba, he had some feelings towards Urraca.<br/>
「Can I ask for anything for the prize?」<br/>
「Hm? If it’s something I can provide.」<br/>
「Then……can young miss go out with me for the whole day on the next holiday?」<br/>
「──What?」<br/>
Urraca was bewildered by Kailas’s completely unexpected words.<br/>
Of course, it wasn’t just Urraca who was bewildered. The men who had been Urraca’s subordinates for many years including the vice captain Orba were all waiting for Urraca’s reply.<br/>
Everyone was aware that since Urraca failed in her confession to Baldr the other day, she hadn’t yet recovered her liveliness.<br/>
They honestly wished that this could at least become an impetus for Urraca to get back on her feet.<br/>
Of course, Kailas himself was fully intending to take advantage of Urraca’s current state that was in heartbreak.<br/>
「Well, it might be good enough for a diversion……」<br/>
At that moment, Urraca’s first date with a man was decided.<br/>
.<br/>
For Urraca, her memory of the night she spent with Baldr was a bitter memory even now.<br/>
(Just what was lacking from me……)<br/>
The answer to that question was everything. But Urraca wasn’t mature enough right now to be able to realize that.<br/>
Or rather, she was on the level of ‘is it alright for you to be in such a maidenly mentality at your age?’, so she was only getting toyed around by Maria easily.<br/>
Even so, her chest would feel constricted with a sweet throbbing when Baldr entered her mind. Perhaps it could be said that she was growing up splendidly just from that.<br/>
「Women are all about sex appeal! There is no man that won’t waver in front of sex appeal!」<br/>
This was Maria’s claim.<br/>
That was why Urraca did her best despite her shyness.<br/>
Despite her lack of interest towards men, even Urraca could at least feel shy just like a normal person.<br/>
However it seemed Baldr was a bit different of a man even for even a veteran like Maria.<br/>
「I can’t believe how wrong I was……I thought because he has a fiancée that he has done at least some things……」<br/>
It seemed a man who wasn’t used to humans would cringe instead at a push that was done excessively.<br/>
In that case, her effort that she was doing shyly at that time was simply pointless. Urraca had shamed herself for nothing, no, not even for nothing, it was for the worse instead.<br/>
「Against this kind of man, the best plan is……shyness!」<br/>
There was a part of her that questioned herself whether it was alright to keep listening to Maria’s advice like this, but it was also a fact that Urraca had nobody else she could consult with other than Maria.<br/>
The invitation from Kailas came just at the right timing.<br/>
「──Guess I’ll give it a try.」<br/>
Just as her personality suggested, Urraca was someone who was decisive when making decisions.<br/>
.<br/>
Part 2<br/>
The fountain of Parma──it was a place that was often used by lovers for a rendezvous……but the attention to couples today wasn’t ordinary.<br/>
Urraca was wearing a light blue blouse and a skirt with a checkered pattern, but because she was making a despondent face looking like she was waiting for someone, men who came talking to her immediately appeared one after another.<br/>
Those men also surely never even imagined that the beauty before their eyes was that famous Tormenta Negra herself.<br/>
「I’m sorry, I’m waiting for someone else so……」<br/>
Normally this was where she would punch those men flying without any hesitation, but Urraca endured it while her fortitude was being heavily tested.<br/>
「You should just abandon a man who would let a beauty like you waiting!」<br/>
「I-I know a good restaurant that isn’t really well-known around here!」<br/>
「──These guys, are they your acquaintances, young miss?」<br/>
Kailas arrived at the rendezvous place with a perplexed face. He was puzzled seeing the crowd that was formed around Urraca.<br/>
The usual Urraca would undoubtedly snap and rampage already in this situation.<br/>
But in contrast to that thought of Kailas, Urraca’s reaction greatly betrayed his expectation.<br/>
Her expression brightened sweetly, then right after that she looked down shyly and clutched at Kailas’s sleeve slowly.<br/>
Anyone who saw this scene would think they were looking at a pair of innocent lovers.<br/>
──Only if those people didn’t know the actual Urraca though.<br/>
Kailas’s brawny body that was tanned under the sea sun and Urraca’s chaste beauty looked very unbalanced when paired together. The men who were surrounding Urraca were immediately enraged.<br/>
From their perspective, it only looked like Kailas was threatening Urraca to go out with him.<br/>
「Oi-! Old man, say your prayer to your maker!」<br/>
However Kailas was a man who was the big boss of a pirate group not a long time ago.<br/>
His boiling point was actually lower than even Urraca.<br/>
「Who are you calling old man, huh! I’m still 42!」<br/>
「No, that’s what you call an old man──」<br/>
「I ain’t an old man! I said I’m not!」<br/>
No matter the era, the mental state of a man in his forties would always be complicated.<br/>
There was no way the city hoodlums could do anything against a veteran marine like Kailas.<br/>
It didn’t even take a minute before the street was filled with bodies lying spread-eagled everywhere.<br/>
「……Kailas-san, you’re really strong.」<br/>
Urraca smiled in admiration at Kailas. It made Kailas yell with his eyes widened like saucers.<br/>
「Are you really okay? Did you perhaps drink something bad……」<br/>
It was here that Urraca’s hell crashed on the forehead of Kailas who was plainly suspecting Urraca’s odd behavior.<br/>
Actually, this man called Kailas was an eccentric who had never gone out with a woman even once until now. In other words, these two were quite similar to one other.<br/>
.<br/>
Even though such a thing happened, the two of them conveniently treated it like it never happened. Urraca started walking while cuddling close to Kailas’s side.<br/>
「And, where are you going to take me to?」<br/>
「A, aa……I heard that recently there is a café opened by someone who studied at Mauricia……」<br/>
Kailas was seriously considering taking Urraca to a doctor to check her head, but he rethought it thinking that it was the pain of heartbreak that was making Urraca like this.<br/>
In that case, healing Urraca’s heartbreak was the mission that was imposed on him. Yes, there was no doubt about it!<br/>
.<br/>
「It’s here! Apparently you can eat something novel here.」<br/>
Kailas said that while pointing at the branch store of Olive Brown Café that was selling castella at Mauricia Kingdom.<br/>
The manager of this branch café was born in Majorca. It seemed he decided to take the plunge and open this café in order to quickly popularize this new cuisine.<br/>
「Hou……! So this is what they called castella!」<br/>
The castella was brought to them after waiting thirty minutes. Even Kailas, who didn’t particularly like sweet things, could be seen with sparkling eyes.<br/>
And then when he reached with his fork to immediately taste it…….<br/>
「Kyah!」<br/>
The hand of Urraca who was also reaching toward the castella at the same time bumped with Kailas’s hand.<br/>
Her face blushed bright red, then Urraca sent an upward gaze at Kailas with her hand still touching his hand. She kept sending him brief glances.<br/>
「I-I’m sorry, I……」<br/>
「N-no……don’t mind it! Let’s eat this right away!」<br/>
Kailas was wailing inside his heart seeing Urraca’s feverish gaze.<br/>
(This…….she became this frail……! That Mauricia brat, he better prepare himself to pay for this the next time we meet!)<br/>
Kailas brought the castella into his mouth while sniffling. Urraca stared at him in dissatisfaction.<br/>
.<br/>
After that, they went shopping and did things like gambling for diversion. Then for the finale, the two of them headed to a viewing platform.<br/>
It was a great date spot where lovers could watch the sunset together, but today the viewing platform was completely empty except for the two of them, even though usually it would be packed with couples.<br/>
It went without saying that behind this there was the secret maneuvering of sailors with scary faces.<br/>
「Kyah!」<br/>
Urraca who was starting to climb the stair of the viewing platform suddenly staggered. She ended up hugging Kailas’s back from behind.<br/>
Kailas was taken aback as though he had gotten electrified when he felt Urraca’s large breasts on his back.<br/>
However, it wasn’t gentlemanly to turn into a beast when facing a weak woman.<br/>
Kailas too was getting carried away for misunderstanding that he was a gentleman at this point of time, but if only he still had the leeway to calmly observe Urraca, he would surely notice the throbbing vein on her forehead.<br/>
If only his sense for danger was working normally, he would also notice how the voltage of the danger was also rising.<br/>
And then the climax.<br/>
In front of the sunset, after shyly hesitating many times, Urraca softly leaned on Kailas’s shoulder.<br/>
The warm body heat and the fragrance of flowers tickled Kailas’s nose.<br/>
And yet, Kailas didn’t even twitch.<br/>
.<br/>
(Wh-wh-what, what should I do!? Why is this guy not shaken at all? Would it be better if I hug him?)<br/>
Urraca was desperately thinking, but Kailas was simply unable to move because he was at his wits’ end.<br/>
.<br/>
*Snap!*<br/>
.<br/>
Inside Urraca, something was crumbling with a snapping sound.<br/>
「WH-WHO CAN DO SOMETHING LIKE THAAAAAAAAAAAAAATT!」<br/>
Urraca screamed while shaking her head wildly.<br/>
「Am I that lacking in charm? Is acting feminine really that unsuited for meeeee!」<br/>
A storm of fists flew wildly about.<br/>
「Aguh! Buberah!」<br/>
That isn’t true, Kailas wanted to insist, but Urraca who was losing her senses from rage didn’t allow Kailas to speak.<br/>
「Even though I’m wearing a skirt after so long! I’ll never believe what Maria says again–!」<br/>
No, you should notice that quicker.<br/>
If Baldr was here, he might mutter that.<br/>
Kailas didn’t know what the trigger for this was, but it seemed Urraca had returned to her normal self. Believing that, Kailas raised a thumbs up with the face of a man that had accomplished something.<br/>
「Hehehe……nice punch.」<br/>
「THAT’S THE ONLY THING YOU WANTED TO SAAAAAAAAAAYY!」<br/>
In the next moment, a spinning kick of rage kicked Kailas flying from the viewing platform towards the sea that was spreading below.<br/>
.<br/>
Part 3<br/>
「As I thought, petty tricks are just not me! Now that it came to this, I’ll make Baldr into my man even if I have to use brute force……」<br/>
In the future, Urraca was going to head to Mauricia fully equipped with aphrodisiac and sleeping drugs. It was said that there was also the figure of Majorca’s king among the people who were desperately holding her back.<br/>
It was impossible for Urraca’s subordinates to stop her once she made up her mind.<br/>
.<br/>
「DAMN IIIIIIIIIITTT! BALDR! I’LL NEVER GIVE UUUUUUUUPP!」<br/>
