15-14. Hero VS Demon Lord<br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
"Hero-sama, Seina-dono has returned."<br/>
<br/>
The small Seina who went ahead during our short break runs up to me.<br/>
The excessive fat on her breasts seems obstructive. It's a shame, she has a childish face and all.<br/>
<br/>
I think childish face looks better with super smooth flat line like of those little girl maids.<br/>
<br/>
"He's there, he wasn't wearing the thin turtle shell like before, it's silver metal armor now."<br/>
"He 『Transform』ed again...."<br/>
<br/>
I recalled how the demon lord was like the first time we met him.<br/>
The demon lord at that time looked like a ratkin person with purple fur you can see anywhere but with persecution complex.<br/>
<br/>
The moment he saw us, he screamed, made a strange pose, wore an insect animal suit and [Transform]ed with a purple muffler on his neck.<br/>
His level was only 55 when we first met, but it rose every time we fought him and his level the last time we fought was 62.<br/>
<br/>
It should've been far lower than my 71, but his [Transform]ed self was surprisingly strong.<br/>
We probably wouldn't have the advantage if he didn't have the limitation of quickly running out of gas and stopped moving.<br/>
<br/>
We lost our companions due to that carelessness though.<br/>
I don't wanna feel like that ever again.<br/>
<br/>
"But, is it alright to leave it to Satou-chi? Shouldn't I go instead?"<br/>
"It's alright, Satou should be able to do something about the Dungeon Master."<br/>
<br/>
I told Seina with confidence that has no basis.<br/>
That guy will be absolutely fine--he's a mysterious guy who oozes such atmosphere.<br/>
<br/>
It's frustrating, but I can entrust Honey to that guy.<br/>
<br/>
"I think Satou can do it somehow."<br/>
"It's rare for Wi to be that believing."<br/>
"Really?"<br/>
<br/>
The other girls don't seem to have any objection either.<br/>
<br/>
It was only Rin who said some siscon remark, "But, I still won't hand over Sera."<br/>
I've advised her that minding it too much would produce the opposite result, but it seems she loves her little sister too much she can't control herself.<br/>
<br/>
"We'll defeat the demon lord this time."<br/>
<br/>
Declaring so to my companions, I head toward the hall where the demon lord is waiting.<br/>
<br/>
There's only two demon lords left.<br/>
Nanashi reported that the demon lord on a different continent was destroyed by the Ancient Dragon's breath.<br/>
The only two left are the demon lord ahead and the demon lord in the ratkin country.<br/>
<br/>
I'm sorry for Nanashi, but I'll let him to handle the demon lord in the ratkin country that hasn't showed any sign at all.<br/>
<br/>
--Once I'm done with this fight and win against the demon lord, I'll go back to Japan. Japan where my little sister and my childhood friend are waiting.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
◇<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
--ＺＨＷＷＷＵＵＵＵＵＵＵＷＮ.<br/>
<br/>
The demon lord roared the moment we entered the hall, purple waves are running on top of his silver armor.<br/>
<br/>
"Hayato."<br/>
"Yeah, I know."<br/>
<br/>
I nod at Mary who looks anxious.<br/>
<br/>
"He's transforming! Let's stall for time until the effect expires."<br/>
<br/>
His appearance remains the same even after the effect expires, but he won't be in the overwhelming reinforced state anymore.<br/>
We're aiming for the time when the purple aura disappears.<br/>
<br/>
"It looks weak somehow."<br/>
"Doesn't that Unicorn-like horn look dangerous?"<br/>
"And he's hunching a bit, he probably attacks mainly by charging and stabbing with that horn."<br/>
<br/>
The girls are looking at the demon lord who's wearing (tokusatsu) hero-like costume, analyzing him.<br/>
I'm familiar with that appearance.<br/>
<br/>
"Rin, Wi, attack him with the Fire Bird Wand and arrows!"<br/>
<br/>
The two quickly attack as per my instruction.<br/>
<br/>
"Have you forgotten Hayato, attacks won't work on him during the transformation."<br/>
"Yeah, I know."<br/>
<br/>
While assenting Mary, I watch over the outcome of the attacks.<br/>
<br/>
"Ah, it was blocked."<br/>
"Is that the Flexible Shield of Force magic?"<br/>
"The shape looks strange."<br/>
<br/>
Just as I thought--.<br/>
<br/>
It's the worst kind among something with a unicorn-shaped horn that I know.<br/>
<br/>
"That's an absolute defense. I'll be the vanguard and restrain him. Do only attacks with knockback until its effect expires!"<br/>
"I'm going too."<br/>
"It'll be dangerous with only Hayato."<br/>
<br/>
Rusus and Fifi grinned and volunteered to help restrain the demon lord.<br/>
It's dangerous, but I'm honestly saved if the two are with me.<br/>
<br/>
"Let's see which's stronger, my great 『Divine Power (Unique Skills)』 or your 『Transform』."<br/>
<br/>
I activate my [Strongest Lance (Nothing cannot be Penetrated)], and [Invincible Shield (Nothing can Penetrate)], and close in the demon lord with Flickering Movement.<br/>
The assault rifle that the demon lord produced out of nowhere spouts fire.<br/>
<br/>
"Tsk, explosive bullets huh!"<br/>
<br/>
My Invincible Shield blocked the small explosions, but the shock still hit my body.<br/>
He must know the way to fight against someone with absolute defense too.<br/>
<br/>
"Heee~n, here here~"<br/>
<br/>
--ＺＨＷＵＵＵＷＮ.<br/>
<br/>
Provoked by Rusus, the demon lord averts his attention away from me.<br/>
The demon lord's stout arm grazed Rusus.<br/>
<br/>
"Ouch."<br/>
<br/>
Even though it only grazed her, Rusus's arm guard was blown off, fresh blood scattered in the air.<br/>
The demon lord shot Rusus to finish her, but she dodged the attack by using the terrain.<br/>
<br/>
"Rusus, get back."<br/>
"I'll leave it to you Fifi!"<br/>
<br/>
In Rusus's place who's fallen back to recover, this time it's Fifi's turn to restrain the demon lord while waiting for me.<br/>
<br/>
"Kept you waiting, Fifi."<br/>
"Ehen, I still can go on."<br/>
<br/>
I smile back at Fifi's fearless words and fling words filled with provocation skill at the demon lord.<br/>
<br/>
"Let's test who's stronger between you and the great me--<<Shining Strike Rush>>"<br/>
<br/>
My holy sword Arondight clad in blue light stabs at his octagonal shield.<br/>
Metallic and heavy sounds echo, blue and purple light are intensely scattering in the surroundings.<br/>
<br/>
The light splinters that went around the back of my shield burn my back, but I can't use the [Limitless Recovery] here yet.<br/>
Believing in Loreiya and the others healing magic, I concentrate at the demon lord in front of me.<br/>
<br/>
"WOOOOOOOOOOOO!"<br/>
<br/>
--ＺＨＷＷＷＵＵＵＵＵＵＵＷＮ.<br/>
<br/>
Not losing to my yell filled with fighting spirit, the demon lord roared deafeningly.<br/>
Responding to our shouts, intense light of blue and purple dyed the surroundings.<br/>
<br/>
The magic power and after-waves that fill the place is warping the surrounding air and floors.<br/>
<br/>
With a boom sound, my body fell down about 10 centimeters.<br/>
The ground below us probably sunk.<br/>
<br/>
Without getting distracted by unnecessary things, I devote myself to strike the demon lord with all my power.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
◇<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
"....A draw huh."<br/>
<br/>
Our strength-on-strength competition was never settled as I endured the 180 seconds until the time-out.<br/>
The purple aura covering the demon lord's body has disappeared.<br/>
<br/>
Judging from the terrible sights of the floors and the walls, my companions seem to have prepared various support attacks to stop the demon lord from fleeing.<br/>
<br/>
"But, now's our great turn."<br/>
<br/>
I declared as such to the unmoving demon lord.<br/>
<br/>
--ＺＨＷＵＵＵ.<br/>
<br/>
The demon lord roared lightly.<br/>
<br/>
"Dunno what you're trying to pull, but don't think it'll let you do that easily."<br/>
<br/>
The slashing attack of the holy sword Arondight swings down on the demon lord.<br/>
Without being able to guard with his arms or weapons, the demon lord received the holy sword with his purple costume.<br/>
<br/>
I can feel the sensation of magic defense destruction from the holy sword.<br/>
However, the costume that's not protected by Unique Skill can't possibly defend against the holy sword clad with the effect of [Strongest Lance (Nothing Cannot be Penetrated)].<br/>
<br/>
--ＺＨＷＷＵＵＵＵＮ.<br/>
<br/>
The demon lord's costume split open, purple blood scatter, the demon lord falls down behind.<br/>
<br/>
The blood spilled on the ground cause white smoke.<br/>
The acid blood is dangerous enough to break through mid level defensive magic, but my [Invincible Shield (Nothing can Penetrate)] and Loreiya's advanced defensive magic block it all.<br/>
<br/>
I stop thinking needless things and ready the next technique.<br/>
The blue light draws a perfect circle, matching the holy sword's movement.<br/>
<br/>
"--<<Shining Blade>>"<br/>
<br/>
Blue light assaults the demon lord crawling on the ground.<br/>
<br/>
--ＺＨＷＷＷＵＵＵＵＵＵＵＷＮ.<br/>
<br/>
The demon lord roared while emitting purple right before my finisher hit it.<br/>
<br/>
He might be going to use the directional anti-personnel mine like before.<br/>
I jump back while still maintaining the stance of the technique.<br/>
<br/>
"There's no change in equipment, only his appearance that's changed a bit. Purple light seem to be leaking from his joints somehow."<br/>
<br/>
Don't tell me--.<br/>
<br/>
I appraise him, his state's changed to [Berserker].<br/>
He's way too faithful to the original. I can feel yer love y'know.<br/>
<br/>
--ＺＨＷＷＷＵＵＵＵＵＵＵＷＮ.<br/>
<br/>
Together with the roar, the demon lord jumps up into the air.<br/>
With a woosh, dark purple wings of light appear on the demon lord's back.<br/>
<br/>
"Convenient."<br/>
<br/>
A bit later after Wi's muttering, Mary and the others who have finished their chanting releases the forbidden spell.<br/>
<br/>
""".... ■■■■■■■■■■ <<Divine Plasma Pole>>"""<br/>
<br/>
The blinding pillar of light appears in the center of the hall, swallowing the demon lord.<br/>
<br/>
--ＺＨＷＷＷＵＵＵＵＵＵＵＷＮ.<br/>
<br/>
"We did it!"<br/>
"Yeah, with such a powerful magic, even a demon lord shouldn't get out of it unscathed."<br/>
<br/>
I could hear the black knights' cheers.<br/>
<br/>
--ＺＨＷＷＷＵＵＵＵＵＵＵＷＮ.<br/>
<br/>
And, as if ridiculing them, the demon lord roared to signify his well being.<br/>
<br/>
"I-Impossible! How could one who belongs to evil be unhurt inside the forbidden spell of light magic!"<br/>
"Oh, God Parion, please bestow upon us your protection."<br/>
<br/>
The black knights and Parion priests who have just been added to this party have begun to panic hearing the demon lord's roar.<br/>
<br/>
--ＺＨＷＷＷＵＵＵＵＵＵＵＷＮ.<br/>
<br/>
His hands pierce through the light pillar, and then he shows up behind the hands that bend the light.<br/>
<br/>
--He's truly unhurt.<br/>
<br/>
Even the yellow demon whose level was higher than this demon lord shouldn't be fine after receiving such a forbidden spell.<br/>
Just why--.<br/>
<br/>
"It's like the time when the demon lord was about to transform."<br/>
<br/>
--That's it.<br/>
<br/>
I understand after hearing Rin's muttering.<br/>
That berserker state was a second transformation huh.... I've made a huge mistake.<br/>
<br/>
Purple light is flickering in the demon lord's mouth.<br/>
<br/>
"Loreiya, block it!"<br/>
<br/>
I shot <<Shining Blade>> toward the demon lord's mouth at the same time I gave the order.  I couldn't even afford to shout out the technique's name.<br/>
<br/>
"O Divine Talisman! 『Protection』!"<br/>
<br/>
The Talisman that Loreiya holds high up produces blue light that protects my companions.<br/>
We shouldn't abuse it considering the compensation, but any other method would not make it in time.<br/>
<br/>
The defensive wall created by the Talisman and the dark purple breath are scattering intense sparks and light on the surrounding.<br/>
The shocking thunderous sound is really making my stomach queasy.<br/>
My ears have been buzzing for a while, I can't hear well.<br/>
<br/>
--ＺＨＷＷＷＵＵＵＵＵＵＵＷＮ.<br/>
<br/>
After he had done emitting the breath, the demon lord roared at the ceiling.<br/>
<br/>
Responding to that, oozing shadows beside the demon lord are--.<br/>
<br/>
『Arrived as ordered. Brown Third, obtruding here.』<br/>
『The same, Brown First, obtruding.』<br/>
<br/>
Two greater demons gushed out of the space.<br/>
Both of them are level 60.<br/>
<br/>
Greater demons that we had never encountered so far, appearing at such timing....<br/>
<br/>
"Hmph, greater demons are no match for me no matter how many they are!"<br/>
<br/>
Even while feeling the absurdity, I rouse up my fighting spirit by feeding on that indignation.<br/>
<br/>
However, the bad news continue--.<br/>
<br/>
"Hero-sama, there's a big crowd of monsters behind."<br/>
"Please look above! So many slimes they're touching the ceiling!"<br/>
<br/>
The black knights reported.<br/>
<br/>
"Hayato, leave the greater demons to us."<br/>
"Yea, that's right. Having no moment to show up feels lonely."<br/>
<br/>
Rusus and Fifi glare at the greater demons with their beloved swords in their hands.<br/>
<br/>
"Wi and I will support Rusus and Fifi. Seina, please help the black knights to deal with the small fries and the slimes, Rin and Loreiya, fight the demon lord with Hayato!"<br/>
<br/>
Mary gave orders to our companions without hesitation.<br/>
I feel we're at a bit of disadvantage, but we should be able to manage somehow.<br/>
<br/>
In short, we can turn things around if the great me just defeat the demon lord.<br/>
<br/>
"Hayato! Dodge!"<br/>
<br/>
Crisis Perception skill reacted at the same time as Rin's warning.<br/>
I evaded the black sword right before it touched me, but I still got a shallow wound.<br/>
<br/>
"Fumu, good reaction. Brown Zero, pleased to make you an acquaintance."<br/>
<br/>
A brown greater demon whose upper body appeared from the shadow sinks back into it.<br/>
My counterattack didn't reach it, as the shadow I hit was merely a shadow.<br/>
<br/>
"You shouldn't look away, Hero. Brown Seventh obtruding."<br/>
"Hoohoo, where are you looking at Hero. Brown Sixth obtruding--"<br/>
<br/>
I couldn't even crack jokes while fighting against the despair of the appearing greater demons.<br/>
Compared to the school of the Great Monstrous Fish Tovkezeera the yellow demon summoned back then, there's still a hope to turn this situation around.<br/>
<br/>
--ＺＨＷＷＷＵＵＵＵＵＵＵＷＮ.<br/>
<br/>
The demon lord's roar echoed, its wings increased to six with the third transformation.<br/>
The halo on his back makes him look like a transcendental being here.<br/>
<br/>
--However, that's merely a look.<br/>
<br/>
He's still way off from being transcendent.<br/>
Ya can't be one if you're not at least as senseless as Nanashi.<br/>
<br/>
"GUOAAAAAAAA"<br/>
"T-The monsters spurted out!"<br/>
<br/>
While hearing the black knights' and Seina's screamd behind, my mind has made up to defeat the demon lord even if we both end up dying.<br/>
It's sad that I won't be able to meet my little sister and my childhood friend in the former world anymore, but My Honey who's in the same labyrinth will be in danger if I don't defeat him here.<br/>
<br/>
"《SING》 Arondight, 《PLAY》 Tunas"<br/>
<br/>
I recited the Scriptures of the Holy Sword and the Holy Armor that had lost its effect once again, activated my trump card, the [Limitless Recovery], and drank the [Acceleration] magic potion last resort.<br/>
<br/>
--Let's do this, demon lord.<br/>
<br/>
I'll put some intense get-well gifts in your face.<br/>
<br/>
Hero's life ain't that cheap y'know!<br/>
