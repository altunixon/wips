Chapter 1: The Nostalgic Post Station Town<br/>
<br/>
1<br/>
The tenth day of the White Month was the day after I was freed from the Count Turan manor, thanks to the efforts of Ai Fa.8<br/>
After spending a night in the Wu clan village, Ai Fa and I got permission from the tribal chief Donda Wu to head to the Post Station Town. We were accompanied by five escorts, including Ludo Wu and Shin Wu.<br/>
I wasn’t allowed to reopen my stalls yet, so this was just a visit to the Post Station Town to prepare for my stalls’ reopening and to greet the relevant people involved.<br/>
Since my business at the stalls and the inns was managed by Leina Wu and the others, it wouldn’t be difficult for me to restart again. But Donda Wu thought we should proceed with caution before the meeting between the tribal chiefs and Pyschkurewuss at noon.<br/>
Pyschkurewuss was made a fool yesterday, but there was no telling what might have changed after one night. Was Pyschkurewuss really not involved in this? Did he really punish Lifuria? The date of the meeting to discuss the fate of the Tsun clan was getting close, and the relationship between Pyschkurewuss and the denizens of Forest’s Edge was getting tenser by the moment.<br/>
"By the way, Graff Zaza must be hopping mad about the mess I got into, right?"<br/>
I asked on the journey there, and Ai Fa nodded after sweeping the area with serious eyes:<br/>
"He gave Donda Wu and me an earful, saying this was all because of the business in the Post Station Town. However, what infuriated Graff Zaza the most was Asuta being kidnapped by villains."<br/>
"Huh? So he was worried about me… That can’t be."<br/>
"Well, even though you’re a foreigner, if we recognize you as one of us, then you are a tribemate of Forest’s Edge denizens. We will spare no quarters to enemies of the Forest’s Edge… An eye for an eye, a tooth for a tooth."<br/>
"… I see…"<br/>
"Donda Wu was very agitated and certain that the culprit was Pyschkurewuss. If Kaslan Lutim and Dali Sauti didn’t stop him by saying we shouldn’t act without getting the evidence, the hunters of Forest’s Edge would probably have laid siege to the city gates."<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
There were 500-odd Forest’s Edge denizens. Assuming half were men, and excluding children younger than 13… There should be around 200 hunters.<br/>
I didn’t know how large an army Genos had, but that many hunters would definitely make them nervous. It might have even evolved into a war with the survival of Genos or the Forest’s Edge on the line. Just thinking about that gave me chills.<br/>
"It’s true; I was ready for war, man. And the cause of the conflict would be our failure to protect Asuta."<br/>
Ai Fa had a sharp gleam in her eyes as Ludo Wu continued:<br/>
"The Wu clan sent out four hunters, but we failed to stop two criminals. I’m so ashamed of my own incompetence that I feel like scalping myself."<br/>
"I’m very sorry, it’s all because I wasn’t careful."<br/>
"No, protecting Asuta is our job. Really now… Dad lectured me, and Ai Fa cried…"<br/>
"… Ludo Wu."<br/>
Ai Fa’s voice that sounded like the rumbling of the earth cut Ludo Wu short.<br/>
"Ah, no no no. It wasn’t like the wailing of children, you know? It’s like, the scary eyes of my father and sobbing quietly…"<br/>
"Ludo Wu!"<br/>
"Alright, alright. Anyway, we won’t make the same mistake again. This time, we will definitely do our jobs properly."<br/>
I felt really apologetic upon hearing what Ludo Wu said. No one from Forest’s Edge scolded me since last night.<br/>
They probably felt it was expected that a weak chef like me couldn’t fend for myself. In contrast, Ludo Wu and the others bore most of the blame and got lectured by others. This situation pained me.<br/>
"Oh, we are finally here."<br/>
I lifted my head when I heard Ludo Wu’s voice, and I could see buildings in the distance.<br/>
I loaned the wagon to Leina Wu, so we walked here as there were too many of us for Gilulu.<br/>
It was almost noon. Pyschkurewuss’ meeting with Donda Wu’s group should be starting soon. After spending the night at the Wu clan village, I returned to the Fa house in the morning to take care of the minimal essential chores. It was already so late when we came back here.<br/>
"… Sorry, Ai Fa, for disrupting your hunting work for so many days."<br/>
I apologized to her softly, but Ai Fa said moodily: "Enough about that."<br/>
"I acted according to my own judgment, so don’t be bothered by that."<br/>
"That’s right; there are only two persons in your family, so hunting one kiba every five days is enough to complete your hunting obligations. Ai Fa hunted plenty of kiba recently, so no one will say anything even if you takes a few days off."<br/>
After hearing what Ludo Wu said, Ai Fa nodded with a sour face and grunted. It probably hurt Ai Fa’s pride when she requested to be the escort on every other day, prioritizing this over her hunting duties.<br/>
By the way, Ai Fa scored a kiba every two days for this half month, not one in every five days. Including the money I earned, the Fa house’s wealth had been increasing steadily in this period.<br/>
"So we finally reached the Post Station Town, huh. After the previous incident, there shouldn’t be any more careless fools here. So keep your guard up, everyone."<br/>
The branch house hunters around me nodded with a sharp gaze in their eyes.<br/>
I felt really tense too. I would be seeing for myself whether that incident had caused an irreconcilable gulf between the denizens of Forest’s Edge and the people of Post Station Town.<br/>
Leina Wu had been running her business without any incident, and her sales were pretty good too. I didn’t need to be too worried, but I couldn’t be too optimistic either.<br/>
"Let’s go."<br/>
On Ludo Wu’s word, the escorts headed towards the buildings and stepped onto the stone-paved road. The sun was already high up, and the streets were filled with people.<br/>
After walking for a while, a southerner who was walking hastily down the street looked back at us in surprise:<br/>
"Hey, aren’t you the guy selling kiba meat!?"<br/>
He looked really familiar, probably a patron I met at the stall several times. Southerners all had similar builds and brown beards, so it was hard to differentiate them.<br/>
"You’re really back! I heard the rumors! You were abducted by a daughter of a noble and confined in the city, right?"<br/>
"Huh? News have already spread in the Post Station Town?"<br/>
I was taken aback, but Ai Fa just glared at me.<br/>
"Didn’t I tell you last night that we told everyone related to you? We just asked them not to say anything before dusk, but to spread everywhere after that. That way, even if they apprehended me after I went into the city, we could follow up with our next step. That’s what Kaslan Lutim planned."<br/>
After that, it became common knowledge in the Post Station Town that Pyschkurewuss’s daughter Lifuria ordered her minions Moose and Sangjura to abduct me.<br/>
"If Geta was lying, we would be slandering Pyschkurewuss without any evidence, but we were desperate. After all… It had been five days since you were taken away."<br/>
Seeing that we were talking to ourselves, the southerner put the goods over his shoulder again and went on his way.<br/>
"Nevermind, it’s good that you are safe. I’m looking forward to your reopening."<br/>
"Ah, alright. Thank you very much!"<br/>
He then disappeared in the crowd.<br/>
As we moved along, several people called out to me too.<br/>
Including Ai Fa, there were six hunters walking with me, but the pedestrians weren’t bothered by them. Having sixty Forest’s Edge denizens running around the Post Station Town for the whole 5 days allowed the townsfolk to gain immunity towards the hunters.<br/>
The easterners greeted me quietly with their hoods on as usual, while a few energetic southerners told Ludo Wu and Shin Wu: "It’s great that your friend has been rescued", which surprised me.<br/>
But in contrast, there was a group that was even warier of us. This was very prominent among the westerners.<br/>
So the denizens of the Forest’s Edge are like that… And this happened while we were under close scrutiny.<br/>
Maybe they thought the denizens of the Forest’s Edge were willing to put their lives on the line for their tribemates. On the other hand, they might have felt the Forest’s Edge denizens were terrorists that would go all out to take vengeance against their enemy.<br/>
There wasn’t anything wrong with either view. Since the Forest’s Edge denizens were on bad terms with powerful nobles like Pyschkurewuss, some might think the denizens were dangerous.<br/>
It wasn’t clear right now whether this incident had a positive or negative impact.<br/>
From this atmosphere, it seems people who are friendly have gotten nicer, while those who dislike us became even more hostile.<br/>
I thought while heading north to check on the stalls and found Uncle Dora’s stall opened at the usual place.<br/>
"Oh, Asuta, you came to visit."<br/>
Uncle Dora said with a smile.<br/>
Tara was smiling beside him too.<br/>
"Thank you for coming yesterday despite the late hour. Sorry for making you worry…"<br/>
"It’s all good! You are back safe and sound after all."<br/>
Uncle Dora smiled cheerfully, his emotive eyes were already tearing up.<br/>
"Are you going to your stalls? It sure is crowded over there; those girls are as capable as Asuta."<br/>
"Yes, I think so too."<br/>
"Tch, you sure are taking things easy! If you don’t buck up, you will lose your place, Asuta!" Uncle Dora grinned and showed his white teeth.<br/>
I thanked him again and headed north.<br/>
It was the peak period, and the stalls were surrounded by a mob.<br/>
"Ah, Asuta!"<br/>
Leina Wu who was making "Kiba burgers" smiled brilliantly at me.<br/>
I smiled back at her and noticed an unexpected figure beside her. A large head and small body… She was formerly the youngest daughter of the Tsun clan, Zwei Tsun.<br/>
"Ah, Asuta of the Fa house, you are really back. We will be fine even if you don’t come."<br/>
"Z-Zwei. Long time no see; you came to help out at the stall today too?"<br/>
Zwei and her mother Aura were now members of the Lutim house. It wasn’t surprising to see her helping out at the stall… However, she was one of the people Pyschkurewuss was demanding for. Pyschkurewuss might not know her, but this was still a bold choice.<br/>
"Hmmp! Because no one could count money as well as me, so it couldn’t be helped! Asuta, don’t you dare sprout any weird excuses to exclude me!"<br/>
She looked at me with her sanpaku eyes.<br/>
"And, what do you mean by ‘came to help out’? This work is a contract between the Wu house and the people in town! Don’t assume we will give you back this business!"<br/>
"Hey, Zwei. Do your work before nagging at others; you are troubling us, you know? You are better at talking than doing."<br/>
Leina Wu admonished her with a smile.<br/>
"Annoying!"<br/>
Zwei got mad.<br/>
By the way, Zwei was very short, so she did her work while sitting on a high stool.<br/>
"Ah, Asuta, you are late! Shela Wu, Asuta’s here!"<br/>
"Oh, Asuta… I just saw you yesterday, but I’m glad to see that you are lively."<br/>
Lala Wu and Shela Wu were working at an adjacent stall.<br/>
The only thing on the menu was "Kiba burgers", so I thought they only rented one stall. It seemed like I was wrong.<br/>
Leina Wu explained to me with a smile: "That’s correct. It takes some time to make additional portions after the "Kiba burgers" sell out, right? So when there are only a few left, I shift all of them to the pot in one stall and make new ones at the other stall. So we can cook a new batch while selling the ones we still have."<br/>
She had been smiling all this time.<br/>
"It is much more efficient this way, and we have been preparing a hundred "Kiba burgers" every day."<br/>
"We can sell them out a little after noon. It would be troublesome to prepare more portions, and we also needed to search for Asuta, so I think this is an adequate number."<br/>
"I see. Thank you, everyone. I didn’t expect you, girls, to keep the business going even without me."<br/>
"Shela Wu and I feel that this is the right path to take. It must be the guidance of the forest, since we could already prepare the ingredients by ourselves."<br/>
Leina Wu smiled proudly.<br/>
Indeed, this was something only Leina Wu’s group could do. They had also displayed their capabilities to the people in the Post Station Town.<br/>
"So, Asuta will be starting work tomorrow, right? There are many southerners who are craving for the myam dish."<br/>
"That will depend on the result of the meeting today. If Pyschkurewuss takes back what he said yesterday, it will cause another commotion."<br/>
As I was answering her, a group of Forest’s Edge denizens appeared from the south.<br/>
They were Rii Sudora’s group who had came for the afternoon shift. As Leina Wu took on the work at the inn on top of the stalls, she needed Rii Sudora to help out for the afternoon shift.<br/>
Rii Sudora had six hunters with her, more than that time when Zattsu Tsun caused an uproar in the Post Station Town.<br/>
"So Asuta is here too; I’m glad that you are safe."<br/>
The wife of the Sudora house head Rii Sudora had a refreshing smile.<br/>
I already greeted her when we dropped by the Fa house in the morning. News of my safe return had already been relayed to many houses, but our neighbors such as the Sudora house were still praying for my safety.<br/>
"Alright then; Rii Sudora, please tend to the stall while we are away. Asuta, are you going to the inns later…? If it is not too much trouble, please come with us."<br/>
Leina Wu said to me with a smile. Leina Wu and Lala Wu would be the ones catering for the inns.<br/>
And then, the men who had handed over their escort duties to the guards that came with Rii Sudora walked out of the woods. There were six of them.<br/>
I had six escorts, the stall had six guards, and the six men accompanied Leina Wu to the inns… There were a total of 18 Forest’s Edge hunters involved here.<br/>
In the past, to avoid agitating the people in the Post Station Town, the escort duties were handled by the young hunters from the Wu clan and Lutim house. However, they didn’t have so many youths in their family. The young hunters acted as my escorts, while the other twelve were a group of mixed ages from the Lutim and Lei houses.<br/>
Ludo Wu said: "There were more hunters in the Post Station Town yesterday. There’s no point trying to keep up appearances now. And… Since there are people who will attack us head-on, we can’t keep holding back."<br/>
And so, our grand group of 15 headed to the 《Cryptic Venerable Inn》… Though, there was a small incident along the way. A band of town guards rushed in from the other end of the street and blocked our path.<br/>
"W-What are you all doing? You found your lost tribemate, so you don’t need to have so many Forest’s Edge denizens running around the Post Station Town, right?"<br/>
Standing at the front was the short guard captain who talked to us in front of Uncle Dora’s stall some time ago. He only had five men with him and looked a little pale.<br/>
"Oh, it’s you. We have been in your care these few days. In the end, the culprit really was a noble, huh. Your efforts weren’t in vain, thank you for everything you did for Asuta."<br/>
Ludo Wu who was from the Wu clan main house answered on our behalf.<br/>
"I-I’m not here to talk about that! Why are you wandering around town with that many people? It’s a crime to incite panic to the townsfolk!"<br/>
"Hmm? We are just escorting our frail chefs. Two groups happened to be walking together, that’s why there are so many people. We only have six guards for each group, because four isn’t enough; after all, what can we do just four guards…?"<br/>
"B-But…"<br/>
"Why don’t we split into groups of 7 to 8 here? You are fine with that, right?"<br/>
The guard captain shut up helplessly, and a young guard I had seen somewhere before stepped forth.<br/>
"Forest’s Edge denizens, we did rebuke your suspicion that the culprit is a noble from the city and bar you from the city gate. However… We definitely have no intentions of covering up for the criminal."<br/>
"Yes, I know. Didn’t I thank you for your efforts? You don’t have the authority to enter the city either, so we can’t really fault you either."<br/>
Ludo Wu probably wasn’t being sarcastic, but the young guard still bit his lips vexingly. Before I was abducted, he even preached about how the nobles in the city were magnanimous and just.<br/>
And the culprit this time was the Lifuria, the niece of their big boss, commander of the town guards, Shileru. After claiming so much about how fair and just Shileru and the nobles were, their credibility was all shot.<br/>
"In any case, we don’t want the people to panic. If our group upsets the townsfolk, we will split into two groups. So please, leave us be."<br/>
The talk then ended.<br/>
Leina Wu’s group went on ahead, and we set off again when they had gone ten or so meters.<br/>
"… They might be the town guards, but did the negative influence of Pyschkurewuss affect the soldiers on the ground?" I whispered quietly after the guards had moved some distance away.<br/>
Ludo Wu shrugged and said: "That’s hard to say. If we didn’t figure out the culprit this time, they would have just carried out their work normally. How’s that different from acting on the whims of the nobles?"<br/>
"Is that so? That young guard didn’t seem to like following unreasonable orders though."<br/>
Ai Fa interjected quietly: "However, if the commander giving the orders is complicit, those working under him will be led astray too. Have you forgotten? When we had a run-in with the second son of the Tsun clan, the guards only listened to the Tsun clan. If someone gives such standing orders, they have no choice but to follow them."<br/>
What she said was true.<br/>
Also, that young guard seemed to trust Shileru, but we were suspicious of him, wondering if he was an accomplice of Pyschkurewuss.<br/>
I held back a sigh and another question occurred to me.<br/>
"By the way, aren’t the number of guards on patrol much lesser than usual? Before I was kidnapped, there were a lot of guards patrolling because of reports of banditry."<br/>
"Yes, I heard a few days ago that a special task force was formed to subjugate those bandits, so they couldn’t spare too many people to search for Asuta. I haven’t told you yet… But after you got abducted to the city, the bandits disguised as denizens of Forest’s Edge assaulted a random farm every other day."<br/>
"Did they finally send a bandit subjugation force outside of Genos?"<br/>
"I don’t know the details, but that is probably it."<br/>
Ai Fa answered with a serious face.<br/>
In order to search for the elusive wife of Goram, the head of the ‘Red Beard Gang’, Kamyua Yost left Genos with hunters from the Wu clan branch house and had yet to return.<br/>
Was Pyschkurewuss trying to pin the crimes of banditry on these hunters? That was just a plausible explanation, but I couldn’t help feeling the situation was getting really tense.<br/>
"Anyway, there’s no point in worrying about people who aren’t in town. Kamyua has three Wu clan hunters with him, so they can overcome any dangers they might face."<br/>
While chatting, we reached the 《Cryptic Venerable Inn》.<br/>
We met up with Leina Wu who was waiting at the entrance and headed in together. Ai Fa, Shin Wu, and another two hunters acted as our escorts, with the rest guarding the outside.<br/>
"Oh, Asuta… and the members of the Wu clan, welcome."<br/>
Neil who was at the reception counter stood up.<br/>
He was emotionless as usual, but his eyes were filled with emotions.<br/>
"I’m very glad to welcome Asuta again after all that has happened."<br/>
"What are you saying, I’m the one who caused you trouble."<br/>
"No, it’s my fault for not noticing that the people lodging in my inn are villains. If I had paid more attention, all this could have been prevented."<br/>
"No, but…"<br/>
"Asuta, can I continue working with you?"<br/>
Neil had deadly resolve in his eyes.<br/>
"Don’t say that… I’m actually here to ask if you hate me now."<br/>
"Oh, you are too kind. I have no reason to detest Asuta."<br/>
Really?<br/>
His life was in danger, so I didn’t see any reason why he would be adamant on being friends with me, but…<br/>
"In the first place, there are many easterners lodging with me and who are friendly towards Asuta and the denizens of Forest’s Edge. Even after the violent acts by the nobles, they didn’t avoid my inn. Hence, I don’t wish to lose my relationship with the Forest’s Edge."<br/>
Neil put his fingers together before his chest as he continued:<br/>
"Also, Leina Wu’s cooking is well-received here, and demand for Asuta’s cooking is also very high. So I hope you can continue to support this inn in the future."<br/>
"Will this really be fine? The culprit might be Pyschkurewuss’ daughter, but relations between the denizens of Forest’s Edge and Pyschkurewuss have always been complicated."<br/>
"It’s alright. Or rather, since this incident has been made public, the nobles won’t be able to do something like this again, correct?"<br/>
Neil had no reservation in his eyes.<br/>
I lowered my head and said: "Thank you."<br/>
"However, the tribal chiefs of Forest’s Edge will be meeting with Pyschkurewuss today, so please wait until the meeting ends. I will then discuss in the future with my friends and the tribal chiefs."<br/>
"I understand. I look forward to hearing good news from you."<br/>
I thanked him again and was about to leave 《Cryptic Venerable Inn》.<br/>
But I remembered something that bothered me and decided to clarify it.<br/>
"By the way, Leina Wu also uses Tau sauce here? Tau sauce is a specialty from Jaguar, wouldn’t the easterners dislike it?"<br/>
"My easterner guests are broad-minded and won’t be bothered by such things. I don’t think Jaguar people refrain from eating Semu food either."<br/>
"I see, that’s great."<br/>
"Also, Chitto suits Leina Wu’s cooking too. Adding too much will destroy the taste, but sprinkling a dash of chopped Chitto makes the easterners really happy."<br/>
"Ah, I see."<br/>
For "Tau sauce kiba soup" that tasted similar to kenchin soup, the chili-like Chitto would complement it greatly.[1]<br/>
"Also, if I resume my business, how about Leina Wu and me alternate the catering every other day?"<br/>
I turned towards the subject herself after saying that.<br/>
"Ah, I’m sorry, I should consult Leina Wu first. Leina Wu, will catering for the inns be too heavy a burden for the Wu clan?"<br/>
"Not really. If I can find enough helpers to tend the stalls, it won’t be a problem… But, since Asuta is back, there’s no need to cater for them, right?"<br/>
Leina Wu opened her eyes wide.<br/>
Lala Wu frowned quizzingly.<br/>
"That’s not true. There is a great significance of native Forest’s Edge denizens like Leina Wu building relationships with the townsfolk of the Post Station Town, instead of a foreigner like me. This would also be a good chance for Leina Wu to show your culinary skills."<br/>
"You are right. Asuta, I understand."<br/>
Neil who was passionate about cultural interactions expressed his approval. Leina Wu lowered her head and thought over my words, and then said:<br/>
"Alright. I will discuss this with Papa Donda. Erm… Asuta…"<br/>
Leina Wu looked a little lost and held my hands tightly.<br/>
"Thank you very much. I’m not sure if I really understand how you think and feel… But I’m very proud of myself."<br/>
She probably didn’t misunderstand my intentions.<br/>
Leina Wu had a refreshing smile that made me feel that way.<br/>
I didn’t know what to do about Leina Wu in the past, but our relationship had grown stronger through cooking, and I could talk to her without any reservation.<br/>
And now, we could encourage each other in our lives. With those feelings in mind, I left the 《Cryptic Venerable Inn》.<br/>
"I think Leina Wu… changed a lot in the past few days."<br/>
As we headed to the next destination, the 《Big Tree of the South Inn》, Ai Fa muttered softly.<br/>
"She has a strong lifeforce about her, like a blooming Mizora flower. And this strength… resembles the strength I feel from Asuta."<br/>
"Yes, both Leina Wu and I are chefs, so we have similar strengths."<br/>
I was in awe due to astuteness of her observations as I answered. But Ai Fa pouted unhappily.<br/>
"The idea that there is someone else like you out there irks me. And… Leina Wu is not as retarded as you."<br/>
"Retardedness aside… Ai Fa, you also possess prowess that rivals other hunters, and have been working hard all this time, right? Leina Wu must think the same way as me."<br/>
"… Leina Wu wants to defeat you though?"<br/>
There was a sharp gleam in Ai Fa’s eyes.<br/>
I shrugged with a wry smile.<br/>
"That’s not a bad thing. Ai Fa, aren’t you aiming to be a powerful hunter like Dan Lutim and Donda Wu too? That’s definitely not a bad thing."<br/>
"…"<br/>
"And because people like her exist, I feel the pressure of being surpassed and want to work hard. Dan Lutim and the others also respect Ai Fa’s prowess and train hard so they won’t lose to you."<br/>
"… I see."<br/>
Ai Fa mumbled softly.<br/>
"Actually, I understand that this isn’t a bad thing for Asuta and Leina Wu."<br/>
"That’s great."<br/>
"However, I won’t permit you losing to Leina Wu as a chef, you got that?"<br/>
"How should I put this… If Leina Wu and Shela Wu continue to accumulate experience and knowledge, I honestly don’t know how far they can go."<br/>
"Don’t say something so disheartening. No means no."<br/>
Ai Fa then pouted her lips that returned to normal just now.<br/>
Escorted by the intimidating hunters, today felt much more peaceful and blissful than yesterday. As I walked along the bustling street, I felt this once again.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
2<br/>
After that, the talks at the 《Big Tree of the South Inn》 also ended smoothly.<br/>
Naudiz was more business-minded than Neil, so I thought he might want to end his ties with us. Fortunately, he was more enthusiastic about working with me again than I expected.<br/>
"My wife did tell me that working with the denizens of Forest’s Edge is very dangerous. Even more so since the one at odds with you is Count Turan, a big shot in the city."<br/>
Naudiz then continued:<br/>
"However! My inn is famous for being the first to cater Asuta’s dishes. If we stop now, the 《Cryptic Venerable Inn》 might surpass my inn!"<br/>
Naudiz, who was a mixed blood between the south and west, had a stronger sense of rivalry against the 《Cryptic Venerable Inn》 than I imagined.<br/>
Hostility between the southerners and easterners was not permitted here, but competing as businessmen was the right path to take.<br/>
"Also, Asuta is getting more and more famous in the Post Station Town. Not working together with Asuta in such a situation goes against my business sense."<br/>
"Huh? I’m getting famous?"<br/>
"Of course; you were scouted by the daughter of Count Turan, who is known for being a gourmet, and your fame has spread. I only learned of this last night, but it had caused quite an uproar at my inn, you know?"<br/>
"Yes, but the 《Big Tree of the South Inn》 is also selling food made by Leina Wu, right? Those who have tasted it should know she is as good as me. The food sold at the stall is also cooked by her."<br/>
"Yes, but those visiting Genos in the past few days have never tasted Asuta’s cooking before. So the better Leina Wu’s dishes are, the more anticipation they have for Asuta’s cuisine."<br/>
The difficulty level was skyrocketing. Since Leina Wu’s "Tau sauce kiba soup" tasted better than mine, it would be an arduous task.<br/>
"It’s true that her skills are on par with Asuta, but to me, the "Braised kiba" is the most delicious dish. And, of course, "Meat Chachi" is great too. Truth be told, I don’t want to give up on these dishes."<br/>
In any case, Naudiz also asked me to continue our partnership, so it was good news.<br/>
I gave Naudiz the same conditions as Neil and then headed for the last place I would be visiting, the 《Kimyusu’s Tail Inn》, with a load off my mind… However, there was a minor incident waiting for me there.<br/>
"Hey, what’s happening?"<br/>
The one who noticed first was Ludo Wu who was walking ahead of us.<br/>
I looked at the situation over his shoulder and held my breath.<br/>
That was the inn I was most familiar with, the 《Kimyusu’s Tail Inn》. Beside that large building with a red roof was a big box carriage.<br/>
"A Totos carriage, huh. There wasn’t one when we passed by earlier, right?"<br/>
Ludo Wu narrowed his eyes warily.<br/>
However, Ai Fa and I knew this carriage.<br/>
The large carriage towed by a single Totos, with a familiar banner hanging on its side. The emblem on the banner was exactly the same as the one on the carriage Ai Fa and I rode on to leave the city last night.<br/>
A large figure appeared from the shade of the carriage.<br/>
"Oh, you are finally here."<br/>
Ludo Wu who had his hands ready on his waist said: "So it’s just you."<br/>
"I was ready to beat you up. What’s with your dressing?"<br/>
"I had a lot of things on my plate too, and I prefer not to die."<br/>
With a Semu-like cloak and hood and a grey cloth around his mouth, it was the Guardian Zashuma.<br/>
"It would be bad if anyone learns that I introduced the denizens of Forest’s Edge to the Count Taliem house. That fellow over there doesn’t really want to conceal his identity, so I had to conceal mine. Ah, don’t mention my name to anyone."<br/>
He said with the corners of his eyes under the hood raised in a smile.<br/>
I thanked him for what happened yesterday before asking for the details.<br/>
"Sir Polarse is going off soon. I heard you will be visiting the stalls and the inn, so I was waiting for you here."<br/>
"Why don’t we talk elsewhere? I don’t want to drag the innkeeper into this."<br/>
"It won’t matter; we will be involving the entire Post Station Town soon, so there’s no danger. Anyway… Before the ‘Northern Whirlwind’ returns, I don’t really want to trouble ‘that’ person."<br/>
What dangerous words.<br/>
And Zashuma’s eyes were still smiling.<br/>
"However, the ‘Northern Whirlwind’ planned to bring in that person right from the start. It is difficult to oppose Pyschkurewuss with just Malfreed-sama alone. So in a sense, we are just starting our plan a few days earlier. By the way… According to our plan, the ‘Northern Whirlwind’ should have returned to Genos by now."<br/>
"I’m confused. Can you tell me the details?"<br/>
"You should ask Polarse-sama directly. I want to avoid any more trouble."<br/>
With no other choice, we entered the 《Kimyusu’s Tail Inn》.<br/>
Waiting for us inside was the sour-faced Milano Mast.<br/>
"Ah, Milano Mast, that’s…"<br/>
"You are finally here. The noble has been waiting for you in the dining hall for a while now. Ah… You don’t need to tell me anything. That noble booked the dining hall until the second koku with three white copper plates."<br/>
Milano Mast was impatient as usual.<br/>
"I don’t really like aristocrats, but this is business. He only booked the dining hall, so hurry on over."<br/>
"Alright, I’m very sorry."<br/>
Polarse was my benefactor and different from my impression of a noble in a good way. There were many suspicious things about him, but such a forceful way of doing things frightened me a little.<br/>
Ai Fa and Shin Wu followed me in, while my other four escorts stayed outside.<br/>
The dining hall of the 《Kimyusu’s Tail Inn》 was divided into two sections by a wall. A guard stood at the area that divided the inner and outer sections and, after taking a few steps forward, I saw that familiar figure waiting for me in the deepest end.<br/>
"Oh, you look well, Asuta and Ai Fa. I have been waiting for you."<br/>
Polarse who was seated at the table for six was waving his short and pudgy arms. His brown hair, bright brown eyes, and fat body covered in his cream-colored shirt looked exactly the same as yesterday.<br/>
Behind him were two guards, dressed more elegantly than the towns guards. They were probably guards from the Count Taliem house.<br/>
"Here, make yourself at home. Want to order some fruit wine?"<br/>
"Please don’t mind us. Erm… Is there anything urgent?"<br/>
I sat opposite Polarse, while Ai Fa and Shin Wu stood on my either sides. The masked Zashuma looked on from the side, like a referee of sorts.<br/>
"I guess you can say it’s urgent! I wasn’t that anxious at the start, but my father who returned in the morning lectured me. He asked me why I defied Count Turan, was I trying to destroy the Count Taliem house!? These sort of things. Why should I, who upholds the laws of Genos, be lectured? That’s so unreasonable."<br/>
The chair and table creaked with every word he spoke.<br/>
"I don’t hate the stores in the Post Station Town, but aren’t the seats too confined here? My stomach is already pressing against the table."<br/>
"Fufu. Well… I’m surprised that someone of your standing is visiting the Post Station Town so casually."<br/>
"Hmm? That’s because the Count Taliem house isn’t that rigid. With how things are, having a peerage isn’t that great either. Even now, the landlords of other cities still don’t acknowledge us."<br/>
Polarse said with a smile:<br/>
"The Genos house used to be a Count, and we were just knights serving as his vassals. But after a century, the Genos house was bestowed the title of Marquis, while the Turan, Taliem and Satolas houses were given the peerage of Count, but that is only nominal. When the capital sends an invitation to attend festivals, only Marquis Genos is invited. We are just rich farmers in the boondocks who call ourselves Counts."<br/>
"Is that so…"<br/>
"Furthermore, the only houses with wealth that invites envy are the Marquis Genos house and the Count Turan house…"<br/>
Polarse said as he scratched his nose with his plump finger.<br/>
That man is unscrupulous in his pursuit of profits… Zashuma’s impression of Polarse that I heard from Ai Fa yesterday flashed across my mind.<br/>
"So I decided to participate in Zashuma’s plans… which is also Kamyua’s plan. It’s still acceptable for the Marquis Genos house, the landlord, to enjoy some special privileges, but we can’t let the Count Turan house monopolize the market. Genos can only call itself a prosperous city to the other nations when all the citizens are prosperous. Don’t you think so, Asuta?"<br/>
"It’s as you say… I share the same sentiments…"<br/>
I didn’t even need to steer the conversation before it turned towards the heart of the topic. Polarse arched his back and leaned towards me:<br/>
"Then, allow me to ask this. Asuta, what’s the secret behind the poitan?<br/>
"Huh? What’s wrong with it?"<br/>
"Shush! Not so loud. If Pyschkurewuss caught wind of this before we even act, we would be left in ruins. We have to be extremely careful to start a revolution."<br/>
"Revolution… What an unsettling topic."<br/>
"It’s fine, the only one in danger is Lord Pyschkurewuss."<br/>
Polarse smiled calmly:<br/>
"I bought a meal from your stall earlier. The fuwano-like wrap used in your food is actually poitan… Am I wrong?"<br/>
"No, you are correct. I didn’t really hide that fact from anyone."<br/>
"I’m surprised that didn’t cause a riot! The servant who tasted it commented that it was as good as fuwano. Poitan is much cheaper when compared to fuwano too. If fuwano can be substituted by poitan, what kind of wealth will it generate!? Why doesn’t anyone realize that fact?"<br/>
"W-Wait. If poitan that is cheaper than fuwano became the staple food, wouldn’t the wealth created decrease?"<br/>
"It won’t. The wealth of the Turan house that grows fuwano will decrease, while for the farmers that grow poitan it will increase. Isn’t that so?"<br/>
His words spurred my memory.<br/>
I was warned to hide this technique, even though I didn’t really keep it a secret. The one who warned me was Kamyua Yost.<br/>
Back when I was discussing jerky with him in the 《Kimyusu’s Tail Inn》— a few days before Lala Wu’s birthday. The people in the city grew fuwano, while the people in town cultivated poitan. Hence, if the technique of processing poitan was to spread, the nobles would suffer great losses, earning their grudge.<br/>
Back then, he was vague about who he meant by noble. After the tribal chiefs of the Forest’s Edge held their second conference with Pyschkurewuss, we learned who that ‘noble’ was.<br/>
The Turan territory to the north produced mamaria, that was used to brew fruit wine, and the wheat-like fuwano. Hence, if the business partnership with Banam, which also produced fuwano and mamaria, became better, it would be disadvantageous for Pyschkurewuss. That was why he used Zattsu Tsun to disrupt the trade between Genos and Banam.<br/>
Which meant the ‘noble’ who would suffer losses if poitan becomes popular was Pyschkurewuss.<br/>
At least, I should keep in mind that making poitan delicious can be used as a weapon against the nobles.<br/>
Kamyua Yost once said:<br/>
In order to survive, sometimes, we need to use blades. But if you time it wrong, you might hurt your comrades. So exercise extreme caution.<br/>
I thought about Kamyua Yost’s silly smile and words, then sighed heavily. It had been a long time since I had seen him, but I still couldn’t leave Kamyua Yost’s shadow.<br/>
"I finally understand. The new cooking method for poitan is a powerful weapon that can defy Pyschkurewuss, correct?"<br/>
"That’s right. Did Kamyua tell you that too?"<br/>
"Yes, but he did so in a roundabout way. However… If we strike back at Pyschkurewuss in such a way, the only ones to benefit are the farmers and townsfolk, correct? Is it fine for you to not gain anything from this?"<br/>
"Ah, didn’t anyone tell you? Our Count Taliem house was given the southern farmlands. The farmers working there are the citizens under my charge."<br/>
I finally understood. That was why this man was the ‘last resort’ against Pyschkurewuss.<br/>
"You didn’t think of that, right? If we can overturn the relationship between fuwano and poitan, we can also flip the power relationship between the Count Turan house and Count Taliem house! Just talking about it gives me the shivers."<br/>
Polarse concluded with a smile.<br/>
"P-Please wait. This might be an effective plan, but won’t the other nobles oppose it? If we upset the market prices, won’t that antagonize the Marquis Genos?"<br/>
"Hmm? Didn’t I say that Marquis Genos won’t have anything to lose? If the Count Turan house starts to decline, it might affect the city a little at the start. But if the Count Taliem house maintains the economy, the end result would be the same."<br/>
Polarse probably realized something from my face and changed his posture.<br/>
"Asuta, you are probably still unfamiliar with Genos. Actually, the management of this city is a little special. Genos is a rather large city, but it is divided into quarters and ruled by four houses, which is unique in this world."<br/>
"I see…"<br/>
"The capital probably felt that a single house ruling the relatively large and prosperous Genos city is dangerous. Like I mentioned earlier, a century ago, the three houses were given peerage titles to rule Genos alongside the Marquis Genos house. Marquis Genos is the landlord, but the orchard to the north belongs to the Turan house, the farms to the south are ruled by the Taliem house and the Post Station Town is under the purview of the Satolas house. That was the edict from the capital. As long as we don’t affect the prosperity of the city, Marquis Genos won’t have any problem with us."<br/>
I didn’t expect to learn the internal management system of Genos here.<br/>
I glanced to the side and saw Ai Fa and Shin Wu listening to Polarse with poker faces.<br/>
"A few decades ago, the wealth disparity between the three Count houses wasn’t so obvious. The Turan house focused on the cultivation of fuwano and mamaria on their small and fertile land. The Taliem house grew a diverse variety of crops on their vast but less fertile farmlands. The city and town became prosperous from the agricultural trade too. However… When Lord Pyschkurewuss became the house head, the Turan became incredibly wealthy."<br/>
"Did he use some sort of unethical means?"<br/>
"Unethical, huh… Lord Pyschkurewuss bought a large number of slaves from the north and used them to tend to his fields. Right now, most of the people working in the Turan house orchard are slaves. Because of that… many citizens lost their jobs and had to migrate to the Post Station Town and Taliem house farmlands. Thanks to them, our tax revenue increased, but compared to that, the Count Turan house gained much more wealth."<br/>
So that’s the reason for the slaves.<br/>
This topic was heading into dangerous territory.<br/>
"I think you know the rest better than I do. He sent people to attack his Banam envoy, his competitors, and pushed for his brother Shileru to take the post of the Captain of the Towns Guard… Pyschkurewuss definitely used many other methods to consolidate his influence and wealth. In just three decades, the Count Turan house had amassed enough power to rival the Marquis Genos house."<br/>
"… Yes."<br/>
"That’s why we need a revolution! In any case, the wealth of the Count Turan house is supported by fuwano and mamaria. If we can turn the cheap and easy to cultivate poitan into the staple food in Genos, that will cut Count Turan’s wealth by half. The wealth won’t just flow into the Count Taliem house, but will be returned back to the people too!"<br/>
Polarse’s eyes were sparkling.<br/>
"And, of course, the poitan farmers and the Count Taliem house will benefit the most. As I mentioned, poitan is very cheap. Fuwano costs 1.5 times more than poitan of the same weight."<br/>
"Yes, that’s roughly how much it costs."<br/>
"That’s right! Fuwano isn’t that expensive, so the daily cost isn’t too much. However, this adds up over time, and the Genos residents can use the money they saved to buy other items, and lead a more prosperous life."<br/>
"But the people in the Turan County will become poor."<br/>
"Yes, but the people working in the Turan orchard are slaves that don’t get paid. The wealth generated by these slaves all falls into the hands of Pyschkurewuss. The citizens in the Turan county perform jobs unrelated to mamaria and fuwano, so it won’t affect them too much."<br/>
I recalled that Michael worked in a coal shop in Turan.<br/>
It was true that Michael didn’t seem as well off as the people in the Post Station Town.<br/>
"Such a grand scheme would definitely be supported by the Count Satolas house that rules the Post Station Town. My father and brother won’t object either! And finally… Marquis Marstein Genos believes in meritocracy, so he won’t have any problems if we take down the Count Turan house in a legitimate way."<br/>
"However, will things go so smoothly? Even if the taste and nutrition are similar, the people who had fuwano as their staple food for many long years…"<br/>
"We don’t need to completely overturn that. The arrogant people from the city won’t change so easily. However… The people from the Post Station Town and farms won’t look down on cheap food! And it will depend on how we promote it too."<br/>
I looked back at Zashuma.<br/>
Zashuma shrugged with smiley eyes.<br/>
Did Kamyua plan all this…?<br/>
I sighed softly, and this scene didn’t escape Polarse’s eyes.<br/>
"Are you worried? I feel uneasy too! But if we don’t do anything, Lord Pyschkurewuss will learn sooner or later that poitan can be cooked deliciously. Then, Pyschkurewuss will just get mad at the Forest’s Edge. In that case, it will be safer to spread this technique out quickly before he can even get mad."<br/>
"I see… I think I understand what you mean."<br/>
"Leave the troublesome matters to me! I’m scared of being assassinated too! Let’s spread the greatness of poitan all over Genos before Lord Pyschkurewuss notices!"<br/>
Polarse concluded with a bright smile.<br/>
After Polarse left with his three guards, I said to Ai Fa: "It feels like we just discussed something very serious…"<br/>
Ai Fa tilted her head and said: "Is that so?"<br/>
"I don’t think it is disadvantageous for us. Like we discussed previously, it’s dangerous for only one person to know this special technique."<br/>
"You mean during the house head conference when you taught the Tsun clan women how to cook, right? But the scale is completely different this time."<br/>
"I think it will have a big impact on the town."<br/>
"It can’t be helped. More importantly, it might pull the other nobles to our camp. Since Pyschkurewuss’ wealth won’t last forever, this might be possible too, right?"<br/>
Zashuma touched the mask on his face.<br/>
"Malfreed might be a model law enforcer, but he is too inflexible. Strong conviction in law alone isn’t enough to bring those who flout the law to task."<br/>
"Yes…"<br/>
"Like what we did yesterday, we have to depend on Sir Polarse. When I informed Sir Malfreed about the situation yesterday, he only promised to search Pyschkurewuss’ manor, but will do so by the books. He probably wouldn’t have taken any actions until noon today."<br/>
Who knew what would have happened to me by then.<br/>
I thought Zashuma’s judgment was timely and sound.<br/>
"Anyway, just leave the troublesome matters to us. The things we can do are limited too, but you just need to do your work properly like before."<br/>
Zashuma left after saying that. Milano Mast then came in:<br/>
"Time’s almost up. I have customers, can they come in?"<br/>
"Ah, yes. Sorry for troubling you again."<br/>
"You are always apologizing. Instead of being apologetic, try not to trouble others in the first place."<br/>
I didn’t know how to answer him.<br/>
Milano Mast looked pissed since yesterday.<br/>
"So, you are going back already?"<br/>
"That’s right. The tribal chiefs should be back from Turan county now, so I want to ask them about the situation."<br/>
I visited the 《Kimyusu’s Tail Inn》 last because I wanted to chat properly with Milano Mast. I decided to tell everything to him clearly.<br/>
"Erm, whether my business in the Post Station Town can continue will depend on the results of that meeting. Can I keep the same relationship with you from now on too, Milano Mast?"<br/>
"… I already rented pushcarts to Forest’s Edge denizens, why should I turn down your request?"<br/>
"No, not just that. I’m also teaching you to cook right now."<br/>
"Isn’t that a service you are providing without any remunerations?"<br/>
"No, I hope to sell fresh kiba directly too, so it’s a business to me."<br/>
Milano Mast took off his cylindrical hat and scratched his brown hair.<br/>
"The one who caused the trouble is the noble, you did nothing wrong. And lately… We have been in your care, so how should I face you?"<br/>
"Ah, no, I’m sorry if I caused you any inconvenience."<br/>
"… As I said, don’t bow your head so easily."<br/>
I had been acquainted with Milano Mast for quite a long while, but I was still very formal with him.<br/>
Was I still too immature, or was this just my personality… I cherished this stubborn old man with a wicked tongue as much as the forthright and kind Uncle Dora.<br/>
"In any case, my inn didn’t suffer much losses because of you. So don’t worry about this unnecessarily, and worry about yourself instead."<br/>
"Yes, thank you."<br/>
In any case, Milano Mast didn’t desert me. I exhaled quietly in relief and moved on to the next topic.<br/>
"Alright then. I wish to talk to you about cooking…"<br/>
I told Milano Mast that the plum-like mashed kiki was a suitable dipping sauce for "Kimyusu meatball".<br/>
Milano Mast put on his hat again and raised his other eyebrow.<br/>
"Dried kiki, huh. Many customers like to eat it as a drinking snack… This combination of yours is really absurd."<br/>
"I really recommend it. You just need to mix the crushed kiki fruit into the kimyusu, so please give it a try."<br/>
I finally put one of the things I learned in the city to use.<br/>
As I was thinking about that, Ai Fa tugged the corner of my T-shirt:<br/>
"By the way, what was that dish you cooked for me last night?"<br/>
"Hmm? Oh, that’s kimyusu cutlet."<br/>
"It has an incredible taste. Can you make that with kiba…?"<br/>
"Well, I will need to make slight changes in order to use kiba. I want to try making ‘Kiba cutlet’ too."<br/>
"Kiba cutlet…"<br/>
I turned back and asked Milano Mast:<br/>
"Erm, can we buy reten oil in the Post Station Town?"<br/>
"Reten oil? I only know that thing by name. It must be too expensive for me to buy."<br/>
"Is that so. What about karon milk and kimyusu eggs? Are they expensive?"<br/>
"There are plenty of eggs in the kimyusu shop. I often have them for breakfast."<br/>
"Why don’t you put them in the kitchen then?"<br/>
"Eggs are used as a substitute for meat. Only cheap inns would sell them to customers."<br/>
"Then… That means they are cheaper than meat. Cooking it together with meat is too expensive, but serving it alone seems too cheap, is that correct?"<br/>
"Yes, that’s about right. The poor might just eat eggs instead of meat for dinner."<br/>
"How much do they cost?"<br/>
Four of them cost one red copper plates.<br/>
The surprising thing was, they cost as much as poitan. In that case, I could think of them as a possible ingredient.<br/>
"What’s that about karon milk? There aren’t any madman who buys that in the Post Station Town. The nearest town with a karon ranch is Dabag, and it will spoil by the time it gets here."<br/>
"Isn’t Dabag just half a day journey from Genos? Karon milk can be kept for two to three days, and won’t spoil so easily."<br/>
But in terms of shelf life, karon milk was quite bad. The townsfolk were different from the nobles who had no qualms about throwing away food.<br/>
"I don’t know what karon milk can be used for, but it is definitely more expensive than fruit wine."<br/>
That was because the fruit wine sold in the Post Station Town was really cheap. At one red copper plate per liter, it was very reasonable.<br/>
Assuming one red copper plate was 200 yen, the poitan and kimyusu were 50 yen each, aria was 40 yen, a "Kiba burger" cost 400 yen, and karon thigh meat was 74 yen per 100 gram. The retail price would be 160 yen per 100 gram.<br/>
If fruit wine and karon milk were both 200 yen per liter, that would be a cheap price for the wine, while the milk would be a little expensive. When red wine and milk cost the same, it would feel like the red wine was very cheap.<br/>
Furthermore, the vegetable knife I bought from Shumimaru cost 36,000 yen, and the meat cutting knife from Dell cost 24,000 yen. Gilulu’s wagon cost ten times that of the meat cutting knife, showing how expensive steel was.<br/>
"If I can purchase karon milk at the price of fruit wine, I want to buy some. I just need to ask the meat seller from Dabag, right?"<br/>
"I don’t know. In this season, they probably visit every three days."<br/>
"I see. Thank you."<br/>
The next thing was whether I could make curd and nyuushi myself, and what to do with the skimmed milk. I would need to ask the Dabag merchants about that.<br/>
"A-And, where can I buy powdered fuwano from? The Turan county?"<br/>
"No need, there are fuwano shops in town. They are not in the marketplace, but in the streets where the inns are. You are using poitan… So why do you need to buy fuwano?"<br/>
"No, I just think that fuwano has its uses too, and want to buy some to do research."<br/>
I would be overwhelmed if I get too greedy, so that was enough for today. If I could buy eggs and fuwano from the respective shops, I could make more kinds of kiba dishes.<br/>
"Kiba cutlet" might be the first dish I will make.<br/>
I thought as I stole a glance at Ai Fa.<br/>
Just the thought of letting Ai Fa try my new dish made me feel blissed.<br/>
This was something that I couldn’t feel in that brick manor. It made me a little out of breath.<br/>
The people I cherished could enjoy the food I spent so much effort to cook. I could finally take hold of this blissful feeling again.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
3<br/>
After that, we returned to the Forest’s Edge settlement.<br/>
Regrettably, the innkeeper of the 《West Wind Inn》 was in a bad mood because I didn’t show up for the appointment. Yumi told me to give her father a few days to cool down. In any case, I was the one who didn’t show up for the appointment and had no grounds to complain.<br/>
And so, we returned to the Wu clan village when Leina Wu’s group was about to close for the day… and found Gilulu and another two Totos each drawing their own open-top wagons parked there.<br/>
The Totos and wagons belonged to the Zaza house and Sauti clan. The tribal chiefs returned before I did, and had gathered at the Wu clan village.<br/>
I steadied my breathing and walked to the Wu clan main house together with Ai Fa and the others.<br/>
"Dad, we are home."<br/>
Ludo Wu opened the door. I saw the scene I was expecting to see after entering the Wu clan and turned tense.<br/>
Donda Wu, Jiza Wu, and Kaslan Lutim.<br/>
Graff Zaza and his male follower.<br/>
Dali Sauti and his male follower.<br/>
And the house heads of the Fou and Bemu houses.<br/>
Nine men sat in a circle with complicated expressions on their faces.<br/>
"Oh, Asuta of the Fa house. Great to see that you are safe."<br/>
The first to speak was Dali Sauti, the young head of the Sauti clan and one of the three tribal chiefs.<br/>
His plain face had a gentle expression, and his body was larger than Jiza Wu and Kaslan Lutim. He was friendly towards the Fa house and worked hard to learn bloodletting and butchering techniques.<br/>
"Hello, long time no see. Erm, sorry for the trouble I caused…"<br/>
"Apologizing won’t help with what had already happened. If you feel responsible, sit down."<br/>
Graff Zaza cut me off with his slurred voice.<br/>
He was a middle-aged man wearing the hide of a kiba head, the head of the Zaza house cum tribal chief. His sharp feral gaze could rival Donda Wu, and of all the veteran hunters gathered here, he was the biggest and most menacing one.<br/>
He was a member of Forest’s Edge, but he was opposed to the Fa house’s business. For Ai Fa and me, he was someone we had to be careful of. Anyway, Ai Fa and I sat beside the head of the Fou house, opposite the Wu clan members.<br/>
Shin Wu and the other four young escorts had left, while Ludo Wu stood to Donda Wu’s left.<br/>
"The meeting with Pyschkurewuss has concluded."<br/>
Kaslan Lutim spoke on behalf of the rest:<br/>
"He said the punishment of the criminals will be decided by a trial. But we can conclude with confidence that Pyschkurewuss himself wasn’t involved in this incident."<br/>
"Is that so. Was Lifuria interrogated too…?"<br/>
"Of course. The ones who abducted Asuta are her minions, and they are the ones who decided to use unlawful means… However, Lifuria was the one who stopped Asuta from going home and imprisoned him to the manor. Malfreed who was in attendance said that she would be at least be sentenced to confinement."<br/>
Confinement… Would she be locked up in a prison cell or something?<br/>
She might be the mastermind, but she was just a ten years old girl. The thoughts of that weighed heavily on my heart.<br/>
"The criminals Moose and Sangjura would be given lashing. Because Pyschkurewuss pleaded for a lighter sentence, they won’t be exiled from Genos."<br/>
Dali Sauti shrugged and interjected: "How ridiculous. The sentence can be reduced by using the money. We can’t understand their way of doing things at all."<br/>
"We also can’t accept that the one most responsible had the lightest sentence. Forgiving their subordinates in spite of their crimes, aren’t they equally sinful?"<br/>
"That is true. In any case… The criminals will be punished with accordance to the laws of Genos."<br/>
Since this was the judgment of Malfreed who had absolute conviction in the law, we could only accept this.<br/>
Leaving Moose who was from the city aside, the elusive Sangjura being able to move freely during this time was worrying.<br/>
"Also… Did you mention the fact that Sangjura is the son of Pyschkurewuss?"<br/>
"We did, but Pyschkurewuss denied it. He insisted that Sangjura was just hired to survey the situation in the Post Station Town and outside Genos. And also… He scouted out Asuta’s stall because he was intrigued by Asuta’s fame in the Post Station Town."<br/>
"I see…"<br/>
Everyone turned silent for a moment.<br/>
As if he was waiting for this opportunity, Graff Zaza said: "So, what are your plans from now on, head and hearth tender of the Fa house?"<br/>
Ai Fa who was seated with the others had one knee propped up had a sharp gaze in her eyes:<br/>
"If the three tribal chiefs permit it, we hope to continue running our business like before. This isn’t just for a prosperous life, but also to build a cordial relationship with the people in the Post Station Town. Isn’t that the right path for the Forest’s Edge too?"<br/>
"I concur with Ai Fa. The previous incident has been resolved… But we should think of the city and the Post Station Town as separate groups."<br/>
Kaslan Lutim said in support of Ai Fa.<br/>
"Like us, the people in the Post Station Town can’t enter the city without an entry pass. Furthermore, the ones ruling Genos are the nobles in the city, so… Compared to the nobles, Forest’s Edge denizens are more similar to the people in the Post Station Town, is that correct?"<br/>
"You actually think that the townsfolk are more similar to us…?"<br/>
"Yes, or rather, their standings are closer to ours; that might be easier to understand. I don’t think it is right for the denizens of Forest’s Edge and the people of the Post Station Town to look down at each other. I have been visiting the Post Station Town and interacting with them in the past few days, further cementing my impression of that."<br/>
As usual, Kaslan Lutim was mature and calm, but his eyes were as strong as Ai Fa’s.<br/>
"The people in the Post Station Town don’t criticise us for sentencing our former tribal chief Zattsu Tsun. I think Asuta and Ai Fa have straightened the twisted relationship we had with the Post Station Town. That’s why I think the Fa house should continue their business in the Post Station Town."<br/>
"… But don’t forget that the Wu clan can only take on the escort duties for a few more days."<br/>
The one who said that was Jiza Wu, who was seated to the right of Donda Wu.<br/>
He might be finding the Fa house’s action more dubious, just like Graff Zaza. I held my breath on reflex.<br/>
"The Wu clan has entered the offseason for half a month. The grace of the forest had not replenished completely, but the famished kiba should be appearing soon. At the most, the escort duties will only continue until the 15th of the White Month. After that, the hunting of kiba will be our top priority."<br/>
"That is only natural. Those without duties will start preparing for the hunt from tomorrow onwards, correct?"<br/>
Jiza Wu nodded in response to Ludo Wu’s words.<br/>
"If the tribal chiefs think the Fa house’s actions are right, we will respect that decision. However, we can’t neglect our hunting work to help them. What are your thoughts on this?"<br/>
"That… is only natural. Like what Jiza Wu said, if we can’t uncover the true nature of Pyschkurewuss during the conference on the 15th… It will be hard to imagine the business continuing."<br/>
Ai Fa answered a little bitterly.<br/>
What Jiza Wu said made sense. When we were guarding against an attack by Tay Tsun and the others, Forest’s Edge had to set aside their hunting work to act as escorts because Pyschkurewuss gave the order to not rest.<br/>
But right now, I was doing business on my own volition. I couldn’t trouble the Wu clan any more after their offseason ends.<br/>
And if we weren’t mistaken about Pyschkurewuss, we had to continue operating with escorts. If the issue couldn’t get resolved on the 15th of the White Month and got postponed further, we won’t be able to continue our business.<br/>
Jiza Wu looked at Ai Fa and me with his narrow eyes that seemed to be ever smiling. The head of the Fou house then said:<br/>
"When that time comes, the other hunters in their offseason can take over the escort duties. In a month or so, the Fou, Lan, and Sudora houses will have their offseason, so we can just wait until then."<br/>
I looked back in surprise.<br/>
Amongst the buffed group of hunters, the relatively slender head of the Fou house was looking at us with determined eyes.<br/>
"Right now, there are 6 escorts on duty for both morning and the afternoon, correct? The Fou, Lan, and Sudora houses together can provide this number."<br/>
"H-However… Pardon me for saying this, but the Fou and Lan houses don’t have that many free hands, right? Even if they don’t need to hunt, they still need to help the women with their chores, right?"<br/>
"Just leave the chores to the men staying behind. We can’t help Asuta by sending women to help with your store, so nothing will make us happier than helping you this way."<br/>
"… Will it be fine to give your word without consulting the Lan and Sudora house heads?"<br/>
The head of the Bemu house butted in.<br/>
In contrast to the Fou house head, he was a short middle-aged man with a stout body. He participated in this tribal chief meeting as the representative of the minor houses that were against the Fa house’s actions.<br/>
"It’s fine. The Lan house is the kin of the Fou house, and the Sudora house is more eager to help the Fa house than us. And… The Latzu house would enter their offseason soon. If they take up the escort duties, the Fa house can continue with their business after resting for a few days."<br/>
Ludo Wu said energetically: "Asuta, you will need to keep doing your business with guards, right? You have guts, but I don’t think you should run your stall without escorts."<br/>
Ludo Wu was relatively serious today, but he had a happy smile that I hadn’t seen in a while.<br/>
"I think we should teach that damn Pyschkurewuss a lesson before the next meeting. If that happens, the minor houses won’t have the chance to escort the Fa house, but the safety of the Fa house is the top priority, correct?"<br/>
"Yes, it will be the best if we can remove any source of danger for Asuta and the others."<br/>
Kaslan Lutim said carefully: "However, we don’t have proof of Pyschkurewuss’ wrongdoings. If Kamyua Yost can’t get any evidence, we can’t determine that Pyschkurewuss is guilty."<br/>
No matter how deep his bonds with the Fa house was, Kaslan Lutim would remain impartial.<br/>
Graff Zaza said in a deep voice: "… No matter what Pyschkurewuss’ true nature might be, we will need to decide on what to do with the Tsun clan by ourselves."<br/>
"The business can’t continue if this matter isn’t resolved. There’s no end in discussing this… As for the issue with the Tsun clan, let’s proceed with what we agreed on earlier."<br/>
"Huh? Have you decided on what to do with them?"<br/>
I gasped in surprise, and Graff Zaza glared at me.<br/>
But he wasn’t the one who answered me. It was Dali Sauti who was sitting opposite me.<br/>
"Our conclusion remains unchanged. Diga and Doddo who are guilty of prison break aside, Mida, Yamiel, Aura, and Zwei have already been punished with the stripping of their clan name, so there is no need to punish them further."<br/>
"I see. If that is so…"<br/>
"However, if the Genos landlord demands that they are to be punished further, we can’t ignore his orders either. Therefore, we have decided to bring Zuro Tsun and the six other members of the Tsun clan main house there, and let them speak for themselves."<br/>
"Ehh… You want to bring Mida, Yamiel Lei, and the others there? Wouldn’t that be dangerous? If Pyschkurewuss abducts them forcefully…"<br/>
Dali Sauti said calmly: "If they try to do that without any reason, we won’t comply with them, Asuta of the Fa house."<br/>
"But Marstein is the Genos landlord, while Pyschkurewuss is just his representative. If he demands that the Tsun clan should receive a harsher punishment, we can only listen to what the Tsun clan says before deciding on the gravity of their crimes."<br/>
"B-But, that’s just what Pyschkurewuss saying on the surface, his intention might be to revive the Tsun clan."<br/>
"That’s just what Yamiel Lei thinks. We have to figure out what the Genos landlord and Pyschkurewuss really think. And, of course… If their true intentions are detrimental to the denizens of Forest’s Edge, we won’t comply with them."<br/>
Somehow, I felt the tall Dali Sauti looked even bigger now. No, not just Dali Sauti. Almost everyone present was emitting bloodlust like a hunter before a sworn enemy.<br/>
"Asuta of the Fa house, we are almost at our limit."<br/>
"L-Limit?"<br/>
"That’s right. We can’t see the justness of a ruler from that noble named Pyschkurewuss. I think I said the same thing at the Wu clan village in the past… My thinking didn’t fade with time and had gotten stronger with time instead. I feel even more strongly now that we can’t let that man represent the Genos landlord."<br/>
Dali Sauti remained calm as he said this and wasn’t agitated at all.<br/>
"Malfreed should have informed the Genos landlord, Marstein, about the situation with Pyschkurewuss. If the landlord still refuses to take any action, can we assume that he is siding with Pyschkurewuss?"<br/>
"Yes, that’s right… Leaving his opinions aside, Marstein seems to have delegated everything to Pyschkurewuss."<br/>
"Then we have to judge the Genos landlord’s intent through Pyschkurewuss’ actions. If Pyschkurewuss attempts to abduct Zuro Tsun and the others through illegitimate means, we will resist with our blades."<br/>
"… And make Genos our enemy?"<br/>
Dali Sauti nodded slowly: "If the Genos landlord still thinks that there is no problem with Pyschkurewuss’ way of doing things, that’s how it will end."<br/>
"We have lived in the Morga Forest’s Edge for four score years. For us who knew nothing of old home in the dark jungle of the south, this is our only home. However… We can’t live under the rule of someone who isn’t fit to be our lord. Fortunately, we are all in consensus for this."<br/>
"Yes… I see…"<br/>
When Graff Zaza talked about abandoning Genos, Dali Sauti admonished him.<br/>
In less than ten days, the tribal chiefs met with Pyschkurewuss twice. In the meeting before the last, they confronted Pyschkurewuss directly, but Pyschkurewuss was evasive in his words, which made their distrust of Pyschkurewuss grow even further.<br/>
Kaslan Lutim said calmly: "Asuta, we don’t want to abandon our home. But if we don’t have such a resolve, we won’t be able to figure out Pyschkurewuss’ true intentions."<br/>
"Bring Zuro Tsun and the others there, and let them explain themselves. We will then observe what Pyschkurewuss will do or say, and respect the laws of Genos and see what Malfreed does. We will decide on what paths we should take after seeing what they do. If Pyschkurewuss doesn’t resort to violence, we won’t either."<br/>
"But wouldn’t they confiscate our blades at the conference venue?"<br/>
"Yes, that’s why we will have dozens of men guarding the outside of the venue. They will rush in if we blow the grass whistle."<br/>
So they had already discussed such details. I couldn’t help gulping.<br/>
"Just the sight of so many men will tell Pyschkurewuss our resolve. He probably won’t resort to violence that easily. We don’t want to die in vain either."<br/>
"That’s true…"<br/>
"The details have not been set yet, but I think we should spread this news in the Post Station Town."<br/>
"Huh? Post Station Town?"<br/>
"Yes, our issue with regards on what to do with the Tsun clan had already been told to the innkeepers through Asuta. But I think we should tell the townsfolk about the crimes committed by Pyschkurewuss and Zattsu Tsun, and the suspicion we have."<br/>
Graff Zaza asked befuddled: "… I don’t get what you are thinking. Is there a point in doing that?"<br/>
Kaslan Lutim turned back and said to him quietly:<br/>
"There are two reasons. First, I think the people in the Post Station Town have the right to know. Second, I don’t think we should start a fight with Genos without informing them."<br/>
"I’m asking you the rationale behind your thinking."<br/>
"Because I think the people in the Post Station Town who have suffered the tyranny of the Tsun clan have the right to know the truth. Especially those who lost their family, isn’t that only natural?"<br/>
The figures of Milano Mast and Leito appeared in my mind.<br/>
They must have learned the truth from Kamyua Yost. However, Zattsu Tsun murdered more than 30 people in the caravan, and their families had the right to know the truth too.<br/>
"One more thing, if we are going to oppose Pyschkurewuss, we should let the people in Genos know the reason and let them decide whether the Forest’s Edge or Pyschkurewuss is right… If the people side with Pyschkurewuss, we can conclude that we can’t stay in this place anymore."<br/>
"… Shouldn’t we go down the path we think is correct, no matter what others thinks?"<br/>
"Is that so? We are also the residents of the Genos territory. We risk our lives to hunt kiba and procure food from the farmers we protect to feed ourselves. If either side is harmed, this lifestyle will end. In that sense, even though we aren’t one tribe, on the grand scale of things, we are all fellow citizens residing in Genos, correct?"<br/>
"…"<br/>
"But we viewed each other with disdain over the past eight decades. If it is difficult for us to coexist, let us live without interfering each other. Zattsu Tsun’s group are the ones who caused our relationship with them to deteriorate over the last ten years. We need to clear up any misunderstandings in order to resolve our differences with the people of the Post Station Town."<br/>
I completely understood what Kaslan Lutim was saying.<br/>
The denizens of Forest’s Edge were too apathetic towards how others thought and their misunderstanding towards Forest’s Edge… I had doubts whether this was the correct thing to do right from the beginning.<br/>
However, how many people here could understand this point? I only knew of two, Dali Sauti and Ai Fa.<br/>
Dali Sauti said: "Well… At the very least, we have no reasons to oppose Kaslan Lutim’s proposal. If Pyschkurewuss is innocent, we would just be thought of as retards who suspected an innocent man. I’m actually suspicious of Pyschkurewuss, so I’m not afraid of that outcome. If I’m wrong, I will gladly accept being called a retard to atone for my ignorance."<br/>
"That’s complicated. Compared to that, isn’t it simpler to make the townsfolk our allies? Didn’t we share our plans with the people in town yesterday too?"<br/>
After hearing what Ludo Wu said, Kaslan Lutim replied with a smile: "Of course, some of us would think that too."<br/>
"Then I concur with Kaslan Lutim. The more allies we have, the better it is."<br/>
"Are the people in the Post Station Town on our side? No matter who the mastermind is, isn’t the Tsun clan the one that caused the damage to the Post Station Town?"<br/>
The head of the Fou house asked. Ludo Wu answered with a smile:<br/>
"That’s what we are discussing right now; we want to figure this out. The Genos landlord won’t be the only one deciding if Pyschkurewuss or us is at fault. The residents of Post Station Town who suffered losses also have the right to decide too."<br/>
"Yes…"<br/>
"Being fair is good. And we did allow Zattsu Tsun to escape. That Geta no longer bears a grudge against the denizens of Forest’s Edge. If he still hates us after learning the truth, there is nothing more for us to say to him."<br/>
"Ludo, how can you put it that way…"<br/>
Donda Wu spoke for the first time.<br/>
Ludo Wu looked at him with a grin:<br/>
"Why are you so quiet, dad? I thought you have fallen asleep."<br/>
"Don’t be ridiculous. Anyway… We have taken the path we believed in. We won’t hide anything from anyone. Since that’s what Kaslan Lutim concluded, let him do his thing."<br/>
"I’m fine with that."<br/>
Dali Sauti said, while Graff Zaza gave his silent consent.<br/>
The head of the Bemu house asked another question.<br/>
"Is there a possibility of Pyschkurewuss being innocent? I’m reluctant to trust that munto-like man."<br/>
"Well, that depends on what the other people present think. Graff Zaza, Dali Sauti, if we can’t prove that he is guilty… Then we will lose the right to lead our people."<br/>
Dali Sauti said casually: "Yes, that is true; I have no intention of going to war against the Genos lord at all. If it comes to that, I will resign from my position as tribal chief for leading our people down the wrong path. Depending on the situation… I might even have to offer my head to Genos as a criminal."<br/>
The head of the Bemu house narrowed his eyes suspiciously:<br/>
"I believe it won’t come to that… However, if we lose Dali Sauti and the other tribal chiefs, who will succeed you? You won’t suggest the Tsun clan take on the mantle of the tribal chief, correct?"<br/>
"That can be decided during the house head conference. Maybe you and the head of the Fou house will get elected?"<br/>
"T-That’s absurd…"<br/>
"We got chosen because our clans are the next strongest after the Tsun clan. But that might not be the right choice. If Dali Sauti, Graff Zaza, and I choose the wrong path, it is your job to impeach us, just like how we impeached Zuro Tsun."<br/>
Donda Wu showed a beast-like smile I hadn’t seen in a long time as he continued:<br/>
"If we don’t have such a resolve, the denizens of Forest’s Edge will repeat the same mistakes. It is the duty of every denizen to judge whether a tribal chief is worthy of his post."<br/>
"It is as you say. We failed to stop the tyranny of the Tsun clan, and we won’t make that mistake again."<br/>
Dali Sauti tidied his attire and said:<br/>
"Alright then, let’s wrap up that topic. If there aren’t any issues, I want to inform my clansmen before dark."<br/>
"I have something to report. I met that aristocrat Polarse again today."<br/>
I then recounted my meeting with him, and no one reacted positively.<br/>
Even if I told them about the cooking method for poitan, Forest’s Edge denizens didn’t have any comment about that. The only one who was interested was still Kaslan Lutim.<br/>
"So Kamyua Yost had such a plan up his sleeves. What a profound man."<br/>
"I don’t really understand, but the source of Pyschkurewuss’ power is his wealth. If Pyschkurewuss loses his wealth, he will lose his influence; is that right?"<br/>
Dali Sauti asked while scratching his head, and I replied with a nod: "That’s correct."<br/>
"In any case, we would have trouble rescuing Asuta without Polarse’s help. If his actions don’t breach the taboos in Forest’s Edge, we don’t have any objections."<br/>
Donda Wu, Graff Zaza, and Dali Sauti seemed to agree on this.<br/>
"That concludes this meeting. The Fou house and Bemu house will inform the other houses as usual…"<br/>
Before Dali Sauti could finish, someone opened the door from the outside.<br/>
"Who is it?"<br/>
Donda Wu asked, and a voice answered: "I’m Shin Wu from the branch house. Someone from town has visited the Forest’s Edge and requests an audience with the tribal chiefs."<br/>
"Someone from town…?"<br/>
The people in the hall turned tense.<br/>
"What’s going on? No… It’s too hasty to go like this. Ludo, open the door."<br/>
Ludo Wu nodded and approached the entrance with a blade in hand. The Wu clan’s guests had all surrendered their blades.<br/>
We were seated at the lowest seat, closest to the entrance. Ai Fa cautiously got up on one knee to protect me. I could peek at the visitors through the gap between Ai Fa’s soft waist and arms.<br/>
There was a tall figure and a petite figure. I didn’t know the tall figure, but I have met the small one before.<br/>
"Sorry for the wait, friends from the Forest’s Edge. I’m sorry for coming back so late."<br/>
"Leito! So it’s you!"<br/>
Soft brown hair, bright brown eyes, and with a traveling cape covering his body, Kamyua Yost’s disciple Leito looked at me with a smile.<br/>
Then the one standing beside him must be his escort, a "guardian". His dark brown hair was tied behind his head, and his buff body could rival a hunter from Forest’s Edge. He looked like a strong middle-aged man.<br/>
He was also wearing a cape similar to Leito and had an old leather chest guard, with a crescent sword sheath on his waist.<br/>
"Kamyua Yost’s attendant, huh. Since you are here… That means he achieved his goal, right?"<br/>
Leito nodded in response to Donda Wu’s words. The boy must have had a strong heart to be capable of smiling in the face of such a large hunter from Forest’s Edge.<br/>
The big man beside him was like a guardian lion statue. His face was filled with wariness and doubt as he observed Donda Wu and the others.<br/>
"So, where is your master? And have the branch house members returned safely?"<br/>
"No, Kamyua and the Wu clan members aren’t back. The town guards set a roadblock to the north of Genos, which made things tense there. We are the only ones who made a detour and came back."<br/>
"Hmmp. So the significant other of that bandit boss is still outside Genos, huh."<br/>
Leito answered: "No."<br/>
"Kamyua might not be able to return before the 15th of the White Month, so we are the only ones who came back. I’m sorry… but can you hide the important witness with you until the day of the conference?"<br/>
"Hiding a woman from town in this village? That woman won’t be able to stand it."<br/>
"Is that so? I think it will be fine."<br/>
Leito looked at the big guy beside him with a smile.<br/>
That big guy snorted:<br/>
"Goram’s significant other can’t be a frail woman. I don’t know what kind of people live in the Forest’s Edge, but they can’t be as ferocious as a Gaje leopards."<br/>
Gaje leopards are beasts that live on the Marsala mountain where hunters like Geta hunt for prey.<br/>
Geta’s mother was probably a hunter, just like he said.<br/>
However… The voice of that big guy sounded like glass shattering and was hard for me to hear clearly. If he shouted menacingly, his voice would probably be like Donda Wu’s rumbling thunder-like voice.<br/>
"So, can we entrust this to you? Pyschkurewuss probably doesn’t know that we have returned to Genos, so we need to exercise extra care to avoid trouble."<br/>
"Before you rumble any further, bring that woman here. I will answer you after seeing her."<br/>
"Well… Allow me to introduce her."<br/>
Leito pointed at that big guy with an innocent smile:<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
"This is the significant other of the ‘Red Beard Gang’ boss Goram, Barcia of Marsala. We will leave her in your care for the next five days."<br/>
"Please take… Erm, do I need to bow too?"<br/>
With a terrifying gong-like voice that "big guy"… or, more accurately, Red Beard Goram’s spouse, Barcia, asked with a smirk.<br/>
And, of course, I wasn’t the only one stunned beyond words.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
4<br/>
Night.<br/>
Ai Fa and I lodged in the empty house in the Wu clan village again.<br/>
Ai Fa was adamant about going home tonight, but Donda Wu said that it would be more appropriate for us to stay in the Wu clan village until the 15th of the White Month.<br/>
"Isn’t the Fa house in a place far away from all the other houses? If dozens of enemies surround your house, can you protect your family?"<br/>
After being told that, Ai Fa could only bite her lips.<br/>
And right now, she was pouting unhappily. The way she leaned against the wall, with one knee propped up, face turned to the side and pouting, was far from the image of a dignified house head. Instead, she looked as adorable as a child.<br/>
There was another reason why Ai Fa was displeased. Aside from us, there were four other people lodging in this house.<br/>
They were Ludo Wu, Shin Wu, Barcia, and Leito. Aside from us, these people were also ordered to live under the same roof as us.<br/>
"But, Asuta, you can rest in the main house, right? Dad also said it’s safer there. We can watch these guys."<br/>
Ai Fa didn’t respond to Ludo Wu who was telling us all that. The more people staying in the same house as her, the unhappier Ai Fa would get.<br/>
In any case, I found it hard to stay calm too.<br/>
"Hmmp. There are so many cuties here. Does the clan head intend to entertain me, since I lost my husband when I was young?"<br/>
Barcia who was seated in the middle of the living room drank fruit wine as she laughed heartily. It had been several hours since I met her, but I still couldn’t believe she was a woman.<br/>
When I mistook Dell for a boy, I was lectured by everyone, but I was confident that no one would fault me this time.<br/>
Firstly, she was really big. She was 180 cm tall, had wide shoulders, a buffed build, and the muscles in her arms and shoulders were like small mounds, making her as swole as Jiza Wu or Kaslan Lutim.<br/>
She had bindings around her chest under her tunic, but I couldn’t tell she was a woman from that. She sat cross-legged on the floor with a fruit wine bottle in hand and observed us fearlessly. At a glance, she looked no different from the mercenaries and ruffians I often saw in the Post Station Town.<br/>
"You seem rather skilled, but don’t try anything funny. Even if you are our guest, I won’t let you off if you do something strange."<br/>
After being called cute, Ludo Wu responded angrily, while Barcia just shrugged and said: "You are a scary kid."<br/>
"I know you are not as cute as your appearance suggests. I’m honored by how wary you are of me, even though I’m alone."<br/>
Ai Fa, Ludo Wu, and Shin Wu had their blades with them, while Barcia’s scimitar was safekept in the main house.<br/>
I also checked with Ai Fa right from the start, and she said: "Barcia isn’t as strong as her son."<br/>
But she didn’t seem to fear the hunters of Forest’s Edge and looked resolute and arrogant at times.<br/>
She stared at Ai Fa and me with her dark eyes that had a strong gleam in them.<br/>
"Well then, it’s time for me to get about my business. You are… Ai Fa and Asuta of the Fa house, right? Have you spoken with my son, Geta? Tell me everything you know of my wayward son."<br/>
"Okay. In the Forest’s Edge, we are probably the ones who had interacted with him the most."<br/>
Ai Fa was still moody, so I was the one who answered.<br/>
It seemed that Barcia came to Genos to search for her son.<br/>
"After all this time, I don’t intend to seek revenge for the head of my family anymore."<br/>
Barcia already said so during the day.<br/>
"We were a gang of bandits. People might have called us righteous thieves, but we still violated the law. The reason behind the execution didn’t match up, but our gang was still guilty. When Goram was caught by the guards, that was the end of the road for him."<br/>
After losing her fellow gang members and lover, she brought her infant son to the Marsala mountains to live in seclusion. It wasn’t easy to live as a hunter in the mountains where dangerous beasts roamed, but she managed to make a living.<br/>
"But I wished for my son to live proudly, so I weaved the story of his father Goram into lullabies and sang them to him since he was a baby. But it caused the opposite effect."<br/>
After learning the skills of a hunter, Geta felt he should avenge his father for being framed. However, his mother didn’t permit it. He then left his home and hunted alone in the Marsala mountains, and didn’t appear before his mother again.<br/>
She continued to live as usual, hoping her son would calm down and return to her. But Geta trained his skills in that one year and came to Genos alone. He heard from peddlers that his father’s enemy, the denizens of Forest’s Edge, had started doing business in the Post Station Town… and it was the fuse that led to his reckless actions.<br/>
After hearing that, Barcia leaned her face towards me and said: "… Then, you must be the denizen of Forest’s Edge that is running the business."<br/>
Her face seemed to have the feel of cured leather and looked yellowish brown from tanning. Her eyes were large, and her eyebrows were almost gone. Her nose and mouth were very large, and her jaw looked tough enough to crush kiba bones. She looked around 35 years old and had a dignified face like a stone guardian lion.[2]<br/>
"The Forest’s Edge denizens who framed the ‘Red Beard Gang’ were outlaws that were more terrible than a bandit gang. Detestable outlaws like them would be executed by the people from the city one day, even if we leave them be. That’s what I always told Geta."<br/>
"I see."<br/>
"However, there was news that Forest’s Edge denizens have started doing business in the Post Station Town in Genos and even gotten rave reviews. So my stupid son got mad and said that Forest’s Edge denizens won’t ever be punished for their crimes."<br/>
Geta did say something like that. That was why he targeted my stall, huh.<br/>
"Anyway, Kamyua Yost told me a lot on the way here, so I won’t bear any grudge against you all. Also… With how good your cooking tastes, it’s only natural for it to earn rave reviews. I never thought that I could eat such a sumptuous meal in the forest."<br/>
I helped with dinner preparations tonight too.<br/>
Earlier, Barcia cleaned her plate with an appetite that rivaled Donda Wu. She showed a ferocious smile, before reverting back to a serious expression.<br/>
"However, the mastermind is actually a noble, which makes things complicated. Even Geta can’t escape unscathed when facing nobles."<br/>
"That’s right. But Geta said he won’t do anything before we uncover Pyschkurewuss’ crimes. We have to think of a way to deal with Pyschkurewuss for Geta’s sake too."<br/>
"Ehh, for Geta’s sake?"<br/>
"Yes. If the denizens of Forest’s Edge can bring Pyschkurewuss to justice, Geta won’t need to do it himself."<br/>
"Fufu, you people have a strong sense of duty."<br/>
"Rather than a sense of duty… Even if Pyschkurewuss is the mastermind, the Tsun clan from the Forest’s Edge was still involved in this crime. So it’s only natural for us to feel responsible."<br/>
I was conscious of Leito who was standing beside Barcia. He was the son of the wiped out caravan’s band leader who fell victim to Zattsu Tsun’s crime, the crime which the ‘Red Beard Gang’ was framed for.<br/>
"I think the Forest’s Edge denizens have atoned for their sins when Zattsu Tsun and the others confessed to their crimes. Moreover, the other denizens of Forest’s Edge are also victims of their tribal chief’s betrayal."<br/>
"We didn’t really do much. Before Kamyua took action, we didn’t even realize the crimes committed by Zattsu Tsun and his company."<br/>
Ludo Wu said unhappily, but Leito’s smile didn’t change.<br/>
"Didn’t you impeach the Tsun clan before Kamyua took action? If the Tsun clan was still the tribal chief back then, wouldn’t the Forest’s Edge be in an even tighter spot now?"<br/>
"… Don’t you hate us?"<br/>
"My father’s murder by Zattsu Tsun happened before I was born. My mother passed away shortly after, and my relative Milano Mast also didn’t say anything about the villain of the Forest’s Edge, so I don’t think of myself as a victim."<br/>
But he shed a tear when Zattsu Tsun was apprehended. Did Ludo Wu see that too? Ludo Wu stared at Leito who was smiling innocently and scratched his blonde hair.<br/>
"Isn’t it tiring to live like that?"<br/>
"Well, I’m too young to feel tired."<br/>
There probably weren’t any other ten-year-olds in this world who would answer this way.<br/>
"You make things sound complicated."<br/>
Barcia frowned.<br/>
"Back to the topic, did Geta show up in this village before?"<br/>
"When I last spoke with him, he made it sound like this was goodbye forever. But his attitude towards the denizens of Forest’s Edge was bad, so it’s hard to say."<br/>
"But didn’t he went out of his way to search for you after you got locked up by the nobles? I’m not proud of this or anything, but he isn’t someone who will go that far for someone he didn’t know."<br/>
Barcia looked at me and continued:<br/>
"So he likes you that much, huh… Or did he feel guilty for bearing a grudge against innocent people?"<br/>
"He took it very hard upon finding out that the Forest’s Edge villain was also manipulated by others."<br/>
I thought back on that time in front of the Fa house, when Geta’s face was on the verge of crying.<br/>
But with all those responsible dead… Who should I point my blade at…?<br/>
Geta said that back then.<br/>
I didn’t think seeking revenge was the right course of action.<br/>
However, Geta, Barcia, Leito, Milano Mast, and others all lost their families because of the scheme of unsculpturous people with insatiable greed.<br/>
Zattsu Tsun and the others paid for their crimes ten years later with their lives. But if there were still criminals not brought to task, we couldn’t just leave them be.<br/>
"But I don’t think getting someone like me to show up will be enough to incriminate the nobles."<br/>
Barcia said after taking a big swig of fruit wine.<br/>
"Who can be sure that the ‘Red Beard Gang’ has never committed murder? I was a member of the ‘Red Beard Gang’ before the birth of my son too. I don’t think the people in the city will believe the words of a former ‘Red Beard Gang’ member."<br/>
"But you did come into contact with the people in the city, right? That’s why Kamyua wants you to be a witness to prosecute Pyschkurewuss’ wrongdoings."<br/>
This was a new fact I just learned today.<br/>
Before the ‘Red Beard Gang’ was framed, they came into contact with Pyschkurewuss’ henchman.<br/>
"I can’t tell if he is from the city though. His attire just seems very extravagant."<br/>
"But that person did coerce others to attack the envoys from Banam, right? Pyschkurewuss probably planned to use the ‘Red Beard Gang’ to do his dirty work before he used Zattsu Tsun to do that… Kamyua told me that."<br/>
This was brought up for discussion with the tribal chiefs during the day.<br/>
Pyschkurewuss was planning to control the ‘Red Beard Gang’, and formed a subjugation unit when that plan fell through.<br/>
He was probably planning to use both the ‘Red Beard Gang’ and Zattsu Tsun at first, but when his plan to rope in the ‘Red Beard Gang’ failed, he had to use just the difficult to manipulate Zattsu Tsun instead… Who knows what the exact details actually were. In any case, that was his attitude towards the ‘Red Beard Gang’.<br/>
"There’s one thing I don’t really understand."<br/>
I decided to bring up some doubts I had during the day.<br/>
"This might be information only people from the ‘Red Beard Gang’ or Pyschkurewuss camp know. Even so, Kamyua was still confident right from the start that you are the key to victory. Just how did he learn of this secret?"<br/>
"It’s not a secret. Goram and I already knew Kamyua Yost."<br/>
"… What?"<br/>
"It had been ten-odd years when that fishy man said very suspicious things to us. That ‘guardian’ Kamyua Yost met my Goram in a tavern somewhere and hit it off. Maybe that blonde guy also joined the ‘Red Beard Gang’."<br/>
I turned gloomy.<br/>
Just how much did he intend to toy with others?<br/>
Leito looked at me with a smile again:<br/>
"Kamyua had wandered around the Western Kingdom for more than ten years. He visited so many places and met so many people that it even surprises me. Weaving all these meetings into a scroll he likes must be Kamyua’s raison d’être."<br/>
"Hmm… So this isn’t a coincidence, but something inevitable?"<br/>
"That’s right. After meeting hundreds and thousands of people, Kamyua selected the ‘Red Beard Gang’, me, Milano Mast, the Genos landlord, and others to create a scroll to defeat Pyschkurewuss. That’s how I understand it."<br/>
"I’m shocked. This is like the gods toying with the fates of men."<br/>
Barcia said unhappily, and Leito tilted his head adorably.<br/>
"And Kamyua recognizes that he is just a thread in all this. That’s why he always says with a smile that we won’t get the desired results unless we work hard for it."<br/>
"That blondie will definitely die a horrible death. Never mind, I’m not in any position to say that about others either."<br/>
After saying that, Barcia swept her gaze across the room:<br/>
"Anyway, it’s too reckless to defy the nobles in the Western Kingdom. There is no chance of winning, and my husband could only resist for a time by pretending to be the leader of bandits. In the end… he was executed."<br/>
"Yes, but Kamyua knows the Genos landlord Marstein and managed to pull the noble Malfreed to his side. If things go smoothly, we can rope in the Count Satolas house, that runs the Post Station Town as well, and isolate Pyschkurewuss."<br/>
After saying that, Leito looked my way:<br/>
"However, Kamyua didn’t expect the Forest’s Edge would get into contact with Polarse. The original plan was for me to contact Polarse tomorrow, in the place of Kamyua who can’t return to Genos yet."<br/>
"Right, as mentioned during the day, because of my negligence, we had to depend on that person."<br/>
"But that was incredible; Kamyua never thought that Pyschkurewuss’ daughter would do something like that. However, this served as the catalyst that turned the public opinion in the Post Station Town against Pyschkurewuss, so what Asuta went through wasn’t in vain."<br/>
So I should be happy about this, huh. Ludo Wu looked displeased.<br/>
But Leito still had a refreshing smile as he continued:<br/>
"This was similar to that time when Kamyua set a trap to capture Zattsu Tsun. Before Kamyua could put his plans into action, the Forest’s Edge denizens already steered the situation to a favorable outcome. We have a common foe, so even though your experience was unpleasant, I still think things are turning out to our advantage."<br/>
"Erm, little one, you might be Kamyua Yost’s disciple, but do you really have to mimic your master’s every move?" Barcia admonished Leito with a scary voice. "Nothing good will come from toying with the fate of others, you understand?"<br/>
"I have no intentions of toying with fate. I just think that I won’t be happy with the life that god has given me."<br/>
"I’m saying your attitude isn’t good…"<br/>
Barcia said with a frown and made a star-like gesture with her finger before her chest as she mumbled something. She was probably asking for the Western God’s forgiveness.<br/>
"In any case, the die has been cast. Kamyua will keep going until he brings Pyschkurewuss’ crimes to light."<br/>
"But Kamyua can’t make it back before the conference, correct? Isn’t Kamyua worried about entrusting everything to Zashuma and Malfreed?"<br/>
I interjected, and Leito showed a cute pondering face.<br/>
"The best outcome would be Kamyua coming back in time. But if the town guards that made camp to the north are a subjugation unit formed in order to arrest the bandits disguising themselves as denizens of Forest’s Edge… It will be hard to break through them."<br/>
"Is Pyschkurewuss trying to pin the crimes of the bandits on Kamyua and the Wu clan men with him?"<br/>
"I’m not sure, but when we were lodging in Banam city, news about the bandits have already spread. That’s why Kamyua already took precautionary measures."<br/>
Even when that man was that far away, he was still cooking up some scheme with a smile on his face.<br/>
A silence that felt exhausting engulfed us, and Barcia spoke loudly as if she was trying to break the silence:<br/>
"Your people are also involved in troublesome matters. Hunters just need to stay in the woods to avoid any trouble."<br/>
"Yes, but this has nothing to do with Kamyua Yost, this is between the Forest’s Edge and Pyschkurewuss… Given the situation, Forest’s Edge denizens will have to face this issue."<br/>
"Oh? That will be interesting. It’s rare to see several hundred outstanding hunters living in the mountains."<br/>
Ludo Wu reverted to his usual expression and leaned forth:<br/>
"By the way, you are a hunter too, right? Aside from Ai Fa, this is the first time I have seen a female hunter."<br/>
"Well, I was born in Marsala after all. I left my home when I was 18 and met Goram… After my new life didn’t work out, I returned back to my home despite having no family there."<br/>
"Fufu. But you aren’t wearing a hunter’s cape. The leopard hide cape that Geta was wearing."<br/>
"Gaje leopard hide, right? I can’t move freely if I wear that, so I left it at home."<br/>
Our discussion during the day was heavy, and everyone was getting tired of talking about Pyschkurewuss.<br/>
In any case, we traded all essential information. Donda Wu decided to provisionally trust Barcia and permit her to stay in the village. We just needed to wait for the 15th of the White Month now.<br/>
I relaxed my shoulders as I thought about all that. Ai Fa, who had been quiet all the while, suddenly spoke, which surprised me.<br/>
"Barcia of Marsala, did you… inherit the bloodline of a hunter from birth?"<br/>
Barcia scratched her chiseled jaw and said to Ai Fa:<br/>
"It’s not really the heritage of hunters or something. I was born in the Marsala mountains, but I only hunted critters like baro baro birds. I got acknowledged as an adult after killing a Gaje leopard when I was 15."<br/>
"… I was 15 too when I hunted my first kiba."<br/>
"Oh, kiba are ferocious beasts just like Gaje leopards, right? It’s amazing that you managed that with your slender limbs."<br/>
Barcia laughed happily.<br/>
"But your eyes are determined, just like a hunter. There aren’t many female hunters in Marsala either. Hunters like me don’t need to do strenuous labor, but it is still difficult for a woman to hunt in the forest."<br/>
"… You…"<br/>
"Hmm, what?"<br/>
"It’s nothing but… you are a hunter, but you had a child?"<br/>
I held my breath.<br/>
"Didn’t I mention it just now? I gave birth to Geta after leaving Marsala. I lost all my family to the Gaje leopards, so I couldn’t marry anyone and left my hometown. I was scouted by the ‘Red Beard Gang’ and joined them. Less than two years later, Geta was born… And then my husband and my gang members all died, so I decided to live on as a hunter."<br/>
"… I see."<br/>
For some reason, my heart skipped a beat.<br/>
No… I already knew why. Like what Ludo Wu said, aside from Ai Fa, she was the first female hunter I met.<br/>
I overlooked this because I was too focused on Pyschkurewuss… And because Barcia was more buffed than the shorter men.<br/>
"Basically, Marsala female hunters don’t hunt again after giving birth. The woman can’t hunt for several years after childbirth and will lose her skills gradually over this time."<br/>
"Is that so."<br/>
"However, I always had strength that can rival the men. Without any skills to make a living, I worked hard to regain my skill as a hunter."<br/>
"… I see."<br/>
"If not for Geta, I couldn’t have worked so hard. Because I had that child, I didn’t lose my reason for living."<br/>
"…"<br/>
Ai Fa had a very expressive face.<br/>
The light in her blue eyes seemed really troubled. I felt like I was sitting on pins and needles, and looked to the others.<br/>
Leito was listening to their chat with a smile.<br/>
Shin Wu who was calmer than Ai Fa looked out the window, staying on guard.<br/>
And Ludo Wu… locked gazes with me and winked cheekily.<br/>
I shook my head and sighed softly. That didn’t ease my mind at all.<br/>
"By the way, I need to stay in this village until the 15th of the White Month, right?"<br/>
Ai Fa didn’t say anything, so Barcia shifted her gaze to Ludo Wu.<br/>
"We just don’t want you to go to town; you won’t be confined to the Wu clan village. Hmm, the nobles probably won’t send people to infiltrate here in broad daylight, but staying put at home is the safest."<br/>
"Don’t joke with me, it’s too boring to stay in for four days."<br/>
"Tell that to my Dad. Never mind… If you are bored, how about chopping some firewood or doing something else?"<br/>
Ludo Wu was probably kidding, but Barcia looked delighted.<br/>
"Right, I won’t complain if you can let me work out my body. I can’t rest easy if I just sleep and eat without doing anything. Kid, can you ask your Dad to not let me feel bored?"<br/>
"I’m not a kid, I’m Ludo Wu."<br/>
"Ah, that’s rude of me to treat an outstanding hunter like a child. Ludo Wu, I will be counting on you."<br/>
Ludo Wu then laughed happily:<br/>
"You are a strange one. Compared to the normal people in town, you are probably closer to us."<br/>
"Because I’m half a hunter; I abandoned my hometown before and can’t say things like my soul will return to Marsala… But compared to the bustling towns, I feel more comfortable in the mountains."<br/>
Barcia did have a unique aura that was different from the townsfolk and hunters.<br/>
She wasn’t as pure as Forest’s Edge denizens and seemed very free-spirited. Rather than fearing the nobles in the city, she seemed to think it was foolish to interact with them.<br/>
As for losing her husband and hunters offering their soul to the forest… She probably felt the same way. She looked so boisterous not because she was cold-hearted, but because of how tough she was mentally.<br/>
"Anyway, let’s leave tomorrow’s troubles for tomorrow. It’s getting late, let’s turn in."<br/>
Ludo Wu stood up with his blade.<br/>
"Yes, it’s almost time to have a good sleep."<br/>
The others also got up one by one.<br/>
Ludo Wu looked down at Ai Fa and me who had no intentions of getting up.<br/>
"Asuta and Ai Fa will be sleeping in the living room, huh? There are so many rooms here, you two are strange."<br/>
"… The Fa house only has one storage room, so we have always been sleeping in the living room."<br/>
"Is that so. Do what you will; just ignore us."<br/>
Ludo Wu started whistling as he left with the other three.<br/>
There was a corridor down the living room that led to the rooms where Barcia and Leito were resting. Donda Wu still didn’t completely trust Kamyua Yost, so Ludo Wu and Shin Wu would take turns watching them.<br/>
Only the two of us stayed behind in the living room.<br/>
The silence was heavy.<br/>
"Well… Let’s sleep too."<br/>
"Yes."<br/>
Ai Fa answered me but didn’t move at all. Her blonde hair was still tied up.<br/>
With no other choice, I lied down and started thinking. Even if female hunters in Marsala were acknowledged by others… and even if Barcia continued hunting after having a child, all that had nothing to do with us.<br/>
I didn’t have the resolve of getting married in this world yet.<br/>
And Ai Fa had already resolved to offer her life to the forest.<br/>
And so, we thought our relationship was the right path… Probably.<br/>
But… Is that really true?<br/>
Only Ai Fa knew what she was actually thinking. And I still haven’t sorted out my mind yet.<br/>
I might disappear from this world at any moment. I didn’t even know how I got here. And I didn’t have the resolve to start a family given these circumstances.<br/>
And, what kind of resolve would I need to make?<br/>
With my fleeting existence, how was that different from dying at any moment?<br/>
Up until yesterday, I spent several days without Ai Fa. Life felt surreal then, and it was more painful than I imagined. If I couldn’t see Ai Fa ever again, would I regret it?<br/>
I hid my feelings of not wanting to lose Ai Fa in my heart and stopped myself from crossing the final line because of ethics and morality… But would I really not regret it?<br/>
At this moment, I felt a warmth from my back.<br/>
I already expected it, so I wasn’t surprised. But my heart was still pounding.<br/>
"Don’t speak."<br/>
I heard Ai Fa’s voice behind me.<br/>
Ai Fa leaned closed to my back and held my shoulders tightly.<br/>
"I’m very happy with Asuta by my side." Ai Fa said quietly. "The time I spend with Asuta feels satisfying. That’s how I really think…"<br/>
I answered in my heart that I felt the same too.<br/>
I made the resolve to welcome this blissful future.<br/>
But was Ai Fa seeking an even greater happiness?<br/>
These questions stabbed deep into my heart, that was how this night was like.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
