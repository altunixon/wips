<br/>
I’m running out of ideas to use for the title, I should probably use the actual chapter titles…….<br/>
Being companions to the Hero of the Spear<br/>
Firo:"Ah, Master~!"<br/>
When I returned to the main island hotel, Firo came out to greet me in her demon form.<br/>
I thought I told her to stay in her human form at the hotel.<br/>
Woman1:"See you. Keep your distance though."<br/>
Naofumi:"I know."<br/>
Woman 1 says good-bye to join up with Bitch.<br/>
Naofumi:"So what happened?"<br/>
Firo:"Uhmm you see, Raphtalia onee-chan got angry."<br/>
Naofumi:"Angry you say……"<br/>
Motoyasu, you’ve finally caused a problem.<br/>
The person in question was sitting there stargazing while pressing his cheeks together.<br/>
I wonder why. It feels like he’s deep in thought.<br/>
Woman1:"Motoyasu-sama?"<br/>
Woman 1 is dumbfounded, as she sees Motoyasu like that.<br/>
……I don’t understand the situation. What’s going on?<br/>
Naofumi:"Firo, what happened?"<br/>
Firo:"Hm~? Firo doesn’t know."<br/>
Thought so.<br/>
I am an idiot for asking Firo<br/>
Can’t be helped,I’ll go look for Raphtalia, Motoyasu can be left to Woman 1.<br/>
And there she is. Her back is turned, but it is clearly Raphtalia…… even from a distance, it’s obvious to me that Raphtalia is fuming.<br/>
The hair on her tail is bristling, and her body is emitting enough magic power to make the air around her vibrate.<br/>
Naofumi:"I-I’m back."<br/>
Ratphalia turned around when she heard my greeting, and the anger seemed to have dissipated.<br/>
Raphtalia:"I was waiting!"<br/>
Raphtalia rushes towards me with a tearful expression.<br/>
Naofumi:"Wh-What happened?"<br/>
I pray that it is not rape.<br/>
I don’t think that is the case based on Motoyasu’s reaction, but I have no idea what is going on.<br/>
Raphtalia:"That’s–"<br/>
I’m told about Raphtalia’s experience.<br/>
Raphtalia tries to explain to me what happened from her point of view.<br/>
Firo:"What’s happening?"<br/>
After I left, Firo asked Raphtalia anxiously.<br/>
Raphtalia:"It’s alright. All we are going to do is hunt demons with the other hero-sama until tomorrow night."<br/>
Firo:"Boo~. What about master?"<br/>
Raphtalia:"We’ll join him a bit later."<br/>
And so, the situation was explained to Firo. Raphtalia was doing push-ups while waiting for Motoyasu to arrive.<br/>
I will explain. Because it has already become a routine, I forgot about it, whenever Raphtalia has free time, she trains her body.<br/>
During our travels on the carriage, when not tanning demon skins, chin-ups and push-ups are performed.<br/>
Recently, her arm strength has increased to the point where single fingered pushups are possible.<br/>
The physical training influences her status. Little by little, her status increases.<br/>
Motoyasu:"Sorry for the wait–"<br/>
Motoyasu walks in the room with a bouquet in one hand.<br/>
Firo:"Munya~……"<br/>
Firo is taking an afternoon nap.<br/>
Raphtalia:"677……678……"<br/>
Raphtalia wasn’t paying attention and continued doing push-ups.<br/>
(sfx) Rustle* Motoyasu dropped his bouquet.<br/>
Well, entering the room of a girl who is waiting for you, only to see her doing push-ups, Motoyasu was left speechless.<br/>
Motoyasu:"Ummm……"<br/>
Raphtalia:"680……Ah."<br/>
Raphtalia stopped doing push-ups and turned to face Motoyasu.<br/>
Raphtalia:"Welcome. Hey, Firo, get up. He’s here."<br/>
Firo:"Muu……Firo is sleepy."<br/>
Motoyasu:"Ah, right……"<br/>
While picking up the bouquet, Motoyasu enters the room.<br/>
Raphtalia:"My best regards until tomorrow."<br/>
Firo:"Best regards~!"<br/>
Motoyasu:"Gotcha, we have already met,but let’s introduce ourselves again. I am Kitamura Motoyasu! Hero of the Spear. Please take care of me."<br/>
Raphtalia:"Raphtalia."<br/>
Firo:"Firo"<br/>
Motoyasu fashionably hands the bouquet to Raphtalia.<br/>
Motoyasu:"These flowers suit you cuties well."<br/>
Raphtalia:"Haa……"<br/>
Raphtalia receives the flowers and, it seems she was thinking of where to sell it.<br/>
Was it bad that I raised a girl with efficiency as a principle?<br/>
Furthermore, Raphtalia heard that flowers could be made into medicine.<br/>
I think it was an aromatic drug.<br/>
Firo:"This isn’t very tasty."<br/>
Firo puts some flowers in her mouth.<br/>
Well, Firo prefers dumplings over flowers.<br/>
Raphtalia:"Now then, shall we go Level up at once?"<br/>
Motoyasu:"Let’s go shopping at the market first."<br/>
Raphtalia:"I guess……"<br/>
Thus, Raphtalia followed Motoyasu to the market.<br/>
Raphtalia:"This shop……It’s closed."<br/>
Motoyasu:"That’s strange. I could’ve sworn it was selling accessories a little while ago."<br/>
It seems Motoyasu wanted to browse the store that was closed.<br/>
After a little looking around, it was revealed that they were just a little late.<br/>
Motoyasu:"Oh well, let’s look at various others."<br/>
Raphtalia:"Ah, okay."<br/>
Like that, following Motoyasu, various shops were visited.<br/>
Several hours were spent at the market.<br/>
Moreover, he would stay and talk to any pretty girl.<br/>
Random Girl:"Eh! You are the Hero of the Spear-sama?!"<br/>
Motoyasu:"That’s right. Is there something you want to ask of me?"<br/>
It seems they wanted to ask the hero to show off a few spear tricks.<br/>
As a result, each girl gave him a note with the hotel they were staying at.<br/>
Skirtchasing.<br/>
While watching his gentleman act, Raphtalia’s evaluation of Motoyasu fell.<br/>
And so, after shopping…… the day was almost over.<br/>
After shopping and leaving the market, Motoyasu walked in the direction of the pier.<br/>
Raphtalia:"Um……To go back we have to return from the market."<br/>
Motoyasu:"It’s fine It’s fine, let’s take a look."<br/>
Raphtalia:"Eh? But, today’s leveling……"<br/>
Motoyasu:"Oh right, Firo-chan. Can you return to your angel form?"<br/>
Firo:"No!"<br/>
Since leaving the hotel, Firo has been in her demon form.<br/>
Afterwards, they went to the tourist spots of Cal Mira Archipelago main island, when the sun began to set, they moved to another island.<br/>
Crossing the middle of the sea during a setting sun, on a small boat.<br/>
Motoyasu:"I found something good in the shop a little while ago."<br/>
A souvenir made with a shell was handed to Raphtalia.<br/>
Raphtalia:"Umm……"<br/>
Motoyasu:"Don’t worry about it, it’s just a small present."<br/>
By the way, Firo was swimming next to the ship in her demon form.<br/>
It’s a situation I can easily imagine.<br/>
I was listening to the story with a delicate expression.<br/>
Ignoring Bitch being violent at first, we listened to the story quietly. Firo didn’t have to be there though.<br/>
Motoyasu:"Look, the setting sun is beautiful."<br/>
Raphtalia:"Yes, it is beautiful."<br/>
The scenery of a setting sun on the ocean is beautiful for Raphtalia. There was a mood, from the aquatic sea demons jumping out of the sea with the evening sun in the background.<br/>
While Raphtalia was staring blankly into the evening sun, Motoyasu grasps her hand.<br/>
Rejecting it, Raphtalia pulls her hand back.<br/>
Motoyasun just shrugs his shoulders with a feeling of "Don’t worry about it".<br/>
At that time some veins appeared on Raphtalia’s forehead.<br/>
Afterwards, she just smiled at Motoyasu, while not letting him grasp her hand.<br/>
After arriving at the island.<br/>
The sun already set. Raphtalia was preparing for a night battle against demons while Motoyasu dashed into the hotel.<br/>
Raphtalia:"Um……’<br/>
Motoyasu:"Hm? What’s up?"<br/>
Raphtalia:"Are we not going to Level up?"<br/>
Motoyasu:"The day is already over you know. It would be dangerous to fight in such a situation."<br/>
Raphtalia:"W-Well……But-"<br/>
Motoasu:"Now, let’s have a meal and take a good rest at the hotel. I’ll make dinner, so look forward to it."<br/>
Raphtalia consented and bought various ingredients at the market place.<br/>
Rapthalia also bought various light medicines, such as a heal ointment.<br/>
Firo:"Food?"<br/>
Motoyasu:"That’s right Firo-chan. So take your angel form."<br/>
Firo:"No!"<br/>
Firo was in her demon form while cautiously watching Motoyasu.<br/>
She used to kick him in the groin a lot.<br/>
After that, Motoyasu started cooking in the hotel’s kitchen while showing off to the two of them in the corner.<br/>
Raphtalia seems to have thought that I would eat the food provided by the hotel.<br/>
Well, I didn’t cook unless we were outside. I was making medicine and accessories at the inn. Recently, I have also been studying magic.<br/>
Motoyasu:"The food I cooked is ready."<br/>
Raphtalia:"S-sure……"<br/>
Motoyasu announced to Raphtalia while the dish was still sizzling,<br/>
Raphtalia ate Motoyasu’s food slowly, while Firo ate heartily.<br/>
Firo:"It isn’t as tasty as Master’s!"<br/>
Raphtalia:"Shh! Hero of the spear-sama will mind it……"<br/>
After hearing that Motoyasu has a cramp in his smile.<br/>
Motoyasu:" I’ll make even tastier ones if you want. So, Firo-chan, Angel form!"<br/>
Firo:"No!"<br/>
Just how much of an angel-lover are you.<br/>
After that, they entered seperate rooms. At that time, Firo finally returned to her human form.<br/>
Well, it’s because I ordered Firo to be in human form whenever we were at an inn, to avoid damaging the place.<br/>
Firo:"Not sleeping yet?"<br/>
Raphtalia:"Not yet……"<br/>
Before sleeping Raphtalia streches and studies magic.<br/>
Motoyasu:"Wa! Firo-chan’s angel form is so cute!"<br/>
Firo:"Stay away!"<br/>
It seems Firo hates Motoyasu.<br/>
Did Motoyasu do something that Firo hates?……He has.<br/>
Before Firo grew up, he called her lame and laughed out loud.<br/>
Furthermore, calling her a fat and plain bird. It would be weird if he wasn’t hated.<br/>
Raphtalia:"Don’t worry, nothing will happen."<br/>
Firo:"Really?"<br/>
Raphtalia:"Really Really."<br/>
Firo:"Muu~……"<br/>
Firo lies on the bed in human form and breathes deeply.<br/>
But her ahoge is standing on end, and she isn’t sleeping soundly.<br/>
Motoyasu:"……"<br/>
Motoyasu silently approaches Firo.<br/>
Raphtalia:"……What do you intend to do?"<br/>
Motoyasu:" I just want to look at Firo-chan’s sleeping face."<br/>
Raphtalia raises her eyebrows at Motoyasu’s suspicious actions.<br/>
Motoyasu:"Anyway, while Firo-chan is sleeping, want to drink some liquor in a bar?"<br/>
Raphtalia:"What?"<br/>
Motoyasu:"Ah, you never drink alcohol before. Don’t worry, just have a little and enjoy the charm of being an adult."<br/>
Raphtalia:"Charm……huh"<br/>
Unexpectedly, Raphtalia was tempted by Motoyasu speaking about charm, and followed him to the bar.<br/>
While sitting down, Motoyasu orders the liquor.<br/>
It arrived after a few minutes.<br/>
The first drink was for Raphtalia. It seemed to be some red alcohol.<br/>
Motoyasu pours it into a glass.<br/>
Motoasu:"A toast to your eyes."<br/>
Raphtalia:"……"<br/>
When Motoyasu winked fashionably at Raphtalia, something inside her seemed to have snapped.<br/>
Raphtalia:"There are things to do tomorrow, I’m returning."<br/>
While suppressing her urge to kill with a smile, the cup containing the alcohol she didn’t drink vibrated with magic released from the body.<br/>
Motoyasu:"Eh? Ah-"<br/>
Like that, she returned to the hotel with the spare key and slept.<br/>
And, the next morning.<br/>
Raphtalia:"Good morning."<br/>
With the intentions to forget yesterday, Raphtalia greeted Motoyasu.<br/>
Motoyasu:"Ah, good morning. Raphtalia-chan. Firo-chan."<br/>
Firo:"Morninn-"<br/>
Firo sleepy returns the greeting with a yawn.<br/>
After having a light breakfast at the hotel, it was finally time to hunt demons.<br/>
However……<br/>
Motoyasu:"I understand your strengths."<br/>
After a while of hunting demons, that line was said.<br/>
The demons aren’t very strong, after advancing for a while, Motoyasu called for a stop.<br/>
Raphtalia:"What?"<br/>
Motoyasu:" Leveling up with such bloody fighting doesn’t suit your lovely selves. Why don’t you watch me fight?"<br/>
Raphtalia:"Huuh!?"<br/>
After saying that, Motoyasu rushes a demon that appeared alone.<br/>
By the way, if it was Firo, that demon would have been small fry.<br/>
It also should have been dealt with by a single blow from Motoyasu.<br/>
Motoyasu:"Meteor Spear!"<br/>
Certainly, Motoyasu is strong.<br/>
But he kept sending amorous glances, some how causing his sweat to glitter, and winking whenever a demon was killed.<br/>
Motoyasu:"How was it?"<br/>
Raphtalia:"———–p!"<br/>
Raphtlia’s patience finally reached the limit.<br/>
Raphtlia:"I don’t know, so please stop it!"<br/>
It seems her head blanked out, and it seems that afterwards Motoyasu was shaking like a lamb.<br/>
while repressing her anger with a straight face, they returned to the main island hotel a little before noon.<br/>
By the way, Raphtalia and Firo only got 2 levels, so presently they are at 42.<br/>
What the hell, yesterday I got 6 levels, and am now level 44.<br/>
I wonder why Raphtalia is lower level than me……<br/>
Motoyasu……This is even less than what I expected.<br/>
I feel that there is some kind of conspiracy, but I can’t tell based on the story I just heard.<br/>
Anyway, Raphtalia’s evaluation of the Hero of the Spear dropped fatally.<br/>
