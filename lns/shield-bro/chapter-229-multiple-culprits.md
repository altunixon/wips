Multiple Culprits<br/>
Ren: "Itsuki…"<br/>
Ren mutters his name bitterly.<br/>
I wonder how I should deal with this matter.<br/>
Atla will probably be able to find Itsuki’s location.<br/>
Soldier: "There, there’s trouble!"<br/>
A soldier from the castle burst into the dining room.<br/>
He was covered in wounds and his clothes were in tatters.<br/>
Naofumi: "What happened?"<br/>
Soldier: "Large scale riots have broken out at one of the towns! Its terrorism aimed at the populace"<br/>
Naofumi: "What did you say?"<br/>
Soldier: "Its a emergency request from Melty-sama! Hero! We need your strength!"<br/>
There are more riots than Firo can take care of?<br/>
The scale of their attack must be massive.<br/>
Naofumi: "I understand!"<br/>
Ren: "Can I come with?"<br/>
Ren stepped forward with his request.<br/>
Hmmm.<br/>
It would be simple to let Ren accompany me.<br/>
And the Female Knight can also come along…<br/>
But, something is bothering me.<br/>
Imia’s uncle was attacked by bandits, Kiel and the others were abducted, the village was targeted with poison, Imia’s Uncle was controlled, and a riot broke out in town.<br/>
Their timing is too good.<br/>
If this was a planned attack, then why?<br/>
The purpose behind the enemy’s motive…<br/>
The Queen’s story about the Church of the Three Heroes, seems to be connected with Itsuki.<br/>
Perhaps, the riot at the town is just a clever diversion.<br/>
Which means.<br/>
Naofumi: "Its possible that there will be an attack targeting Melromark castle"<br/>
Ren: "Wha-"<br/>
Ren looked pale.<br/>
Well, its not too surprising.<br/>
I will not let the malicious acts that transpired here be repeated.<br/>
Now that I think about it, the people carrying out these acts could be manipulated just like Imia’s Uncle.<br/>
What could be done to stop all of this?<br/>
For now, the only method for the brainwashing is to use Shield Prison to seal them off, nothing else would work.<br/>
But, the problem is that the scale is too big.<br/>
I would have to take into account the magic consumption and the cool-down, as well as finding the ones that Itsuki was controlling.<br/>
Just like Ren, he could be corrupted by a curse, but someone must have given him the idea.<br/>
But, manipulating him would be difficult.<br/>
It could be similar to Ren, where he keep on repeating what he believed in.<br/>
Just what kind of person is Itsuki.<br/>
He has an usually strong sense of justice, yet he is also conceited.<br/>
How would one manipulate such a guy?<br/>
Naofumi: "Ren, this is a hypothetical. But what would someone have to do to manipulate a Hero of Justice?"<br/>
Ren: "Eh? …Wouldn’t you just need a villain?"<br/>
It was such a simple textbook answer, but it is believable.<br/>
Furthermore, he targeted both my land and Castle town for his acts of turmoil.<br/>
Then his target would be either me…or the Queen.<br/>
Now, I try to think of his intention.<br/>
If he was in a place where he could see the messenger go out for help…then there is a good chance the enemy is in Castle town.<br/>
Motoyasu: "Father-in-Law. I have returned"<br/>
Oh? Motoyasu had returned just at the perfect time.<br/>
He suddenly appeared through the use of a portal.<br/>
Naofumi: "Oh! Motoyasu, I know its sudden, but can I ask you to do something?"<br/>
Motoyasu: "What would you like me to do, Father-in-Law. Even if it is an act of evil, I, Motoyasu will gladly serve you."<br/>
Naofumi: "…I need you to go to the castle in Melromark and check its situation. If a problem were to arise, crush it. Motoyasu, I also want you to go with your Philorials."<br/>
Motoyasu: "Understood, Father-in-Law. I, Motoyasu, will stake his life to carry out this task! Let us go, my angels!"<br/>
Having just returned, his three followers, obeyed Motoyasu’s order with a slightly tired expression.<br/>
I take it that you guys spent your time running around sightseeing.<br/>
The real problem it that we can’t identify the target of Itsuki’s attack.<br/>
Even with a large military force, our enemy would be able to advantage of it.<br/>
Motoyasu proved that ones conciousness could be altered, and at worst Firo may end up in the hands of the enemy.<br/>
Ren: "So should I go too?"<br/>
Naofumi: "No, Ren should stay here. Just in case"<br/>
Spreading my forces too much would be dangerous.<br/>
We would have walked into a trap if it wasn’t for my earlier foresight.<br/>
Motoyasu: "Then let us depart!"<br/>
Followers: """Yes"""<br/>
Taking his Philorials, Motoyasu headed towards town.<br/>
The portal is not usable during its cool-down, but he should be fine since he runs fast.<br/>
With this I hope nothing happens, but…<br/>
Afterwords, I go to see if the Cage of Shields had dissipated.<br/>
Imia’s Uncle: "My deepest apologies! Please forgive all the inconveniences I have caused!"<br/>
Having arrived, Imia’s Uncle bowed his head down in apology.<br/>
Imia is also with him.<br/>
Naofumi: "Don’t let it bother you. More importantly are you alright?"<br/>
Imia’s Uncle: "Y-yes!"<br/>
Naofumi: "Can you explain to us what happened?"<br/>
Imia’s Uncle: "Yes"<br/>
As I though, Imia’s Uncle was attacked the day before.<br/>
He recalled that there was a sudden attack from the bushes that he was unable to avoid.<br/>
Did it cause that scar I saw at the clinic?<br/>
Huh, it didn’t look like an arrow mark…<br/>
From that point his memories became hazy, but he continued to fight until his mind became muddled.<br/>
He began having mixed thoughts that the bandit wanted to help him, even though he was an enemy.<br/>
He then escaped the fight, but he vaguely remembers protecting Elena.<br/>
Naofumi: "He escaped?"<br/>
Imia’s Uncle: "…When he left, I felt relieved. Then on my way back with Imia…I recalled our arrangement to intentionally bump into a person"<br/>
Naofumi: "It was arranged?"<br/>
Imia’s Uncle: "Yes. I believe it was at that time I was given the medicine"<br/>
Of course, what he gave you was really poison.<br/>
Brainwashed into using the poison, Imia’s Uncle was tasked with poisoning the well with his own hands.<br/>
It would be quite troublesome to make these arrangements, but it avoided suspicion.<br/>
To have planned that elaborately ahead, must have been difficult.<br/>
Imia’s Uncle: "Then I was to put the entire village to sleep with sleeping pills, and during that time-"<br/>
Naofumi: "Wait…sleeping pills?"<br/>
If the poison wasn’t discerning enough, there were also sleeping pills.<br/>
An appraisal of the poison showed that it was a moderate toxin, and when taken it would affect the repository system.<br/>
Most would die suffering upon taking it, it was truly a horrible thing.<br/>
It was quite a severe way to die. It would have caused them to suffocate to death.<br/>
Did you make a mistake in using the sleeping pills?<br/>
There is a large difference between the testimony and reality.<br/>
However there was still something puzzling.<br/>
There was the Demi-Human slave whose death was disguised as a suicide.<br/>
If Itsuki is behind this, according to Imia’s uncle story, he would have finished him with the brainwashing.<br/>
But even though he had a slave crest he wasn’t brainwashed. The reasoning behind this, is something I don’t know.<br/>
Was the slave crest placed simply because I used them as my subordinates.<br/>
Or was it for a completely different reason.<br/>
…What if there were multiple culprits?<br/>
If he isn’t working with anyone then, its likely Itsuki is being manipulated by someone.<br/>
That wouldn’t be surprising. Itsuki is just a big lump of justice. He would hate such evil deeds.<br/>
Well, if it was for the sake of justice he could probably do it.<br/>
The possibility that Itsuki is corrupted by the Curse series is also very high.<br/>
In fact, compared to Ren and Motoyasu, Itsuki’s mental damage seems to be the highest.<br/>
Its probable that Itsuki can’t suppress the feelings caused by the curse, since it consumes your will and is virtually impossible to control.<br/>
That would mean that those controlled by Itsuki’s brainwashing couldn’t be controlled by others.<br/>
He would probably say it was for the sake of justice or something.<br/>
Even though the use of the sleeping pills and poison would be unforgivable, for the sake of justice he would allow it.<br/>
Lets think about the facts.<br/>
Itsuki and the three other groups… the remnants of the church, the revolutionaries, and the missing Witch and her companions, most likely one of these groups are acting separately.<br/>
It is unclear if they are cooperative relationship, but there is not doubt they are involved in this turmoil.<br/>
Each of them work on different ideologies which means the enemy wouldn’t be under a united leadership.<br/>
Which means, Itsuki could have been given those sleeping pills and poison by another party.<br/>
While being corrupted by the curse, it wouldn’t be strange for him to ally himself with one of the groups.<br/>
Assuming that there are four groups, including Itsuki, their targets would be our footholds.<br/>
My village, the Town and Melromark Castle.<br/>
A considerable force would be needed to overwhelm the three at the same time.<br/>
Of course, it would be impossible for the Remnants of the Church and the Revolutionary Faction.<br/>
And there were people brainwashed by Itsuki at all three locations.<br/>
Me, Melty, and the Queen.<br/>
From these three, one will be targeted for death.<br/>
After some planning, Ren is going to head to the town, while I defend the village.<br/>
Since the power to brainwash is already well known, Ren will be careful.<br/>
Naofumi: "Please continue"<br/>
Imia’s Uncle: "From them on…I’m not sure"<br/>
Naofumi: "Hmmm"<br/>
The question is, after knocking out the villagers with the sleeping pills, what would be his next step.<br/>
They could attack using a force controlled by Itsuki.<br/>
Itsuki may have also thought the poison and the sleeping pills would be enough.<br/>
The group that is behind Itsuki, uses poison as their main method of elimination, or am I wrong to assume so?<br/>
Otherwise their actions are just too random.<br/>
After all, the reason the used they poisoned the village was to weaken our war potential.<br/>
Which would mean, Itsuki is a puppet.<br/>
Even if he isn’t working with anyone, Itsuki would be unlikely to use the sleeping pills in the first place.<br/>
Actually, the poison used by Imia’s Uncle when he was controlled and the one the culprit used for the river was different.<br/>
After using the pills and forcing me to deal with the riots in town, just what was he going to do?<br/>
The answer was obvious. I wouldn’t have to think hard to figure it out.<br/>
Gaelion: "What about the Philorials and monsters?"<br/>
Gaelion: "Most of the Philorials went with the Hero of the Spear, but there were some that stayed"<br/>
Naofumi: "The remain Philorials, monsters and Gaelion. Along with the slaves, go suppress the situation in town. If you succeed, please act under the orders of the future queen Melty who is at location"<br/>
Gaelion: "Understood"<br/>
Philorial: "Kue!"<br/>
Gaelion: "And the others?"<br/>
…The truth is that it would be best for all forces to help out in town and leave the village empty.<br/>
Among my forces, there was one that could crush Itsuki and all his forces.<br/>
But if Itsuki were to come and capture this village, it would be difficult situation.<br/>
Honestly the Three Heroes Church and the revolutionary faction are not that big of threats.<br/>
If Itsuki was captured, we could undo the brainwashing.<br/>
Therefore, it would be best to solve this in the shortest manner possible.<br/>
In that case, walking into a trap wouldn’t be too bad.<br/>
Naofumi: "The others-"<br/>
<br/>
