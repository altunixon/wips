Epilogue<br/>
<br/>
The problem with the Maini House was discussed in the mansion of the Bagan House.<br/>
But, it was also a fact that a dungeon existed and they had no leeway to concern themselves with other matters. It seemed that the Maini House decided to leave the case unresolved this time.<br/>
It seemed they left the punishment for Zappa-san to Dale-san.<br/>
Inside the Bagan House’s mansion──at the work room of the family head, Dale-san and I were checking the documents there. The records of the village that were left without anyone even reading it until now were piled up here. There were only two men inside this room that was covered with dust. It felt really lonely, but right now it’s better to stay beside Dale-san.<br/>
Dale-san was smiling bitterly.<br/>
「How embarrassing. Medard-san scolded me. Even though I wasn’t told anything, there are many ways to investigate it, he said. It couldn’t be helped that he was exasperated of me.」<br/>
The document I’m reading was left behind by the previous head. There, it was written why the leadership of the Bagan House headed together to war.<br/>
The Second looked at that and felt understanding.<br/>
『So they really intended to open up the forest to connect this place with Dalien with a highway. The highway will also connect to the Maini House’s village, and also the city of the Viscount house……I see, they intended to make a road for the connecting coach to pass.』<br/>
Looking at the map, certainly if they could make a road here there would be a lot of territories that would be helped. If the road can go until Dalien, the passengers could also transfer to connecting coach that goes to Central from there.<br/>
The Third showed interests in this plan.<br/>
『It’s a small village. If there was a highway passing through here then it will really develop. That’s why they were forcing themselves to persuade the surroundings. They used the war as a reason to take the higher-ups who were disagreeing with that plan to go look at villages or settlements that had a highway passing through them……it looked really hard to realize but, if this succeeded then this village will be able to obtain great revenue.』<br/>
The previous head and his eldest son participated in the war not for fighting, but more for fulfilling their duty to the Baron and then to have a discussion with the Baron about the plan going ahead.<br/>
They laid out the groundwork with the feudal lords of the surrounding territories, and they thought to show the success example to Paola-san’s father who was opposing the establishment of the highway.<br/>
And then, the document also mentioned about Dale-san in regards to the plan. There was the autograph of the previous head and his eldest son. They wrote that they would entrust the settlement that was arranged to be developed to Dale-san. We discovered evidence in the memo that they were trying to leave behind something for the hardworking Dale-san.<br/>
「……Dale-san, please read this one first.」<br/>
「Eh? O, okay.」<br/>
Dale-san who looked slightly haggard acted strange after giving his blessings to the marriage of Paola-san and Pini-san that was decided yesterday. He was putting on a brave front.<br/>
It seemed that he liked Paola-san, but apparently Paola-san clearly told him that she couldn’t marry with Dale-san who was a feudal lord.<br/>
「It looks like they were really in a hurry. It looks like they forced themselves to participate in the war because the previous feudal lord had his own thinking.」<br/>
It was the fact that they were forcing themselves, but it seemed they were also hurried on by the surroundings. Gathering funds, persuading the Baron, persuading the Maini House and their lord the Viscount. It seemed the plan had progressed until the stage where a place of discussion was set up.<br/>
Dale-san pressed his face.<br/>
「……I never heard anything like this, not even once. If only they told me.」<br/>
The Second spoke with a bit of thorn.<br/>
『Will he accept it if they told him? There was a large possibility of him opposing it due to him leaning too strongly towards the villager’s side. That’s why they progressed the plan without telling him. They also didn’t mention this to the villagers also must be because there was no groundwork to make them understand.』<br/>
Groundwork──it was how the villagers couldn’t imagine the profit from maintaining a highway. Maintenance for the highway that the connecting coach would run on was necessary.<br/>
The men of the village would receive money if they worked to maintain the highway. If an inn could be set up in the village, then the guests would spend money there.<br/>
If the cities of the Viscount and the Baron were connected, the village of the Bagan House would be neatly on that connecting path. Besides, there would be no need to take a troublesome detour anymore.<br/>
When Dale-san finished reading the document, he looked up to the ceiling. He was making a pained expression.<br/>
「……Zappa finally confessed. About how he was the cause of father and big brother’s death too. And how he caused problems because of his rash actions. I wonder what I should do now. Paola will marry Pini. Zappa cannot be left alone. ……Haha, I’m completely alone.」<br/>
Regarding Zappa-san, it was planned that he would be punished really strictly. Dale-san is worrying about what kind of punishment it should be. The Maini House, and then the Bagan House……to make both sides accept it, the punishment has to be heavy no matter what.<br/>
Zappa-san exposed both sides to danger. It seemed there wasn’t anyone who asked for Zappa-san to be spared. On the contrary, it will be troubling if Pini-san was gone, so there were people who appealed for his punishment to be reduced.<br/>
Perhaps this difference was from their habitual deeds.<br/>
But, Dale-san who would be the one to decide the punishment was suffering.<br/>
「……I have to punish someone who I’ve known for a long. In the end, I will be resented.」<br/>
How will the villagers think about Dale-san’s decision……would it be a proper punishment? The seeds of Dale-san’s worry were many.<br/>
The Third showed understanding to Dale-san.<br/>
『Something like this can happen, this is why getting along too well with others is also problematic. Well, he should get a wife quickly. A noble wife is necessary for a feudal lord.』<br/>
Isn’t it wrong to recommend someone who has only gone through heart break to marry?<br/>
When I made that kind of face, the Fifth told me.<br/>
『Something like love is secondary in marriage between nobles after all. Well, it’s also necessary to have a heir as soon as possible.』<br/>
The Third made fun of the Fifth.<br/>
『As expected from the person who had a wife and a lot of mistresses. What you are saying is different.』<br/>
『…..Leave me alone.』<br/>
A feudal lord is resented and misunderstood sometimes. People might think that they are living freely and prosperously, but that’s not really the case. I think that being a feudal lord is troublesome.<br/>
「…..Dale-san, what are you planning to do from now?」<br/>
「Let’s see. First I’ll go around to apologize and gives my greetings. It’s fine if it’s only little by little, I want to improve this village. First I’ll go to Medard-san’s place I guess.」<br/>
Hearing Dale-san saying that, I told him a slightly interesting story.<br/>
「Now that you mentioned that, it was Medard-san who taught us the shortest route when escaping from the orc. He seems to be really knowledgeable even though it was the territory of the Bagan House. Perhaps he had gone to that area a few times before?」<br/>
Dale-san recalled the situation.<br/>
「No, now that you mentioned it……why did he know……he had been there? But, that area is our territory since a long time ago……」<br/>
I smiled slightly.<br/>
「Can it become a material for negotiation? Well, that’s only after this side has shown sincerity first though.」<br/>
I’m saying that Medard-san too had done something that he couldn’t tell to other people. Certainly relationships between neighbors was really troublesome with so many things piling up on both sides.<br/>
「……You’re right. I’ll check it later. More importantly, you will return tomorrow won’t you? What about the right to challenge the dungeon first?」<br/>
I listened to the disappointed voices of the ancestors while answering Dale-san.<br/>
「Our equipment has become no good after the fight with the orc. The Viscount-sama should form a subjugation force while we prepare, so we’ll give it up this time.」<br/>
Zelphy-san’s equipment was worn out, and all of us were also in the same state. My saber also became no good.<br/>
Dale-san said thanks to me.<br/>
「Thank you, Lyle-kun. I’m glad that you came here. About when I tried to hit you……I apologize. Well, I think it’s wrong to surround yourself with many women though. Medard-san also agreed with me on that.」<br/>
When I went to Medard-san’s territory, it was always together with Sophia-san. Because of that he misunderstood that both of us had a loving relationship with each other.<br/>
「……I want to say my excuse but, first let’s finish the work here.」<br/>
I said that while looking at the piling up documents of the Bagan House.<br/>
.<br/>
The next day.<br/>
We who got on the wagon and returned to Dalien were making camp. We stopped the wagon at the side of the road and finished our meal. After that we took turns to keep watch until morning came.<br/>
Sophia-san and I were keeping watch of the surroundings. The time might be up because Sophia-san stood up.<br/>
「Aria came so I’m going back. ……Ple, please take care to not get cold.」<br/>
There was no conversation. Or rather, even when I talked to her, Sophia-san would only reply with 「Yes」 or 「No」 right away so the talk wouldn’t continue.<br/>
The Seventh was laughing inside the Jewel.<br/>
『How innocent. Perhaps she is feeling embarrassed.』<br/>
The Sixth was doubtful.<br/>
『Is that so? But, if she doesn’t come forward more, like this, then no one will be interested though.』<br/>
The Fifth was exasperated.<br/>
『If there’s no reaction from you, doesn’t that mean she is a good girl?』<br/>
What does that mean? While I’m thinking that, Aria-san came beside me.<br/>
Tonight was a full moon so the surroundings was bright and quiet. I can hear the sounds of insects. I’m using Arts to keep watch of the surroundings, but there isn’t any sign of an enemy approaching.<br/>
「……I’m sitting beside you.」<br/>
「Please.」<br/>
My relationship with Aria-san has also been awkward since my growth. It’s not in a bad sense. Her face turns red even when I talk to her.<br/>
We cannot convey anything to each other like that, so recently we would often talk with Novem or Zelphy-san between us.<br/>
「The, the full moon is bright isn’t it?」<br/>
The fire is making crackling sound. I poked at the fire and replied. The conversation didn’t continue from there and we kept silent.<br/>
「You are avoiding me aren’t you?」<br/>
Aria-san glared at me.<br/>
「That can’t be helped! You said things like destiny and so on to me like that! Aah, geez! Now I remember something strange.」<br/>
Something strange. That strangely bothered me. Thinking that it will be a starting clue for a conversation, I asked Aria-san.<br/>
「Something strange?」<br/>
「It’s a story of the Lockwarde House’s unrequited love. About this red Gem you know……it belonged to the ancestor who married into the Lockwarde House and it was passed down through generations to the daughters. Well, most of the times men would marry into our house, it seemed that we had a lot of girls in our family lineage.」<br/>
Now that she mentioned it, Aria-san’s father was also a son-in-law adopted into the family. I listened to the continuation of the story.<br/>
「The truth is, something like a red Gem would be better in a house of a military family, and yet why did the Lockwarde House have something like this then. On the surface the reason was so that the woman could fight in a hour of need but……actually, this is something that the ancestor couldn’t hand to the person who she loved.」<br/>
Person she loved. Those words strangely caught my attention. Aria-san mentioned about an ancestor marrying into the Lockwarde House. Alice-san who was the first love of the First came into mind.<br/>
「It’s a story of a really long time ago. In the kingdom’s calendar……around even before the first hundred years? The ancestor who married into the family had someone she loved. What’s more that person was from a noble house with a rank that only barely allowed them to pass down the title. He was the third son from that house.」<br/>
The Fourth leaked out his voice.<br/>
『Oho』<br/>
Aria-san continued.<br/>
「The ancestor was always strong-willed and lively, but she would look demur when in front of that person. She would behave like a lady but……that person, he volunteered into an expedition group. That was why, she wanted to give him something and she planned to present this red Gem that was popular at that time.」<br/>
The Third also seemed to notice.<br/>
『……Good grief, those two kept passing each other.』<br/>
「But then, in the end she couldn’t give it. And then, she didn’t even marry and waited for that person to come back to hand this Gem to him at that time. After that, she got to an age where she had no other choice but to marry. That was why, she brought the red Gem with her.」<br/>
The Second laughed slightly.<br/>
『Should I say that it was really like Oyaji, or……looking from the view of me as his son, this really gives me complicated feelings.』<br/>
「She never talked with that person up to that time. Furthermore, when she came to the mansion of the Lockwarde House she happened to see that person and there was a fuss or something……well, that kind of story was passed down until now. That’s why, it seems there is a precept from that ancestor, so that her daughter and granddaughter will properly convey their feelings to the other party. What do you think, strange right?」<br/>
I shook my head.<br/>
The era, and then the situation……there is no way that this could be someone else who was only in a really similar situation. I who had seen various things in the room of memories of the First thought that.<br/>
In other words, this is just like what the First said ──<br/>
『This meeting was fate. No doubt about it.』<br/>
──The Third said it a bit regretfully.<br/>
「It’s not strange. Besides that person in the story……it’s my ancestor.」<br/>
「Eh?」<br/>
「Is the name of Aria-san’s ancestor Alice-san? My ancestor’s name is Basil.」<br/>
Aria-san was surprised.<br/>
「Eh, yo, you know? E, eh?」<br/>
It seems it’s not a mistake. Aria-san is in confusion. I look up at the full moon and said.<br/>
「……This meeting is fate. I think it’s fine like that.」<br/>
The First’s feelings reached Alice-san. Or rather, it wasn’t unrequited love but mutual love, that’s amazing.<br/>
Furthermore, the two never even talked with each other.<br/>
Hearing the word fate, perhaps Aria-san remembered my after growth. Her face turned red and she averted her gaze. I laughed seeing that.<br/>
But, looking up to the sky I felt a bit sad. It would change nothing even if the First heard this story but, I wanted to tell him. No, perhaps it’s better that he didn’t hear this?<br/>
Certainly this meeting, it might be fate that continued from the First. No, not might, it was really fate.<br/>
Today the moon was really beautiful.<br/>
「……The moon sure is beautiful.」<br/>
Then, the inside of the Jewel became noisy. However, it was lacking.<br/>
『Oi oi, seriously?』<br/>
『No, isn’t this just Lyle not understanding what he is saying himself?』<br/>
『But those are famous words right? Though I don’t know whose words those are.』<br/>
『If he said that at this timing, then it’s amazing even if it’s a coincidence.』<br/>
『Lyle too is really something huh.』<br/>
『The problem is whether he himself knows it or not though.』<br/>
There were six voices. It was lacking one person.<br/>
Aria-san opened and closed her mouth. Her face was bright red and her eyes moistened.<br/>
「I, I don’t mind even if I die for you!」<br/>
Aria-san suddenly said something strange. I tilted my head at her.<br/>
「No, even if you told me you don’t mind dying……it’s better to not say something like that. I want Aria-san to be happ──ouch!」<br/>
<br/>
For some reason, Aria-san’s right hand snapped and I received a hard slap. I’m used to receiving unreasonable violence but, why is Aria-san doing this? While I’m thinking that, astonished voices came from inside the Jewel.<br/>
(TN: Japanese author Natsume Soseki, in his life as an English teacher, supposedly saw his students translate “I love you” word-for-word. Soseki told them that’s not Japanese (too direct) and that “the moon is beautiful” would be the appropriate translation (alone with a lady on a moonlit night, context says it all). There is absolutely no citable reference to back this up, but it is so entrenched as lore that everyone gets the reference. A contemporary of Soseki’s supposedly invented “I will die for you” as a Japanese translation for “I love you.” So today, more in the context of fiction than real life, you could find a couple exchanging “the moon is beautiful” and “I can die for you” in reply to that.)<br/>
『Aa~, it’s Lyle just as expected.』<br/>
『It’s the usual Lyle.』<br/>
『That’s the worst. Zero points.』<br/>
『……I thought that this was the case.』<br/>
『Lyle, didn’t you like books?』<br/>
『It can’t be helped just now. You should just accept that slap contently.』<br/>
Unbelievably, no one is consoling me in regards to the unreasonable violence just now.<br/>
Aria-san stood up wordlessly, walked away from me, and sat down again some distance away, resuming her night watch.<br/>
「Aria-san? Err……I apologize if I did something rude so」<br/>
When I approached her, Aria-san shifted her face away.<br/>
「It’s nothing! I know that it’s not really your bad but, right now it’s no good! That’s why I’m begging you go over there!」<br/>
I who got rejected returned to my previous spot with my shoulders dropping in dejection. I was simply saying my honest thought that the moon is beautiful and then such strange reply came……was there some kind of mistake?<br/>
The ancestors were laughing.<br/>
『You are really amazing in various aspects huh.』<br/>
『The timing was the best just now.』<br/>
『From fate to the moon is beautiful, it’s because you said that.』<br/>
『……I honestly respect you. After all you said that for yourself.』<br/>
『Me too. I think that’s amazing, Lyle.』<br/>
『I also think so but……it was rude to Aria.』<br/>
……The ancestors won’t tell me the reason. These people who won’t cooperate fully with me in some aspects, will they be gone too someday I wonder?<br/>
