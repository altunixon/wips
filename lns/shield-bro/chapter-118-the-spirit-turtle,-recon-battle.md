VS. Spirit Turtle, Recon Battle<br/>
"It’s much bigger up close." (Raphtalia)<br/>
Before my eyes, the large turtle is getting closer step by step.<br/>
There is an earthquake every time it takes a step, it is making me stagger.<br/>
"That seems to be the case." (Naofumi)<br/>
"……We should escape." (Rishia)<br/>
"I understand your feelings." (Naofumi)<br/>
It’s been about a month since the heroes came and let this out….. It is reckless to fight against an opponent that those heroes from before couldn’t beat.<br/>
…..There is a reason why I can’t leave, it can’t be helped.<br/>
Well, let’s test something.<br/>
It should be fine to withdraw immediately if it gets dangerous.<br/>
"That turtle is huge~" (Firo)<br/>
"Fueeeeeee! Itsuki-samaaa!"( Rishia)<br/>
A swarm of demon bats are coming from the first mountain-like shell.<br/>
Are these the Spirit Turtle’s Familiars?<br/>
"Meteor Shield!" (Naofumi)<br/>
Immediately the Meteor Shield I learned expands, and I fall back to Rishia.<br/>
"Highten Reaction!" (Naofumi)<br/>
The swam of Spirit Turtle’s familiars fire rays of light at us from their eyes.<br/>
Thumping sounds could be heard as the barrier is struck.<br/>
so they can use long-range attacks huh.<br/>
[TL gagingagin was the sound in the original. I changed it to thumping since that’s what i think of when i imagine a barrier blocking attacks.]<br/>
"Tei!"(Raphtalia)<br/>
"Teriyaa!"(Firo)<br/>
Raphatalia and Firo exit the barrier to attack the spirit turtle’s familiars.<br/>
"Gyiii!" (Familiars)<br/>
The familiars die off as each attack hits.<br/>
However, they are too numerous.<br/>
Since this is just reconnaissance there aren’t that many methods to go about things.<br/>
"Taha!" (Raphtalia)<br/>
"Oryaaa!" (Firo)<br/>
The familiars fall with a gasugasu, as Raphtalia and Firo cut them down.<br/>
It might be good to analyze the fight in case of something surprising.<br/>
"Are you alright?" (Naofumi)<br/>
"Yeah. But, I think it’ll be hard to bring it down." (Raphtalia)<br/>
"I see."(Naofumi)<br/>
A thud could be heard, and something falls from the Spirit Turtle.<br/>
A gorilla-like Demon with a turtle shell on its back is now coming towards us.<br/>
"Zweit Aura!" (Naofumi)[TL: In reading some comments on Yoraikun’s page I found out the author is using a lot of german in special skills. Zweit seems to mean second or tier 2 spells, and Raphtalia is capable of learning Dreifach, or third/tier 3 spells with practice. ]<br/>
I apply support magic on Raphtalia and Firo.<br/>
"Fast Guard!" (Rishia)<br/>
At the same time, Rishia applied defensive magic on me.<br/>
That was good judgement.<br/>
It seems that status and smarts aren’t related.<br/>
"Go! Yin-Yang Sword" (Raphtalia)<br/>
Raphtalia’s sword alternates between black and white glows, as it cuts through the demon.<br/>
It was split into 2 black and white spheres, they collide and destroy the demons.<br/>
Is this a certain kill sword attack that Kills two birds with one stone!?<br/>
"Critical Quick~ ̄" (Firo)<br/>
Firo becomes a blur as she quickly flies of towards the enemy and kicks.<br/>
What is that? The same attack?<br/>
That’s what I thought, but Firo’s speed doesn’t fall, and unleashes a flurry of kicks onto the demon.<br/>
"Umm you see~, its an instant version of High Quick." (Firo)<br/>
It’s an attack is easy to maintain.<br/>
That is certainly useful.<br/>
"Fue, Fast Water Shot!" (Rishia)<br/>
Rishia slips through the barrier and fires her Water Magic at the familiars.<br/>
Yup. They didn’t die.<br/>
But, they have been slowed down.<br/>
"This may be good." (Naofumi)<br/>
Well, there is a large margin between us and familiars of this degree.<br/>
The problem is the main body. Maybe, the other heroes struggled against the main body.<br/>
There is also the possibility that they are fighting within the body.<br/>
"Anyway, let’s try to fight it!" (Naofumi)<br/>
"Yes!" (Raphtalia)<br/>
"Okaay~" (Firo)<br/>
"Fueeeeee!" (Rishia)<br/>
And so, the closer we get to the spirit turtle the stronger the demons become……As we arrive in front of the spirit turtle, it recalls all of its familiars.<br/>
Of course, it’s gigantic when seen up close.<br/>
A village can be made on its face alone.<br/>
Now, what to do?<br/>
The turtle turns its gaze towards us.<br/>
"―――――――――――――――！"(Spirit Turtle)<br/>
It lets out a tremendous roar, I have to cover my ears.<br/>
This is not a friendly attitude.<br/>
I activate Meteor Shield again, to repel the familiars as I check the status of the spirit turtle.<br/>
The turtle moves its foot towards us.<br/>
"That’s dangerous!" (Naofumi)<br/>
It sends forth a powerful kick. I raise my shield to prepare for the attack at once.<br/>
With the sound of glass shattering Meteor Shield is broken, immediately after, I’m hit by the Spirit Turtle.<br/>
The shock goes through my whole body.<br/>
"gu……" (Naofumi)<br/>
I am pushed back a few steps.<br/>
"Na-Naofumi-sama?" (Raphtalia)<br/>
"Master?" (Firo)<br/>
Raphtalia and Firo manage to get in behind the shield without trouble.<br/>
Rishia had slipped under my mantle understanding the situation, letting out a ‘fueeee’.<br/>
"I-I’m fine. Here it comes again." (Naofumi)<br/>
Despite being trampled, it doesn’t seem I suffered any damage.<br/>
The cooldown for Meteor Shield has passed too.<br/>
Let’s try a new approach.<br/>
Right after that, Rain clouds gather in the sky, and the familiars surrounding us are swept away.<br/>
It’s the Queen and her guards, they’re providing cover fire.<br/>
It’s an attack that if not timed correctly, would have hit Raphtalia as well.<br/>
I think it’s an attack that can only be fired after I used my meteor shield.<br/>
"Alright! You guys, attack it for the time being!" (Naofumi)<br/>
It’s a problem that I don’t understand this monster, but it might be weaker than it looks.<br/>
"Tooooo!" (Firo)<br/>
Firo lands a powerful kick on the enormous jaw of the Spirit Turtle.<br/>
"――――――――！？" (Spirit Turtle)<br/>
The Spirit Turtle’s head was bent back.<br/>
"Waaaaa…heavy~" (Firo)<br/>
"It’s not over yet" (Raphtalia)<br/>
Raphtalia cuts across the limits of the Spirit Turtle’s neck while it’s head is bent backwards.<br/>
A crevice was made into the turtles neck, as the sound of vegetables being cut could be heard.<br/>
Blood gushed out.<br/>
However, the cut was shallow, the wound quickly regenerated, and the Turtle turned it’s angry gaze at Firo and Raphtalia.<br/>
……It’s not going to fight, huh.<br/>
Raphtalia and Firo have become immensly stronger as well.<br/>
I’m aware that i got stronger, but is that enough?<br/>
This is a hard fight to some extent, but it’s not an enemy we can’t beat<br/>
If that’s the case, those guys…. they could have won, why did they leave?<br/>
Now, it is impossible to deny the possibility that it could have been left to annoy me.<br/>
"――――――――――！"(Spirit Turtle)<br/>
A large magic formation appears before the Spirit Turtle.<br/>
…..I have a bad feeling about this.<br/>
Immediately, Raphatalia and Firo are forced to the ground.<br/>
"Gu\~uuuuu" (Firo)<br/>
"Wha, What is that….." (Raphtalia)<br/>
"What happened?" (Naofumi)<br/>
"I-I don’t know. But my body is stuck to the ground….It’s heavy" (Raphtalia)<br/>
That’s Dangerous! I don’t understand, but Raphatalia is in danger.<br/>
"Fuee?" (Rishia)<br/>
Rishia, who was under my cloak, let out a goofy sound.<br/>
This girl, doesn’t have any problems……Right?<br/>
The Barrier created by Meteor Shield was vibrating.<br/>
It’s good to see this defended against something.<br/>
I approach Raphtalia and Firo to get them into the barrier.<br/>
"Ah, It feels light again" (Firo)<br/>
They both stand up and approach.<br/>
From the looks up it, it’s safe to say this is Gravity Magic.<br/>
However, the Spirit Turtles Magic wasn’t able to break through my magic defense.<br/>
After confirming that we are not moving, the Spirit turtle tries to trample us.<br/>
You think I’d let you?!<br/>
"Shield Prison" (Naofumi)<br/>
I use Shield Prison on top of Meteor Shield.<br/>
A large clank sound can be heard, the prison breaks and the foot is blocked by the meteor shield.<br/>
……It seems to be supporting the weight of the spirit turtle for the time being……<br/>
The barrier starts creaking.<br/>
It’ll break as it is.<br/>
"We’re moving, come with me." (Naofumi)<br/>
There is no reason to continue being trampled.<br/>
"Okay!" (Raphtalia)<br/>
"Okay\~" (Firo)<br/>
"Fueee….I understand" (Rishia)<br/>
After those three understand what is going on, we escape from being trampled by the Spirit Turtle.<br/>
With a thud, the Spirit Turtle raises a cloud of dust.<br/>
Ah, it seems that Meteor Shield also prevents the dust cloud.<br/>
"We should be able to endure this for the time being" (Naofumi)<br/>
"It shouldn’t be able to pinpoint our location within this cloud of dust."(Raphtalia)<br/>
"Firo thinks we should be able to beat it right? but only if its magic is stopped."(Firo)<br/>
"Fumu….That might be a chance to attack but…."(Naofumi)<br/>
The area rumbles as familiars drop down.<br/>
Is it being overly cautious? It seems to be verifying that we were defeated.<br/>
There’s no time. What should we do……?<br/>
"Isn’t there something we can do?"(Naofumi)<br/>
"……There is. Block the next attack."(Raphtalia)<br/>
"Yeah. Firo will put everything in to the next attack"(Firo)<br/>
"Can I count on it?" (Naofumi?)<br/>
We can only attack the turtles neck. It may be possible to kill it if we attack seriously.<br/>
"I’ll leave it to you" (Naofumi)<br/>
"Yeah"(Raphtalia)<br/>
I take a stance in order for Raphtalia and Firo to deliver the their special moves.<br/>
Firo’s stance looks familiar.<br/>
She flaps her wings.<br/>
The magic power is so condensed that you can see the flow of wind from behind.<br/>
"Whenever you’re ready Raphtalia onee-chan" (Firo)<br/>
It’s faster than before! Can it now be used in actual combat?<br/>
"Wait a little longer" (Raphtalia)<br/>
Raphtalia’s tail begins to puff up.<br/>
She has condensed a suitable amount of magic also.<br/>
"My preparations are complete. Let’s go." (Raphtalia)<br/>
"Yeah!" (Firo)<br/>
Raphtalia gets on Firo’s back releasing her magical power.<br/>
"Spiral….."(Firo)<br/>
"Eight Trigrams….." (Raphtalia) [TL: 八極陣 got any other suggestions?]<br/>
Dust swirls around them, light gathers around Firo.<br/>
The light forms into an Yin Yang symbol and parts into eight.<br/>
For some reason Raphtalia’s attacks are oriental.<br/>
"Strike!" (Firo)<br/>
"Heaven’s Sword!" (Raphtalia) [TL also Fate Sword. Karma Sword]<br/>
Becoming a straight light, Raphtalia and Firo pierce through the Spirit Turtles throat.<br/>
The Spirit Turtles eyes are colored in surprise.<br/>
No…. because the head is already decapitated, it could not react.<br/>
The huge neck and body of the Spirit Turtles was pierced so beautifully, it tore off the head and sent it flying.<br/>
Fresh blood spewed from the Spirit turtles neck, and rained down.<br/>
It’s huge body falls to the ground with a thud.<br/>
"We did it" (Raphtalia)<br/>
It should be dead since the head is blown off.<br/>
That was unexpectedly easy.<br/>
It doesn’t appear to be the type of enemy we have to enter the body and seal the heart.<br/>
Cheers are heard echoing from behind.<br/>
"Fuhee……" (Rishia)<br/>
Firo touches down on ground with experience, Raphtalia does the same.<br/>
"We did it." (Raphtalia)<br/>
"Yeah, you guys did great" (Naofumi)<br/>
If we could hit high-powered moves like these, we’ll never lose.<br/>
It feels like we may have become stronger than the other Heroes.<br/>
"That’s amazing." (Rishia)<br/>
"Rishia, you work hard too, to become like that." (Naofumi)<br/>
"Fueeeeeee?! That’s impossible." (Rishia)<br/>
"It’s not impossible. You can do it!" (Naofumi)<br/>
"That’s impossible for me!" (Rishia)<br/>
Rishia thinks about tearing the head of the spirit turtle and fervently denies it.<br/>
I can’t train her spirit.<br/>
"Well then, let’s have a victory party—-" (Naofumi)<br/>
The sound of something wriggling comes from the direction of the Spirit Turtle.<br/>
Everyone notices the sound and turns their sight on to the spirit turtle.<br/>
The body of the spirit turtle stands up……The meat on its neck starts to wriggle…..<br/>
The body and head regenerate and make it seem as if nothing happen.<br/>
"Wha……" (Naofumi)<br/>
What happen?<br/>
How strong is you regenerative ability? Didn’t it just lose its head? Like a Hydra.<br/>
It seems this regeneration ability is related to the reason why those heroes of the past had to seal the heart.<br/>
"――――――――――――――――！"(Spirit Turtle) [that’s all he says, nothing]<br/>
"Argh!?" (Naofumi)<br/>
The Spirit Turtle let’s out a roar.<br/>
No…. I see something bright rise from the body through the throat.<br/>
A shiver runs up my spine.<br/>
I jump before everyone and use Meteor Shield, along with Shield Prison.<br/>
Highly concentrated lightning erupts from its mouth.<br/>
It’s like a particle gun you see in anime.<br/>
"Gu….u…." (Naofumi)<br/>
"Na-Naofumi-sama!?" (Raphtalia)<br/>
"Waa!" (Firo)<br/>
"Fueeeeee! ?" (Rishia) [she really loves making this noise.]<br/>
The cage is broken, the barrier is also penetrated, the smell of burnt skin passes through my nose.<br/>
However, with all of this pain passing through my whole body, I can’t lose consciousness.<br/>
That brief moment felt like an eternity.<br/>
"haa…haa…." (Naofumi)<br/>
I feel light-headed, I see the Spirit Turtles attack has stopped.<br/>
This is like the damage I received when using Blutopfer.<br/>
No, more than that….<br/>
I feel some places with deep burns.<br/>
"Master!?" (Firo)<br/>
"Naofumi-sama" (Raphatalia)<br/>
"Hero-sama" (Rishia)<br/>
Ku…..I try to chant recovery magic, but i can’t concentrate.<br/>
At that moment, a warm light pours around me.<br/>
My wounds heal quickly.<br/>
However, there isn’t enough time to heal completely.<br/>
"Zweit・Heal!" (Queen)<br/>
I use magic I had to learn these past few days, and I block the spirit turtle’s finishing kick.<br/>
Good, I can think clearly again.<br/>
That was probably support magic from the queen.<br/>
I was saved. Soul Eater Shield was not enough to endure that attack.<br/>
Fortunately that finishing move from the spirit turtle needs time to recharge.<br/>
When I look back, everything that I wasn’t guarding vanished, the mountain behind us is missing.<br/>
"Firo, restore your magical power." (Naofumi)<br/>
"Okay!" (Firo)<br/>
I throw Firo a magic potion I had prepared, she drinks it quickly.<br/>
"It’s bubbly~ tastes like fruit." (Firo)<br/>
"….people, call it a carbonated soft drink" (Naofumi)<br/>
Indeed, I think that mana(mp) potions taste like soda without sugar a.k.a. carbonated water, but to sum up my world’s drinks in one phrase….. as expect of this wild kid, she’s quite sharp in unusual case<br/>
At any rate, with this Firo is at maximum potential.<br/>
"It looks like attacks from the outside will be impossible. Let’s withdraw" (Naofumi)<br/>
While blocking the attacks of the Spirit Turtle, I expand Meteor Shield. I dodge his foot.<br/>
The earth shakes every time as it raises its foot again to trample us.<br/>
However, this is our chance.<br/>
"High Quick" (Firo)<br/>
Firo carries us and leaves in haste.<br/>
Really, it broke through my defense, it’ll be impossible to win with a frontal attack against a guy that can even regenerate his head.<br/>
It looks like we have no choice but to attack the heart.<br/>
Riding Firo, we withdraw from the Spirit Turtle.<br/>
<br/>
