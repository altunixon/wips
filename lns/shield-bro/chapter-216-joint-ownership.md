<br/>
Oh god.<br/>
Chapter 216: Joint Ownership<br/>
"Well, Hero of the Shield, did something happen? Yes." (Slave Dealer)<br/>
"Last we met, I had the feeling you were avoiding eye contact. Does that ring any bells?" (Naofumi)<br/>
I go over to the Slave Dealer’s place, and ask as such with my arms crossed.<br/>
I’m not saying anything was his fault, but this man is one of the many reasons Motoyasu caused me such trouble.<br/>
"Absolutely none. Yes." (Slave Dealer)<br/>
"…*Sigh*" (Naofumi)<br/>
He’s putting on a business smile.<br/>
He’s definitely faking it.<br/>
"I’m thinking of leaving my gluttonous Filo Rial in your care for a while." (Naofumi)<br/>
"T-that is…" (Slave Dealer)<br/>
"Of course, you’ll be footing the bill. I won’t let you refuse." (Naofumi)<br/>
I have some political power now, but also this person is earning a lot by selling me slaves.<br/>
There’s no way the Slave Dealer would needlessly strain our business relations.<br/>
"I understand. Yes. The fact of the matter is that I did indeed offer some Filo Rials to the Hero of the Spear." (Slave Dealer)<br/>
"So you admit it." (Naofumi)<br/>
"He barged into the tent repeating the name of the Hero of the Shield’s Filo Rial, so I offered them to him as an experiment." (Slave Dealer)<br/>
Ah, right. The Slave Dealer was trying to find out the conditions for a Filo Rial becoming a Queen.<br/>
But I had my hands full with my Glutton Firo, so I turned down his experiments.<br/>
I got my next Filo Rial much much later, and I left his care to Firo so nothing happened.<br/>
Could it be… I’m also at fault?<br/>
No no no.<br/>
I just didn’t participate in his research, and this isn’t my responsibility.<br/>
And the Slave Dealer was merely doing business. He sold his merchandise to the person looking for it.<br/>
I wonder how long ago he sold them.<br/>
The last time that I saw Motoyasu was… When Kiel and the others did their Class Up I think.<br/>
It was when I learned Portal Shield.<br/>
Back then, the Slave Dealer wasn’t there.<br/>
Perhaps I missed him and he later encountered Motoyasu.<br/>
I don’t really need to dig too deep into this.<br/>
"Regarding that matter, there is something I would like to propose." (Slave Dealer)<br/>
"What is it?" (Naofumi)<br/>
"This morning, the Hero of the Spear paid a visit, and the contract ink with your blood is all gone." (Slave dealer)<br/>
"What you say!?" (Naofumi)<br/>
Until this point, I never worried about its stock. It was something that naturally came with the slaves I bought.<br/>
Slaves aren’t free, and since testing the seal was easy, there wasn’t a risk of fake ink.<br/>
In this world, getting a slave without a seal is pretty pointless.<br/>
So Motoyasu is in possession of the Ink now.<br/>
"On the shelf where I kept the ink, I found several bags of Gold, and a sheet with a signature reminiscent of a Spear and a Filo Rial." (Slave Dealer)<br/>
D-damn! When I had Firo persuade him, I never had her tell him that crime was wrong.<br/>
What Firo told him was to be kind and honest.<br/>
Because of that, he left money. But we never told him stealing was bad.<br/>
I thought that that was included in being honest, but I guess the term literally means simply being fair in one’s actions.<br/>
So Motoyasu raises his Filo Rials honestly, and leaves them under my providence.<br/>
I don’t know how he thinks, but in his mind, perhaps that is Honesty.<br/>
"Damn!" (Naofumi)<br/>
I hastily open up the monster management Window.<br/>
… The amount of names I don’t know has exponentially increased!<br/>
That idiot! He used my ink to contract his Filo Rials.<br/>
"I’ve heard of joint ownership of slaves and monsters… This is probably…" (Slave Dealer)<br/>
I forgot to tell him not to take annoying action on his own.<br/>
If I don’t do anything about him, then Filo Rial Queens will continue to be mass produced.<br/>
He received some eggs from the Queen, and got more from this Merchant.<br/>
I need to get back to the village quickly!<br/>
"The ownership rights can be annulled by you yourself so there shouldn’t be a problem. The Hero of the Spear said he was going to the Hero of the Shield’s place." (Slave Dealer)<br/>
… The Queen said that as well. What does he plan on doing there?<br/>
Even taking an army of Filo Rials with him…<br/>
This is serious. I need some drastic countermeasures.<br/>
"Got it. I’m going back to my village! ‘Cya!" (Naofumi)<br/>
"What should I should I do about finding you slaves? Yes." (Slave Dealer)<br/>
"Please continue as before." (Naofumi)<br/>
"I understand. Yes." (Slave Dealer)<br/>
I care not for that at the moment. I run out of the tent and summon a portal.<br/>
Ah, I forgot. The Queen said it seemed like Motoyasu’s followers had Class Upped.<br/>
I return to the village and quickly scan the surroundings.<br/>
Good. Motoyasu isn’t here yet.<br/>
I need to prepare for when he gets here.<br/>
Or else…<br/>
Now that I think about it, the one who will be doing the work will be Motoyasu. I have no part in it.<br/>
Perhaps he opted for joint ownership to get my status boosts.<br/>
If he builds up forces, he may oppose me but I don’t think that Firoholic will do such a thing.<br/>
No. If he takes action on his own I’ll be troubled, but as long as I get Firo to tell him when he gets here… it should be fine!<br/>
"Hey, Naofumi. Do you know what’s going on?" (Ren)<br/>
"Hm?" (Naofumi)<br/>
Before I realized it, Ren was in front of me.<br/>
"What is it?" (Naofumi)<br/>
"I don’t know. There seems to be something going on outside the village. I can’t leave, though." (Ren)<br/>
"Outside?" (Naofumi)<br/>
"Yeah. I can only see from afar, but… Isn’t that Motoyasu?" (Ren)<br/>
What?<br/>
It suddenly feels like my blood temperature has dropped..<br/>
Ren, and Female Knight both stare towards the outskirts of the village… Where we built the Firo Rial Stable.<br/>
The slaves seem to be gathered there.<br/>
I timidly approach the area.<br/>
"Ah, Niichan- wow! Your clothes are amazing!" (Kiel)<br/>
Kiel looks at me, and jumps back at the sight of my clothes.<br/>
I don’t think I’ve worn my Barbarian Armor since I first established the village.<br/>
For me, this clothing is normal, though.<br/>
"Don’t mind it." (Naofumi)<br/>
"No… I can’t. Niichan, are you in to that sort of clothing?" (Kiel)<br/>
"I don’t know whether I like or hate it, but it’s abilities are high, and it was made by someone who treats me well." (Naofumi)<br/>
"Is that so?" (Kiel)<br/>
I’d like to move on from this topic already.<br/>
What is happening in the Filo Rial stable!<br/>
"Naofumi-sama." (Atlas)<br/>
"I just got back. What’s happening?" (Naofumi)<br/>
"I think it was right after Niichan left. Or perhaps before that? It seems there were intruders in the stable." (Kiel)<br/>
"I-I see." (Naofumi)<br/>
"We were deliberating how to drive them out, but because Niichan wasn’t here, we didn’t want to take action yet…" (Kiel)<br/>
"Yes, Sadina-san isn’t here either, and when we sent someone to ask Melty-chan in the neighboring village, we got a report saying Firo didn’t want to come here no matter what." (Atlas)<br/>
The bad feeling in my chest begins to encompass more parts of my body.<br/>
Motoyasu is definitely here.<br/>
"What should we do?" (Atlas)<br/>
"L-let me go confirm the situation there." (Naofumi)<br/>
Perhaps I can talk to him.<br/>
I carefully walk up to the Filo Rial stable and put my hand on the large door.<br/>
I can hear some noises coming from the inside.<br/>
Firo should only have one follower right now. I did plan on getting more in the future though.<br/>
What is this? My blood goes cold again.<br/>
Every single instinct in my body is telling me not to open this door.<br/>
But putting this problem off won’t solve anything.<br/>
I muster up my courage and swing the door open.<br/>
"Wha…!?" (Naofumi)<br/>
The inside of the building was pitch black.<br/>
No… that’s wrong. There are too many Filo Rials, and all outside light is blocked.<br/>
"Ah, the scent of Filo Rials… Sniff. Sniff." (Motoyasu)<br/>
Right before my eyes, Motoyasu was embracing a Filo Rial Queen, and taking in her scent.<br/>
Surrounding him is a large flock of Queens.<br/>
I hear the sounds of feathers ruffling as all heads turn to face me.<br/>
I’m surrounded by eyes.<br/>
""Who is it?"" (Filo Rials)<br/>
"Ah, I think he was the Master Moto-kun was talking about." (Filo Rial)<br/>
"Right. His eyes look mean, but he somehow looks nice." (Filo Rial)<br/>
"Yeah. That must be it." (Filo Rial)<br/>
"I get you man. Somehow looking at him makes me feel motivated." (Filo Rial)<br/>
"Right, right. The feeling he gives of is different than Motopi." (Filo Rial)<br/>
Goosebumps break out all over my body.<br/>
""Master! Let’s play!"" (Filo Rials)<br/>
Bang!<br/>
I immediately slam the door and run.<br/>
A few seconds later the door opens once more. I look back and am confronted with the terrifying sight of a flock of Filo Rials gaining on me.<br/>
"MOTOYASUUUUU! GET OUTTTTT!" (Naofumi)<br/>
My heartless cry echoes through the village.<br/>
By the way, my salvation came in the form of Firo, who mustered up her courage and came to check the situation out. I now owe her one.<br/>
I won’t say what sort of things happened to me until she came to my aid.<br/>
<br/>
