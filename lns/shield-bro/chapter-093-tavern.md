<br/>
I was laughing the whole chapter.<br/>
Bar<br/>
Evening that day.<br/>
Accompanying an ill-humoured Raphtalia, we entered a bar on the island for a change of mood.<br/>
At first Raphtalia had an unhappy expression, but after a few minutes it was replaced with a smile.<br/>
The bar was overflowing with vigor and noisy adventurers clamoring over each other.<br/>
Some were talking about hunting grounds to raise levels, some were talking about accessories purchased that increase experience gained.<br/>
That fraud trader is doing quite well.<br/>
By the way, any bar fees for the heroes are paid by the queen.<br/>
Such a place truly feels like a different world<br/>
Firo:"Ah! This place seems fun!"<br/>
Since Firo is a bird. Did she take an interest in the music being played here?<br/>
Naofumi:"Go for it. Don’t cause any trouble though."<br/>
Firo:"Un!"<br/>
Firo runs off with a pitter-patter and starts dancing to the music.<br/>
As we sat down on a counter seat, our liquor was provided.<br/>
I drank lightly.<br/>
U-…….n. Even after coming to a different world, the taste of alcohol doesn’t change.<br/>
Feels like juice.<br/>
Raphtalia:"This is alcohol……"<br/>
Naofumi:"Well, it should be fine for you Raphtalia, since your body is that of an adults."<br/>
Raphtalia:"Okay!"<br/>
Somehow, the feeling of Raphtalia putting her mouth gingerly on the cup is one of a child drinking alcohol for the first time.<br/>
Raphtalia:"……It’s slightly bitter."<br/>
Naofumi:"Yeah, I guess."<br/>
Though for me it still feels like juice and water.<br/>
I have never gotten drunk.<br/>
Raphtalia:"What does Naofumi-sama think of drinking alcohol?"<br/>
Naofumi:"Nothing particularly special……I don’t have a hobby of it. I just drink due to social situations."<br/>
Raphtalia:"So that’s how it is."<br/>
Naofumi:"There are people in my world who don’t drink it at all, it should be the same in this one."<br/>
Ren and Itsuki are minors, but in this different world, they are probably drinking.<br/>
Ah…… I discover Itsuki participating in a feast outside the bar.<br/>
I thought you were a minor.<br/>
Oh well, it’s a different world after all. There shouldn’t be any laws to punish him.<br/>
The possibility of Ren drinking is also quite high.<br/>
Naofumi:"It might be good to measure how much you can drink."<br/>
Raphtalia:"Right……"<br/>
Raphtalia puts the cup to her mouth and gulps down all the alcohol.<br/>
Naofumi:"How are you feeling?"<br/>
Raphtalia:"Let’s see."<br/>
I recall a banquet in my former world.<br/>
There wasn’t a sense of girls particularly avoiding alcohol.<br/>
Well, Raphtalia has been accumulating a lot of stress recently, I wonder if this would be good for her.<br/>
Since alcohol’s original purpose since the primitive ages was to relieve day-to-day fatigue.<br/>
She’s a patient one after all. I’m quite interested in her real thoughts.<br/>
Naofumi:"Hey, don’t worry and drink."<br/>
Raphtalia:"Okay."<br/>
While recommending Raphtalia to drink, the bard’s singing could be heard quite clearly.<br/>
When I look, Firo’s demon form is singing along with the bard’s performance.<br/>
At first the bard was surprised, but after hearing Firo’s unexpectedly good singing, tension started to heat up.<br/>
It’s fine if they are enjoying it……<br/>
Hm? It seems Motoyasu also notices Firo singing.<br/>
Leave it alone. Even you wouldn’t pounce on her demon form.<br/>
Motoyasu:"Sing in your angel appearance, Firo-chan~!<br/>
Firo:"No!"<br/>
……Alright. Everything seems fine.<br/>
After thirty minutes.<br/>
Raphtalia:"Can we please raise our levels with Naofumi-sama today?<br/>
After drinking fifteen cups of alcohol, Raphtalia speaks her thoughts to me.<br/>
The line of being drunk is crossed ambiguously.<br/>
Except for her slightly red cheeks, she appears somewhat sober still.<br/>
The alcohol seems considerably strong.<br/>
Though it’s nice for keeping company, it would be troublesome for the effects to appear tomorrow……<br/>
The boss of the bar couldn’t hide his surprise at how heavy of a drinker Raphtalia is.<br/>
Apparently, the demi-humans aren’t especially resistant to alcohol.<br/>
However…… The grape-like fruits put on the counter are very delicious.<br/>
The impression they give me are like condensed grapes, but also have a very refreshing after taste. Yet, after eating one…… My hand inadvertently extends for another.<br/>
No Name:"And that’s game–!"<br/>
A guy that lost arm wrestling fell down over here.<br/>
Raphtalia:"Hey! We are talking here, please stop disturbing us."<br/>
Raphtalia declares while in a bad mood.<br/>
Usually she wouldn’t say such things. Is it the effects of alcohol?<br/>
Her stress was accumulating quite a lot. The cause may not be just Motoyasu and Ren.<br/>
Thinking back, there was almost no rest while peddling, fighting the wave, and living as fugitives.<br/>
Venting may be necessary.<br/>
No Name:"Ha! Don’t complain until you win in an arm-wrestle."<br/>
Raphtalia:"Is that so?……Fine. I’ll be your opponent."<br/>
Raphtalia rolls back her sleeve and declares her participation in the arm-wrestling match.<br/>
Well……It should be fine. It would be troublesome if some-one got hurt though.<br/>
But……These delicious grapes.<br/>
Boss:"Umm……"<br/>
The boss of the bar anxiously talks to me.<br/>
Naofumi:"Hm?"<br/>
Boss:"Is this going to be alright?"<br/>
Naofumi:"Well, there shouldn’t be a problem."<br/>
Boss:"No, that’s not what I mean……"<br/>
Naofumi:"Yes?"<br/>
For some reason the boss of the bar’s expression is pale.<br/>
Why is he pale?<br/>
No name:"Alcohol! Bring more alcohol!"<br/>
And with a very loud voice, a man brings a big barrel of grape-like fruits from the corner of the tavern and stirs it.<br/>
Is this the secret ingredient? Oh well, the fruits are delicious so it’s fine.<br/>
The bar continues to bustle with such a feeling.<br/>
As for Raphtalia’s arm-wrestling match, she insta-killed her opponent.<br/>
Who the hell can defeat her in arm wrestling?! And, there’s yelling.<br/>
Firo is singing enthusiastically with the bard.<br/>
It seems this change of pace was good.<br/>
While thinking that, I throw more grape-like fruits into my mouth.<br/>
No Name:"Ah, What are you doing!<br/>
A man points at me and yells loudly.<br/>
The whole bar falls silent in an instant.<br/>
No Name:"You, eating the Rukoru Fruit directly, do you want to die!?"<br/>
Naofumi:"Haa? Rukoru Fruit?"<br/>
Since there was another bunch in the vicinity I threw more into my mouth.<br/>
Immediately after, the surroundings grew noisy.<br/>
Is there something strange?<br/>
Raphtalia:"Na-Naofumi-sama. What did you do?"<br/>
It seems Raphtalia has awoke from her drunken state due to the commotion.<br/>
Naofumi:"Who knows? I don’t understand why these guys are making a commotion."<br/>
This taste could become a habit. It might even be my favourite.<br/>
Let’s have another.<br/>
I throw more into my mouth.<br/>
No Name:"Ah, You’re still eating more!?"<br/>
For some reason, the whole bar’s attention is focused on me.<br/>
Why on earth are you guys so surprised?<br/>
Another one is thrown in.<br/>
Motoyasu:"What’s wrong?"<br/>
Motoyasu sees what happens and approaches me.<br/>
Naofumi:"I don’t know, these unpleasant guys are complaining about me eating this fruit."<br/>
Motoyasu:"Interesting……That fruit must be very expensive right?"<br/>
Naofumi:"Is that so? My bad. I’ll pay later, so endure it for now."<br/>
Shadow will pay the money if I ask. Since the queen is on my side. I can eat in peace.<br/>
Boss:"Uhh……They are indeed expensive……but that’s not the problem……"<br/>
The boss of the tavern answers badly.<br/>
What is it?<br/>
Boss:"Uhh……Err, The Rukoru Fruit can only be drunk after mixing it with a big barrel of water. When you just eat such a thing……"<br/>
Naofumi:"Haa? What are you saying? I won’t be fooled easily."<br/>
Boss:"No……The truth is……"<br/>
Motoyasu:"Naofumi not getting drunk. Such a lie won’t work on me."<br/>
While saying that Motoyasu picks up a Rukoru fruit and throws it in his mouth.<br/>
Motoyasu:"Oh……What a rich taste, This is delicious–"<br/>
Right after Motoyasu said so, he fell forward and collapsed.<br/>
A loud crash resounded throughout the room.<br/>
Haha! This guy’s eyes turned all white.<br/>
Speaking of which, is this fruit dangerous?<br/>
No name:"B-Big trouble! The Hero of the Spear-sama ate a Rukoru Fruit and collapsed!"<br/>
No name:"Quickly make him vomit it out!"<br/>
No name:"Right!"<br/>
The bar was thrown into another commotion and Motoyasu was carried off.<br/>
Seriously……Isn’t the fun atmosphere completely ruined now?<br/>
However, this thing seems to be highly condensed alcohol.<br/>
Naofumi:"Raphtalia, you want to eat one?"<br/>
Raphtalia:"No……"<br/>
Naofumi:"Then, does Firo want one?"<br/>
Firo stopped singing, came to me, and brought the fruit close to her mouth.<br/>
Suddenly, Firo snapped her mouth shut and took her distance from me.<br/>
Firo:"No!"<br/>
Naofumi:"You not being a glutton sure is rare."<br/>
Firo:"That fruit, It’s disgusting!"<br/>
Hmm……For some reason her reaction is very bad.<br/>
I didn’t think Firo could possibly refuse.<br/>
No Name:"It’s an Uwabamiiiiiiiiiiii!"<br/>
(Tl note: With the power of Rikai-kun and context, I figured out Uwabami ウワバミ means heavy drinker. Google gave me an elephant inside a snake.)<br/>
No Name:"It’s a monster!"<br/>
No Name:"Even the god of alcohol would run away with his tail between his legs—-!"<br/>
The surrounding dissolves into chaos.<br/>
This fruit……Is there some kind of joke?<br/>
I won’t be fooled.<br/>
Naofumi:"I’m sorry for causing a disturbance. Shall we return to the hotel?"<br/>
Raphtalia:"O-Okay."<br/>
As we are about to leave the bar that was still in an uproar.<br/>
Naofumi:"Oh right, the gold will be paid later, a messenger from the Hero of the Shield will pay it, I think."<br/>
While saying that to the boss of the tavern, we left the bar and headed back to the hotel to sleep.<br/>
Later, there was an exaggerated rumor going around the island……It was about the Hero of the Shield being a monster in the shape of a person.<br/>
Is the power of the Three Heroes Church still alive?<br/>
<br/>
