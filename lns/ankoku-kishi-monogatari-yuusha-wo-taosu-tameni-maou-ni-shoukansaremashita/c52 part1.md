Chapter 52.1 : Library of Heaven<br/>
◆???<br/>
In the beginning, the world was in chaos.<br/>
Then the God of Genesis descended. HE came into this chaotic world from the spirit world, and created sea, earth, and sky from the primordial chaos. Next, HE created giants and dragons, the primordial races, and the spirits of the four elements. Earth, Water, Wind, and Fire.<br/>
And finally, HE created two pillars for his creations.<br/>
They are the God of Light, Orgis, the owner of Great Wings and Goddess of Darkness, Nargol, the owner of Great Horn. After the HE created the two pillars, The God of Genesis left for another world, entrusting the newly created world to the two. Since Nargol was the more powerful of the pair, she became the ruler of this particular world and Orgis became her second-in-command.<br/>
They ruled the world together. And, with time, they became a couple. From their union, Nargol gave birth to many gods and created many creatures for them. As a result, the world was filled to brims with a lot of creatures.<br/>
But, Orgis was dissatisfied. Because Nargol was more powerful than him, Orgis had always been dominated by her. Furthermore, she was also brutal, killing her own children that had displeased her.<br/>

<br/>
For this reason, Orgis always feared Nargol. He was also displeased with the children who were born between them. In his opinion, anyone would be displeased with the fact that their children were born ugly, and that was exactly how most of the children between him and Nargol were born as.<br/>
And Orgis, thinking that the reason for their children’s ugly appearance was because of Nargol’s own ugly appearance, summoned another Goddess from the spirit world. And, his summon got answered by a beautiful Goddess named Mina.<br/>
So, behind Nargol’s back, Orgis began his sordid affairs with Mina. He began to make love with her and they gave birth to many other Gods.<br/>
Gods such as Oudith the Bright, Trident the Strong, Heibos the Skilled. Goddesses such as Melfina the Wise, Faeria the Noble, and Ishtia the Beauty, etc, etc. And, to Orgis’s delight, all of these new gods he fathered were beautiful. Unlike the ones he fathered with Nargol. Thus, in order to protect their childrens, Orgis made the angel race using part of his and Mina’s body.<br/>
But, Nargol eventually found out about Orgis’s adultery act. And her fury when she discovered that and Mina’s existence turned her into the God of Destruction. She rushed in and slaughtered Mina.<br/>
Orgis was grieved by Mina’s death. But, her death wasn’t the end. Nargol wasn’t satisfied with that. So she created the giants race that thrive on destruction and ordered them to kill Mina’s children. But Orgis had enough and decided to fight against Nargol. All for the sake of protecting his and Mina’s children.<br/>
In retaliation, Nargol ordered her children to help her slaughter Mina’s children. But, some of her children were reluctant to do that. So, eventually, her children were divided into two factions. Those who refused to follow her order and chose to be on the neutral side, and those who abide Nargol’s order to the letter.<br/>
Those who chose to follow their mother were known as 「Nargolian」. Amongst the Nagolians, the vanguards assembled to exterminate Mina’s children were Felion The Wicked Beast, Zarxis The Death God, and Diadona The Serpent Queen. And, against them, Mina’s children were helpless as they fell one by one.<br/>
Seeing the situation turning worse, Orgis requested the cooperation of the neutral party who chose not to obey their mother. He requested them to protect Mina’s children. At that, the Gods who formed the neutral party made their appearance in the struggle.<br/>
They were Casa, the owner of thousands wings and precognition; Volgas, one-eyes giant god who excelled at craftsmanship and smithing; and Sagittarius of four-footed who was a martial arts master. Casa taught magic to Mina’s children, while Sagittarius taught them martial arts. Finally, Volgas taught Heibos his craftsmanship and smithing arts. With Oudith as their leader, Mina’s children began to fight back against the Nargolians.<br/>
Nevertheless, even with them being able to fight back, there were only two out of many surviving children who could fight on par against the most powerful Nargolians. Oudith and Trident.<br/>
At this rate, it’s only a matter of time before all Mina’s children got slaughtered. Orgis, who realized that, became their shield in the fight against Nargolian. Nargolians couldn’t defeat Orgis, their father. Thus, with his protection, Mina’s children were shielded.<br/>

Nargol finally snapped when she saw Orgis, her own husband, protecting Mina’s children. So, in rage, she murdered Orgis. By the time her sanity returned, the only thing she saw was her husband’s corpse. She was saddened and heartbroken when she saw that she ended up murdering her own husband. However, it didn’t last for long as she prepared to create a God to replace Orgis. She absorbed Orgis’s corpse into her own body, and gave birth to her last child. One who was more powerful than her.<br/>
And his name was Demon King Modes, her beloved, strongest, and last son.<br/>
Together with Nargolians and Modes, Nargol decided to destroy this world and created it anew. However, to begin that plan, every single one of Mina’s children had to die. Thus, Nargolians led by Modes began their slaughter.<br/>
Mina’s children were already in a precarious state. But then, Melfina, the Wise, made her move. Using her beauty, Melfina seduced Modes and tried to win him as their allies. Seduced, Modes had a change of heart and began to pursue the beautiful Goddess.<br/>
But when Nargol became aware of Melfina’s plan, she went and slaughtered Melfina in anger. Even so, on the verge of completely vanishing from this world, Melfina still managed to give birth to twins. Exquisite Goddess Rena and Gorgeous God Alphos. [ED: God, just make the story title as: Love, Lust Bring Forth Destruction. And, is the author obsessed with beauty or what?]<br/>
When Modes realized that his mother had killed Melfina, he got enraged and revolted against her. He decided to cooperate with Oudith, fighting against Nargolians and Nargol, his very own mother. It was at the moment when Nargol, together with her children, was betrayed by her own Most Beloved Son, whose power exceeded her own, and also the turning point of the battle.<br/>
Modes killed Death God Zarxis, sealed Wicked Beast Ferion, and pushed Serpent Queen Diadona to retreat due to fear. Meanwhile, the other Nargolians were either defeated, escaped, or surrendered to Modes. And finally, Nargol was defeated in the Northern Land by Modes and Oudith. The land where Nargol breathed her last was then called「Land of Nargol」.<br/>
The victorious side, Oudith and the others then hailed themselves as the rulers of this world. They built their palaces on the top of the highest mountains of this world and from then on were known as 「Gods of Elios」.<br/>
Oudith stood at the top of the Gods of Elios and proclaimed himself as the King of the Gods and taking Faeria as his wife. With this, the world knew peace at last.[TLEDPR : INCEST!!!]<br/>
But, another problem soon arose.<br/>

What were Nargol’s children, that comprised the neutral party, to do? Here, the opinions of the Gods and Goddesses of Elios were divided.<br/>
Modes and Volgas insisted that they had to join Elios. However, a multitude of Goddesses were opposed to it. Ishita and Rena were some of the most vocal about it. The reason?<br/>
It was because Ishtia was courted by the ugly Sea God, Draugon, and Rena herself was courted by the Violent Deity, Labrys. It was the same case with the other Goddesses. They were courted by the Gods who descended from Nargol, who was notoriously ugly. Hence their vehement opposition towards the neutral Gods.<br/>
Correspondingly, the Gods of Elios couldn’t get along with the neutral Gods. The ramification of these actions was the widening crack between the Gods who inherited Nargol’s blood and the Gods who inherited Mina’s blood.<br/>
Nevertheless, despite that, the world was still peaceful.<br/>
Until a certain day.<br/>
Faeria was displeased with the fact that the world was overflowing with the races that Nargol created. She felt that the world should be filled with races that Mina’s children created. However, there was one problem with that thought. None of them knew how to create a new race. Thus, Faeria went to Heibos to consult him on this matter.<br/>
Unfortunately, Heibos told her that he had no knowledge on how to create a new race. Faeria didn’t give up though as she asked Heibos to create a magic tool that could give birth to a new race.<br/>
Troubled by her request, Heibos headed to Modes to ask for his cooperation, and since he was given the ability to create life by his mother, Modes decided to cooperate. However, due to Faeria’s hatred for Modes and all Gods who had Nargol’s blood in them, they chose to keep their cooperation secret.<br/>
And, after some efforts, their collaboration resulted in the creation of the Kettle of Life. Through this, Mina’s children should be able to create living beings. However, this alone wasn’t enough. They also needed other ingredients in order to create life, namely, body parts of the God involved and various exotic ingredients in large amounts. Not to be forgotten, a huge amount of mana needed to be sent into the kettle as well.<br/>
To test that the magic tool actually worked, Heibos decided to use Mina’s, his mother’s, corpse, as the God involved with the new creation and the numerous ingredients provided by Modes. So they used the kettle to make the beautiful demon race.<br/>
Heibos saw the creation of the demon race and was satisfied that it worked. He then gave the kettle to Faeria. Delighted, Faeria gathered her brethrens and Oudith and together, they created the various new races.<br/>
The elven race who could communicate with the spirits.<br/>

The Dwarf race who excelled in craftsmanship.<br/>
And then, the all-purpose human race.<br/>
Gods of Elios were incredibly delighted with the birth of the human race. Thus, they kept increasing the number of the newest race, the human race and sent them to the world, increasing their number exponentially.<br/>
But another problem occured. When the number of new races increased, the competition for living space and resources with the older races started to escalate.<br/>
Seeing that, Faeria was enraged and dispatched the God of War, Thors, who was born to her and Oudith, to attack those older races. But, her action sparked another conflict. This time between Elios and the former neutral Gods who were related to the races that were attacked.<br/>
Faeria, who was discontent with them since the beginning of Elios, relabeled the former neutral Gods, who fought back against her actions, to Evil Gods. And since the majority of the Gods descended from Mina, from Rena to Thors, had the same opinion with Faeria, the fight started again in earnest.<br/>
On the opposing side were the Gods who descended from Nargol, and they were led by Volgas and Modes. Disgruntled, Faeria worked together with Rena to exclude Volgas and Modes, the center of their opposition. Besides, the Goddesses had always hated Volgas and Modes from the very beginning because they were ugly. So, all Goddesses cooperate with Faeria and Rena to remove Volgas and Modes.<br/>
First, they banished Modes. The one who did that was Rena. After all, Modes couldn’t go against Melfina’s daughter, the Goddess he loved, daughter. So, he left to the Northern Land, the Land of Nargol, alongside the demon race he created. [ED: THE HECK?! That’s your father. Oh god, what a bitch. Just because of his face?!] [TL : Erm No, Modes isn’t Rena’s father]<br/>
After Modes, Volgas’s turn came. Faeria tried to exile Volgas in the same way Modes was banished, but she was powerless against Volgas’s just and fair nature. She couldn’t banish him. At that point, an incident occured. The God of War, Thors, being young, short-sighted, and impulsive, went and murdered Volgas.<br/>
His action left the Gods of Elios astonished. They had never thought that he’d go as far as murder just to get rid of Volgas who they admitedly thought of as a hindrance. However, that incident made the other Gods, who descended from Nargol, shudder, so they left Elios.<br/>
Heibos, who had always regarded Volgas as his master, secluded himself and never showed himself in Elios again. This action had a snowball effect. Starting with Trident, it moved some of Mina’s children, who felt a debt of gratitude toward Volgas, to leave one after another. And the repercussions of it left Elios weakened.<br/>
Oudith was also grieving because of Volgas’ death. To him, Volgas was the benefactor who had helped them in their fight against Nargol. As such, he definitely couldn’t forgive anyone who killed Volgas. However, it was Thors who did it. And Oudith wouldn’t punish Thors, his own child.<br/>

<br/>
Oudith’s torn feelings caused Elios to be weakened even further due to the lack of punishment and law enforcement. As such, they didn’t have the time to think about the fight against the Evil Gods. Thus, the battle against the Evil Gods had never happened, keeping the world’s peace intact.<br/>
