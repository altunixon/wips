<br/>
"Takki-dono, Sasaki-dono, Lucy-dono, there’s something I want to talk about." (Fujiwara)<br/>
At the inn’s cafeteria, when we were having breakfast, Fuji-yan spoke with a serious expression.<br/>
"Actually…it has turned out that I will be marrying both Chris-dono and Nina-dono." (Fujiwara)<br/>
"""Eh?"""<br/>
Wait, what are you saying?<br/>
No, I did feel it.<br/>
At the right of Fuji-yan, there’s Nina-san snuggled up to him, and at the other side, Chris-san is sticking to him.<br/>
Also, there’s no thorny atmosphere like before. They acted as if they were completely fine with each other.<br/>
Didn’t it change too much compared to yesterday?, is what I thought, but getting along is better than not getting along, so I didn’t say anything.<br/>
"U-Uhm, meaning that Fujiwara-kun will be marrying the two…?" (Aya)<br/>
Sa-san asks this question with an apprehensive look.<br/>
"Yeah…this country does accept polygamy after all." (Fujiwara)<br/>
Fuji-yan looked like he found it hard to answer that.<br/>
Even though he isn’t doing anything bad.<br/>
"I see…" (Aya)<br/>
Sa-san didn’t say anymore after that.<br/>
"Uhm, congratulations…Fujiyan-san, Nina-san…" (Lucy)<br/>
Lucy is the type to clearly say things, but she was having difficulty speaking here.<br/>
"Yes!" (Nina)<br/>
Compared to that, Nina-san is all smiles.<br/>
Well, it is great that they are happy.<br/>
And I…<br/>
(Eh? He said yesterday at the bar that a harem is a reckless dream, but it would be nice if it were to come true one day, and yet, it was granted the very next day? Did you betray me?) (Makoto)<br/>
I was flustered. Well, it is not like he betrayed me or anything though.<br/>
Maybe Fuji-yan heard my mind, his face stiffened.<br/>
"I wish the three of you happiness." (Makoto)<br/>
I could only give a safe response.<br/>
◇◇<br/>
Fuji-yan and the others said that they will be telling the work related people about their marriage, and left.<br/>
Lucy, Sa-san, and I were going to do what we couldn’t do yesterday; explore Horun.<br/>
"Wow, that was a surprise! To think he would marry the two of them!" (Lucy)<br/>
Lucy flailed her arms around and expressed her surprise.<br/>
Maybe it isn’t that rare of a story for Lucy who was raised in this world.<br/>
"Elves normally only have one husband and one wife though…" (Lucy)<br/>
Looks like that’s not the case.<br/>
Elves probably have the same marriage standards as us in Japan.<br/>
"I don’t know… I can’t imagine two wives." (Aya)<br/>
Sa-san, who was born and raised in Japan, tilted her head.<br/>
"Yeah. But Sakurai-kun apparently has a whole lot of wife candidates, you know." (Makoto)<br/>
This is something I heard from Fuji-yan.<br/>
To make a descendant with Sakurai-kun who has the Light Hero Skill like that of the Saviour Abel is apparently a national project, and he has a massive amount of proposals.<br/>
Yokoyama-san seems to be one of those, is what I said, and Sa-san went ‘Uhe’, and made a disgusted expression.<br/>
"Do you want a whole lot of wives too, Makoto?" (Lucy)<br/>
Lucy asks me in a low voice.<br/>
"N-No, I am not interested in that." (Makoto)<br/>
"Really~?" (Aya)<br/>
Sa-san peeks at my face.<br/>
[Clear Mind] 99%.<br/>
"I am currently concentrating on granting the wish of the Goddess." (Makoto)<br/>
Nailed it.<br/>
Appealing that I am a man serious about my job. I managed to change the topic without lowering their affection.<br/>
""…""<br/>
Sa-san and Lucy had unamused faces.<br/>
E-Eh?<br/>
(Why are you talking about a different woman in this situation…?) (Noah)<br/>
Eeh? Was that no good?<br/>
(Study about the heart of a woman.) (Noah)<br/>
There was nothing written about this in the strategy books of my games…<br/>
"Hey, Aya, doesn’t that clothing store have cute clothes?" (Lucy)<br/>
"It really does! Let’s look, let’s look!" (Aya)<br/>
The girls went their way.<br/>
…Guess I will be carrying the bags.<br/>
◇◇<br/>
"Hey there, girls! Want to come watch the circus?" <br/>
After accompanying Lucy and Sa-san in their shopping for a while, we finished lunch, and were wandering around.<br/>
We were taking a break at a bench close to the plaza that has the big tent, and there, a man with a flashy outfit and makeup calling for customers spoke to us.<br/>
How to say it, he looks like a clown.<br/>
So there’s clowns in Isekais too, huh.<br/>
"Hmm, what should we do, Makoto?" (Lucy)<br/>
"Want to watch, Takatsuki-kun?" (Aya)<br/>
Kuh, they asked before me.<br/>
So I have to decide?<br/>
I am the type that leaves these kinds of things to others though.<br/>
"Hey there, brother! Is this your first time in the Water Country? The Circus Trope of Monster Tamers is the number one circus trope of the continent. It is perfect as a story to talk about. One person is 1,500G, but if it is 3 people, how about 4,000G?" <br/>
The customer-bringer clown thinks I am a country bumpkin, huh. He speaks as if saying ‘never seen it before, right?’.<br/>
I actually am from the countryside though.<br/>
I lived in the city in Japan though, okay?! <br/>
While thinking about what I am even trying to prove here, we ended up going.<br/>
◇◇<br/>
The inside of the tent is dim, and at the center, there’s a round stage with spotlights illuminating it. <br/>
There were a lot of tables and seats surrounding it, and the audience was there drinking and enjoying.<br/>
It is a bit different from the circuses of Japan.<br/>
We sat at a table closeby and ordered drinks.<br/>
"Hey, that’s a Griffon, isn’t it?" (Lucy)<br/>
What Lucy pointed at was a Griffon that was smaller than the one we fought before, jumping through a ring of fire.<br/>
It seems to be getting decently heated up.<br/>
"The monsters seem to be beaten up." (Aya)<br/>
Just as Sa-san said, the Griffon is wearing a flashy costume, but its feathers and fur were worn-out.<br/>
"That’s…an elf?" <br/>
Next, a beautiful lady of pointed ears appeared with a raunchy outfit.<br/>
She has what seems to be a collar.<br/>
"Her hair is black, so it must be a half-elf…just like me." (Lucy)<br/>
Lucy told us.<br/>
Does it not bother her?<br/>
No, she seems to be.<br/>
She isn’t saying anything, but her face is a bit grim.<br/>
We were watching for a while, but it was a show with a Mid Class monster, a demi-human elf, and a show where a beastkin woman with a skimpy outfit danced.<br/>
Monsters would perform tricks, or have them fight each other.<br/>
In other words, a world of violence, blood, and eros.<br/>
I couldn’t bring myself to like it, but the surroundings were pretty excited.<br/>
Do the city people wish for stimulus?<br/>
I suddenly remember the sweet cigar scent I smelled yesterday at the bar.<br/>
Weed, was it? A narcotic drug leaf.<br/>
…Let’s not stay for long.<br/>
We left the circus tent after 1 hour.<br/>
"Oh, already leaving?" <br/>
The clown of before was still there.<br/>
"Yeah, we enjoyed plenty enough", is what I answer with.<br/>
"I see, that’s great. We have an even bigger event planned, so do come by!" <br/>
The clown continued his cheerful business talk.<br/>
I simply answered with a ‘if I have time, I will’.<br/>
"I am good. Having all the women showing up being demi-humans or beastkin is a bit…" (Lucy)<br/>
"Yeah, the monsters were a bit pitiful." (Aya)<br/>
It wasn’t popular with the girls.<br/>
The points they were bothered with differed.<br/>
Me? I would have preferred if the show were only about women. <br/>
◇◇<br/>
Night is training time.<br/>
Is what I would like to say, but this place has close to no Spirits, so I can’t use Spirit Magic.<br/>
"The transformation skill is…really difficult…" (Makoto)<br/>
I am having Sa-san teach me in the free time at the inn, but it isn’t going well at all.<br/>
Different from the case of Sa-san where she had a unique skill for it originally, it looks like learning it from zero is pretty difficult.<br/>
What’s easy to transform to is something that’s similar to me.<br/>
Transformation to change genders is quite difficult.<br/>
So, I tried to transform into Fuji-yan first.<br/>
"Hmm, it doesn’t feel right." (Nina)<br/>
Nina-san saw through it with one look.<br/>
I couldn’t transform at all into Lucy or Sa-san.<br/>
"Eh? Transforming into me would mean that your body would turn into mine as well?" (Lucy)<br/>
Lucy hugged her own body as she asked.<br/>
What’s with you, treating someone like a pervert.<br/>
"Transforming into a girl acquaintance is insensitive, Takatsuki-kun." (Aya)<br/>
Even Sa-san! <br/>
Is that so…<br/>
The girls were not really in the mood, so I decided to wander around the city at night.<br/>
Horun’s public order is good even at night.<br/>
The Water Country’s knights were patrolling.<br/>
I also passed by the former guardian knight.<br/>
He didn’t make eye contact with me though.<br/>
After walking for a while, the circus trope’s tent came in sight.<br/>
The lights were off and no one was there.<br/>
"Right, how about transforming into the clown?" (Makoto)<br/>
The transformation skill can turn you into a similar appearance, but the fine details can be seen through by acquaintances.<br/>
With a clown, their features are clear, so it might work well.<br/>
I try using Transformation at the shadow of a tree.<br/>
"Ah, forgot a mirror…" (Makoto)<br/>
I can’t confirm.<br/>
Damn it.<br/>
At the moment when I thought I might as well return to the inn…<br/>
"Oi, what are you doing at a place like that?" <br/>
An unknown man spoke to me.<br/>
Shit, an acquaintance of the clown!<br/>
It seems like I transformed properly though.<br/>
"A-Aah, I had some business." <br/>
Let’s just play it off.<br/>
"Tomorrow we are doing the finishing touches. Everything’s perfect, I hope." <br/>
What is he talking about?<br/>
The clown did say that there will be a big event tomorrow, or something like that.<br/>
"Yeah, no problems." <br/>
Don’t know what though…<br/>
"Alright, don’t mess up. I am looking forward to the surprised faces of the people in the capital." <br/>
He grinned.<br/>
His face when smiling looked pretty evil, with how dim the place is and all, as he left.<br/>
(Sorry, clown guy…) (Makoto)<br/>
If it were an important message, it would be one thing, but it seemed like it was just to confirm something.<br/>
It…should be okay.<br/>
"Let’s return quick." (Makoto)<br/>
I undid the transformation and returned to the inn.<br/>
Let’s not transform into strangers without thinking.<br/>
