Crepe Tree<br/>
"Next is Kiel, huh." (Naofumi)<br/>
"Nii-chan. I want to quickly go to that tree’s side so please hurry up." (Kiel)<br/>
What’s with that attitude.<br/>
Do you even realise that you’re being scolded right now?<br/>
Well, I’m also a perpetrator so I can’t speak so harshly, but I do feel a little irritation.<br/>
By the way, that tree Kiel was referring to is a seed she planted in the corner of the village and raised into a tree.<br/>
That seed grew very quickly, and was bearing fruit or something.<br/>
I haven’t looked around much because it was still early morning, but I had noticed a sweet smell.<br/>
Or rather, there was a tree that was producing bread in the middle of the village.<br/>
What’s with that. Stay within the limits of fantasy, what happens if someone gets sick from eating that! But when I complained in astonishment, I was told that it was something I made when I was crazy.<br/>
Ah Jeez….<br/>
Kiel probably had me make something for her as well.<br/>
"Then should I chop down that tree as punishment?" (Naofumi)<br/>
"Nii-chan! Even if it’s Nii-chan, I’ll never forgive you!" (Kiel)<br/>
"It’ll grow back anyway." (Naofumi)<br/>
"Nii-chan told me it can’t regrow." (Kiel)<br/>
"The Bread Tree appears to have reproduction capabilities though?" (Naofumi)<br/>
Kiel transformed into her Kielberus form and growled.<br/>
Well, she’s tied up so she can’t move, and my slave crest should keep her quiet.<br/>
Hmm…… all the same, I can’t bear to do something she’d hate so much.<br/>
Assigning a punishment that goes beyond reflection is just abuse.<br/>
"Well then, Kiel." (Naofumi)<br/>
"What, Nii-chan?" (Kiel)<br/>
"Take the form of an ordinary girl from now on. Loincloths are prohibited. And you must wear the clothes that Imia provides." (Naofumi)<br/>
"Eeehhhh!?" (Kiel)<br/>
Kiel raised a fuss with all her strength, seeming very reluctant.<br/>
This much shouldn’t be considered abuse.<br/>
"And go peddling like that. Your assignment is to gather as many fans as Firo has, and you’re to remain as a girl until you do." (Naofumi)<br/>
"I-I get it, Nii-chan." (Kiel)<br/>
"Is this much fine?" (Naofumi)<br/>
"I think that’s a little soft." (Raphtalia)<br/>
Is that so?<br/>
I intended to provoke her with this quite unreasonable demand to reach Firo’s scale though.<br/>
Honestly, the degree of difficulty is higher when compared to Firo and Atla.<br/>
However, Kiel’s peddling records are good.<br/>
If I send her out, she might be able to achieve it.<br/>
"But that’s how Naofumi-sama is." (Raphtalia)<br/>
It seems like I’ll be self-destructing if I butt-in awkwardly so I’ll just agree.<br/>
In reality, I feel reluctant to scold them harshly while having faults of my own.<br/>
Of course, I wouldn’t feel anything if it were a complete stranger but even if they’re bad, I won’t be so heartless as to go so far with my subordinates.<br/>
Yeah, I’d feel ashamed.<br/>
"God of the Shield-sama, what’s the matter?" (Slave)<br/>
"!" (Naofumi)<br/>
It’s this.<br/>
The slaves who were originally undergoing medical treatment in the laboratory, every one of them call me God.<br/>
Because of this, the damage to my heart every time they say it….<br/>
"Hey, please call me the Hero of the Shield if you can. Or, you can call me Shield-niichan like the other guys." (Naofumi)<br/>
"What are you saying. The great God of the Shield-sama, we cannot do such an awe-inspiring thing." (Slave)<br/>
Ugh…a refreshing smile pierces me.<br/>
To be called a God like this is painful.<br/>
"Next up is for Naofumi-sama to punish himself…. that’s it, isn’t it?" (Raphtalia)<br/>
"Maybe." (Naofumi)<br/>
….That’s right.<br/>
I don’t have any memory of it but I’m aware that I caused quite a disturbance.<br/>
"I’ll restrain myself from more of my miserly actions. I don’t want to have to do much self-torturing though." (Naofumi)<br/>
"You do have a point. Sorry. Naofumi-sama has the task of fighting the waves so let’s not do too much. I will inform everyone." (Raphtalia)<br/>
"Thanks." (Naofumi)<br/>
I feel like it’s not really fair that I’m the only one not punished, but the only ones I punished for following the crazy me are Atla, Firo and Kiel so…. it’s fine.<br/>
"However.." (Naofumi)<br/>
I surveyed the village.<br/>
It’s become rather big thanks to the population and monsters increasing on a large scale.<br/>
It’s already on its way to becoming a town.<br/>
"It’s been developing, hasn’t it." (Naofumi)<br/>
"Yeah…" (Raphtalia)<br/>
The slaves recuperating in the laboratory were also able to recover so in the end… it was all good, or so I justify and console myself.<br/>
"Alright! Let’s go raise our levels today as well and prepare for the waves." (Naofumi)<br/>
"Okay." (Raphtalia)<br/>
Well… Firo is on a date with Motoyasu so I needed another monster to be our transport but when I request it, Firo’s number one subordinate comes forward, pushing away the modified Raph species and Filorials.<br/>
I want to decline if I can, but somehow I’m in an awkward situation and there’s unspoken pressure compelling me to bring her.<br/>
It’s not like she did anything bad in particular.<br/>
Just that… I wonder what it is. The way she looks at me bothers me.<br/>
"Hey Raphtalia." (Naofumi)<br/>
"What is it?" (Raphtalia)<br/>
"Kue." (Piyo)<br/>
I point to Firo’s number one subordinate who was resting at a distance and ask Raphtalia.<br/>
"That guy’s acting rather weird but do you know anything about it?" (Naofumi)<br/>
"Let’s see…. all of the Filorials in the village went to follow Naofumi-sama, so…" (Raphtalia)<br/>
"Is that so?" (Naofumi)<br/>
"Yes. In the beginning, they accompanied us but after that child was abducted…. somehow she became strange after that." (Raphtalia)<br/>
"Kue…." (Piyo)<br/>
Don’t look at me with such passionate eyes.<br/>
It’s a vivid reminder of Firo when she was in heat, so it’s somewhat unpleasant.<br/>
"Did she fight?" (Naofumi)<br/>
"Yes…she was caught at the seventh tower." (Raphtalia)<br/>
"I see…" (Naofumi)<br/>
Is she in heat?<br/>
"Kuee." (Piyo)<br/>
Firo’s number one subordinate who defeated the monsters approached with her head lowered as if wanting to be praised.<br/>
You speak, don’t you.<br/>
"Yes yes, alright." (Naofumi)<br/>
I stroked her appropriately, but for some reason she endeavoured to have me stroke the base of her throat.<br/>
Huh? Didn’t this guy used to know when to quit?<br/>
Somehow she’s changed a little.<br/>
"Kueeee…." (Piyo)<br/>
She looks like she’s in an extremely good mood.<br/>
Well, it’s fine to stroke her since it doesn’t feel bad, but this guy is that cutesy kid so I don’t really like it.<br/>
And when I find a good time to part, she cries out very reluctantly.<br/>
What’s with that.<br/>
That mystery was established at noon the next day.<br/>
When Firo told us drowsily, having finished her one-day date.<br/>
"Hey Firo." (Naofumi)<br/>
"Huh~… wha~t?" (Firo)<br/>
"Subordinate Number One’s behaviour is weird. Isn’t she aiming for your position?" (Naofumi)<br/>
"What do you mean~?" (Firo)<br/>
I point to her number one subordinate who was staring at me from in hiding.<br/>
"Ah, Piyo-chan? It’s alright~ That was, you know~ just her madly in love with Master~" (Firo)<br/>
"……." (Naofumi)<br/>
So that guy was called Piyo.<br/>
I had forgotten her real name. I feel like I’ve even been told before though.<br/>
Or rather, Hey.<br/>
"…..Wait, you’re saying something very omnious." (Naofumi)<br/>
"That’s right. Why is that child madly in love?" (Raphtalia)<br/>
"You see~ it was after Firo became able to fly. Master, you see. You told me to go abduct Piyo-chan so I brought her, and then.. Master, Piyo-chan―" (Firo)<br/>
"Wh-what did he do?" (Raphtalia)<br/>
I also nodded to Raphtalia’s question.<br/>
I’m worried about what it means by that cutesy kid becoming so clingy.<br/>
"….Firo was very envious, when I said to do it to me as well, Master said ‘You’ve already pledged your allegiance to me so no, and I only did it because it’s effective on this guy'" (Firo)<br/>
"What did he do!" (Raphtalia)<br/>
I don’t understand Firo’s explanation!<br/>
It can’t be helped. It’s regrettable but let’s try asking Atla.<br/>
I head towards Atla’s place, who was irritated about Fohl being a hindrance.<br/>
"Ah, you! Why is it your side that’s coming!" (Fohl)<br/>
Fohl said in a displeased voice as I approached.<br/>
Yesterday was…. well, he was an unrefined body pillow.<br/>
I want to ask something unreasonable of Raphtalia and invite a Raph.<br/>
"Sorry. There’s something on my mind that I want to ask Atla about." (Naofumi)<br/>
"Well, I wonder what it is. Naofumi-sama? If it’s now, I’ll do anything for you." (Atla)<br/>
You’d do anything even if it wasn’t now, I don’t need you to tell me that.<br/>
That is to say, it was already broadcasted…<br/>
"So Firo’s subordinate, Piyo. What did I do to her?" (Naofumi)<br/>
"It was personal grooming." (Atla)<br/>
"Personal grooming?" (Naofumi)<br/>
"Yes. That is… the already captured Piyo-chan exposed her hostility and thanks to her pledging allegiance, turning her fury affectionate and doing a rich personal grooming, the Filorials converted to Naofumi-sama’s camp." (Atla)<br/>
"Rich?" (Naofumi)<br/>
"Yes. I cannot remember how many times Piyo-chan raised her voice in pleasure." (Atla)<br/>
"Naofumi-sama!?" (Raphtalia)<br/>
"He has no memory of it!" (Atla)<br/>
Eh? Is this a metaphor?<br/>
Was I raped by Subordinate Number One or something?<br/>
"Firo, was I assaulted by Subordinate Number One?" (Naofumi)<br/>
"Trying to conceive children? You’re wrong~" (Firo)<br/>
Apparently I’m wrong.<br/>
Or I should say, don’t talk about conceiving children.<br/>
"Firo also wants to be caressed like that~ ….I was envious….. to say something similar, it’s like the feeling he had when Master stroked the little Onee-chan today, almost to the point of ecstasy~" (Firo) [T/N: Little Onee-chan = Raph Species]<br/>
"Naofumi-sama? When did you…." (Raphtalia)<br/>
Geh…..<br/>
Actually, I was stroking the concealed Raph.<br/>
I really like the feel of them.<br/>
But Raphtalia gets upset when I stroke them so I had been doing it in hiding.<br/>
Why am I being treated like I’ve been unfaithful.<br/>
Anyway, to stroke them with that kind of feeling…. so it was having them pledge allegiance.<br/>
I don’t understand what the pledge means.<br/>
"Tell me if you saw me! Or rather, if the Raph are no good then Raphtalia! Let me stroke your tail." (Naofumi)<br/>
What am I saying? It’s turning into sexual harassment.<br/>
It’s a case of reversed anger. [T/N: Being angry at someone who would normally be angry at you]<br/>
"Eh…ah…uhh. I-I understand. It’s fine to stroke the Raph as long as it’s within my eyesight." (Raphtalia)<br/>
As I expected, it’s better than stroking her tail. [T/N: Raphtalia doesn’t want her tail stroked no matter what.]<br/>
I don’t know which is proving fortunate.<br/>
"Then how do I make Subordinate Number 1 be obedient?" (Naofumi)<br/>
"I think it’ll be fine if you did it for a while, Piyo-chan~? About Master, I said before that Firo’s love is different." (Firo)<br/>
"Ah, right." (Naofumi)<br/>
"But stroke me occasionally." (Firo)<br/>
Sigh…Filorials are very weird.<br/>
As expected, the Raph are best.<br/>
They aren’t vulgar.<br/>
No, it might just be that I haven’t confirmed it yet.<br/>
Or rather, I’m probably too pleased with them.<br/>
"Ah, they said Kiel-kun’s Crepe Tree is bearing fruit, Master, let’s go eat." (Firo)<br/>
"Wait wait, what Crepe Tree?" (Naofumi)<br/>
I’ve heard about the Bread Tree but…. so it’s what Kiel was talking about when she was being punished.<br/>
That was also made by me, huh.<br/>
"Naofumi-sama, me too." (Atla)<br/>
"You’re not allowed." (Naofumi)<br/>
"Aww…." (Atla)<br/>
Atla really is a dangerous fellow.<br/>
She agrees no matter what I do.<br/>
Despite this, I know that it’ll turn bad if she continues to obey.<br/>
If possible, I’d like her think for herself and not depend on me.<br/>
In the past, I said this to Raphtalia.<br/>
<From an objective point of view, you and your companions need to be careful><br/>
Right, it’s an objective point of view.<br/>
We must sharpen ourselves to be seen as splendid from a stranger’s perspective.<br/>
I’d want put in a great effort and chase my ideals together with my partner, and have them acknowledge my current self, instead of depending on them.<br/>
Furthermore, I followed those words.<br/>
<You can’t believe that you can do anything just because you are a companion of a hero. Try not to inconvenience anyone.><br/>
I don’t care about the world after the waves.<br/>
However, Raphtalia will remain in this world, so I must secure a place for her to belong.<br/>
I will make a world where Raphtalia can be happy even without me.<br/>
One way or another, a problem is emerging with the slaves here being dependant on me.<br/>
From now on, I will have them rely on Raphtalia and the others first, and if it still isn’t resolved then I can make my appearance.<br/>
…Huh? Isn’t that no different to how it was before I turned crazy….?<br/>
Yeah, it’s because Kiel, who should have been assisting Raphtalia, went on a rampage.<br/>
So I have no choice but have the slaves who are motivated, with the exception of Kiel, work hard.<br/>
"Raphtalia." (Naofumi)<br/>
"What is it?" (Raphtalia)<br/>
"Of the guys originally born in the village, please aid and train those who have leadership like Kiel. If possible, the guys who aren’t too attached to me." (Naofumi)<br/>
"….Okay." (Raphtalia)<br/>
Kiel showed hostility from the start, but she’s now become too attached.<br/>
In the beginning, I somehow destroyed the ruins of the home she originally lived in, so how can she be so attached to me.<br/>
There’s also the effect of food, but she’s a charismatic person by nature.<br/>
And she doesn’t think too deeply but acts on her instincts like Firo, so I want an intelligence faction.<br/>
Piyo is like that but Firo is her superior so that’s also troublesome.<br/>
And, as we were talking, we ―― became speechless.<br/>
"Wh-what is this!" (Naofumi)<br/>
Firo called it the Crepe Tree, but it really is a crepe tree!<br/>
There were flower-like things which were round dough pieces blooming, with fruit wrapped in their center, and they changed shape as they ripened.<br/>
Bugs or something seemed to be gathering, was that alright?<br/>
Then again, the nectar-filled depressions, where the bugs were gathering, were in various parts of the tree.<br/>
Somehow, when I peer inside… inside the depressions were carnivorous plants and inside, it seemed the bugs were being converted into nourishment<br/>
It was ripening with nutrients from this bug?<br/>
Ugh… it’s quite a disgusting tree….<br/>
"Ah, Nii-chan!" (Kiel)<br/>
Kiel addressed me, picking crepes off the tree.<br/>
In her hand she grasped crepes intended for us to eat.<br/>
"Will Nii-chan eat too?" (Kiel)<br/>
"No…give me a break." (Naofumi)<br/>
"Is that so? It’s super yummy though? But it doesn’t have as much flavour as Nii-chan’s handmade food." (Kiel)<br/>
"I’ve also become unable to cook because of the curse." (Naofumi)<br/>
"That’s why this tree has the tastiest desserts right now." (Kiel)<br/>
Kiel answered with confidence.<br/>
As I expect, it’d be impossible for this guy to be a Sub-leader.<br/>
Her actions are too erratic.<br/>
"Kiel-kun. One of the villagers said this, but is it true that you won’t separate from this tree?" (Raphtalia)<br/>
"That’s right! Cos I never know when a thief might come!" (Kiel)<br/>
So Kiel has always been sleeping by the Crepe Tree ever since we returned to the village?<br/>
She must treasure it a lot.<br/>
"Keep it moderate, okay." (Naofumi)<br/>
"I’ve got it Nii-chan. Ah, does Firo-chan also want a crepe?" (Kiel)<br/>
"Yeah!" (Firo)<br/>
Firo stuffed her cheeks with the delicious crepe.<br/>
That….is a crepe produced with nutrients from bugs, right? I’ve lost my appetite….but let’s not say that aloud.<br/>
Firo would be indifferent about eating bugs and stuff anyway.<br/>
Incidentally, Kiel started living in a kennel that was established next to the tree so I constructed a temporary dwelling using a Bioplant to stave off the wind and rain.<br/>
Kiel… you said you were going to protect your precious house, didn’t you. The house you neglected will cry.<br/>
Or, has it become House = Crepe Tree? Please stop with the jokes.<br/>
Afterwards, Kiel poured her efforts into looking after the Crepe Tree, and the Crepe Tree also grew as if responding to her affection.<br/>
Subsequently, the legendary Crepe Wood became a local specialty and the moment of its birth… just kidding.<br/>
"I’d like you to not get carried away with any jokes." (Naofumi)<br/>
"That’s right." (Raphtalia)<br/>
Raphtalia replies while giving the Raph a sidelong glance.<br/>
I understand it. I’d feel the same if there was a copycat who resembled me.<br/>
<br/>
