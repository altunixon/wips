Ch. 70: Being Summoned After Revival<br/>
 <br/>
“I guess it’s all settled now?”<br/>
Seeing that Al and Feim had no will to fight anymore, Klaus asked Loren, but Loren didn’t say anything and just shrugged.<br/>
He was able to subdue them with only coercion, but he felt that it was mostly due to Shayna, who was puffing out her chest proudly in the corner of his eye.<br/>
It was hard to think that they, as future adventurers, even though they were currently students, would lose the will to fight at one glance.<br/>
“Tie them up with rope or something for now. It’ll be troublesome if they start acting up again.”<br/>
“You mean all of them, right?”<br/>
Klaus sent a pitiful glance towards Ain and Cloud, who were on the floor.<br/>
The two were in a bad state, as they seemed unrelated to this matter, but they were used by Al and ended up being knocked out by Loren.<br/>
Klaus wondered if they really needed to tie them up, but since they weren’t sure if they were still under the influence of <<Hypno>> or not, there was a need to neutralize them.<br/>
Klaus knew that, but he couldn’t help but feel bad for them.<br/>
“All of them. Unfortunate for them, but let’s just put it as mismanagement of their companions.”<br/>
“Okay.”<br/>
Klaus nodded and started tying Feim and Al with the rope that Ange had brought out of her bag.<br/>
“What should we do now?”<br/>
Lapis, looking at the process, asked Loren.<br/>
“Well…I guess we go back to the surface using the transport gate, right?”<br/>
“What should we do about that?”<br/>
Loren turned to where Lapis was pointing, and his face hardened as he saw what was there.<br/>
In his sight was the box that Al had dropped, which supposedly sealed an evil god inside.<br/>
The box, which had been an ordinary metal box when Al had been holding it, was lying on the floor, but some of the designs on its surface started emitting an eerie purple light.<br/>
“Oh, come on…Don’t tell me…”<br/>
“For some reason, I agree with what you’re thinking.”<br/>
It was already proved that the abnormality of the dungeon, which was supposedly caused by the near revival of the evil god, and what Al had been planning were unrelated.<br/>
In that case, Al already being apprehended, with no more will to fight, was a separate problem than the evil god’s revival.<br/>
“Don’t tell me it’s going to revive right now!?”<br/>
“Such bad timing.”<br/>
Loren started to panic, but on the other hand, Lapis was very calm.<br/>
Of course, it wasn’t because she had a way to deal with what was happening before them.<br/>
“W-what’s going to happen!?”<br/>
As Parme, who had been watching everything quietly, cried out in dismay, the box on the floor slowly started glowing brighter and started emitting flashes of purple light, and anyone could see that it wasn’t normal.<br/>
“Ah, the evil god is reviving to save me in my time of trouble!”<br/>
“Klaus, smack him and shut him up, will you?”<br/>
When Loren told him, seeing Al crying out, becoming all emotional and wiggling on the ground like a worm, Klaus sighed and struck him on the back of the head.<br/>
Al lost focus for a second, but he quickly recovered and pushed Klaus away, and started crawling towards the box, glowing with intense light.<br/>
“Now, lend me your power!”<br/>
“Shut up and stay asleep.”<br/>
Loren said with a frown and dropped his heel onto the back of Al’s head.<br/>
Along with a very blunt sound, the blow seemed to have knocked him out, as Al’s body gave one last shudder before he stopped moving.<br/>
Everyone else thought he was dead, but Loren didn’t seem like he cared, as he kicked him back and turned to the box.<br/>
“What do we do about this?”<br/>
“I don’t think there’s much we can do at this point.”<br/>
As Lapis said in a give up tone, Loren thought for a moment and said to her like the thought just popped up in his head.<br/>
“How about we pretend we didn’t see anything and return to the surface?”<br/>
“I think it’s a bit too late for that.”<br/>
Klaus and the others gave a bored look at Loren’s heartless proposal.<br/>
Lapis said out loud as she continued looking at the box with a great deal of interest.<br/>
“I think something is coming out.”<br/>
“I was afraid it would be something like that.”<br/>
Nothing had gone right for Loren ever since he quit being a mercenary.<br/>
He had started acknowledging his bad luck, so he already had a vague feeling that he wasn’t going to be able to just walk away from it like throwing away rotten food.<br/>
“It’s coming. Brace yourselves, everyone.”<br/>
If they were to trust what they had been hearing about what was in the box, it meant that whatever was coming out was an evil god.<br/>
If they witnessed something like that manifest in the current world, who knew what else could happen.<br/>
As they prepared themselves at Lapis’ warning, the box on the floor started emitting the brightest light yet.<br/>
Loren kept his eyes on the box, and within the blinding light, he saw the shape of the box crumble and increase in area, reshaping itself.<br/>
Eventually the light died, and a young-looking man stood in front of them.<br/>
He had sleepy eyes and unkempt hair.<br/>
<br/>
His clothes were ordinary ones you could find anywhere, but what caught Loren’s attention was his sleepy eyes.<br/>
His eyes were purple.<br/>
“Whew. Where is this place?”<br/>
As the sleepy looking man turned towards Loren and Lapis, scratching his head, Loren raised his great sword and glanced at Lapis.<br/>
Lapis caught Loren glimpsing at her, realized what he was wondering, and shook her head.<br/>
Only demons had purple eyes.<br/>
Loren believed that a demon had come out instead of an evil god and wasn’t sure if he should be relieved that it wasn’t an evil god, or if he should be worried that he may have to confront a demon.<br/>
He looked at Lapis, wondering if it was someone she knew, but from her response, it didn’t seem like it was.<br/>
“No answer, huh…Whatever, I guess I’ll start off with finding someplace to sleep.”<br/>
“Who are you?”<br/>
The man, who stifled a yawn, lost interest in them and started to turn away when Loren called out to him.<br/>
The man opened his mouth to answer his question, but after opening and closing it repeatedly, he eventually sat down.<br/>
“Too much work to answer.”<br/>
“Are you the evil god that the adventurer named Volf sealed?”<br/>
Loren decided that since there was a story, his question wouldn’t be too far off from the truth, and the man laid down onto his side and answered him, not even bothering to look at him.<br/>
“Yeah. I remember people calling me the evil god of sloth. There were so many people trying to kill me back then, it was troubling.”<br/>
“So, you’re an evil god?”<br/>
“Does that really matter? All I want to do is be asleep.”<br/>
The man rolled over towards Loren and continued.<br/>
“I remember the guy named Volf. I let him seal me because he said that I could sleep all I want to. I wonder why I was able to break out?”<br/>
“The seal most likely deteriorated over the years.”<br/>
Lapis said quietly.<br/>
“There is no such thing as a seal that lasts forever, after all. If hundreds of years passed, the chains would loosen.”<br/>
“Oh, that much time has passed, huh. Then I guess Volf is already dead.”<br/>
The man pulled himself up and sat crossed legged.<br/>
“Then I guess that means a lot of things have changed outside. Looking around sounds fun. Even though it sounds like a lot of work.”<br/>
“Is there the option of being sealed again?”<br/>
Loren asked out of desperation, but the man shook his head.<br/>
“At first I thought it would be fine to be sealed again and continue sleeping. But it’s quite uncomfortable inside. I’d rather sleep on a soft bed if I could.”<br/>
“There’s no way we could let an evil god out of here!”<br/>
Klaus raised his sword and shouted.<br/>
Next to him, Ange pointed her staff towards the man and prepared to cast a spell.<br/>
After looking at the two of them, annoyed, the man turned his gaze towards Loren, who was still not sure what he should do, and Lapis.<br/>
“What about you two?”<br/>
“Difficult question. I would prefer if you would behave.”<br/>
“What if I said I don’t want to.”<br/>
“That’s…”<br/>
“Ahh whatever. Listening to your answer is too much trouble.”<br/>
Loren thought it was selfish of him, since he was the one who asked, but the man didn’t seem to care, as he put a finger on the floor and started writing something.<br/>
Klaus moved before even considering what the man’s actions were.<br/>
He used <<Boost>> to close the gap between them in an instant and swung his sword at the man’s neck before he could even react.<br/>
Everyone thought that the man’s head would fly off with blood flying everywhere.<br/>
But reality betrayed their expectations, as although Klaus’ blow met the man’s neck, his blade moved no more.<br/>
“What!?”<br/>
“Your skills aren’t bad, but your weapon is. You probably won’t even be able to cut my nails with something as blunt as that.”<br/>
Klaus jumped back, shocked that his blow hadn’t even made a scratch.<br/>
The man didn’t seem to care about following, as he continued to write on the floor, and retreated his finger when he was done.<br/>
“I’ll leave something to keep you guys busy, just in case, so have fun. If fate allows, I’ll see you…that might be too troublesome, actually…”<br/>
After saying that, the man’s body started sinking into the floor.<br/>
Apparently, he was thinking of retreating as he summoned something, but Loren couldn’t follow, as the words that the man had written started glowing.<br/>
“Putting meeting again aside, how about you name yourself?”<br/>
Loren asked the man, knowing there was no way to stop him, and as he continued sinking deeper into the floor, he looked at Loren with sleepy eyes, and said one last thing before he sank completely.<br/>
“Evil god of sloth, Dauna Slotharcadia. I have a feeling we’ll see each other again.”<br/>
After those last words, he sank through completely.<br/>
At the same time, a pitch-black, unstructured lump appeared from underneath, as if it traded places with the man.<br/>
“Another slime!?”<br/>
As he cried out, wanting a break from slimes, the giant black slime that had been summoned started moving towards them.<br/>
