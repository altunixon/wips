Intermission: Tama<br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
Wagahai is Tama de Aru¹, the name given by master.<br/>
<br/>
Tama has a family nyan.<br/>
A really strong and kind master, and Pochi who's like a little sister and Liza who's like a mother. And also cheeky Arisa and docile Lulu. Everyone is not a cat-person, but they're all important family nyan.<br/>
<br/>
Arisa said that if I use, "Nyan", master will be happy, but it's a lie. Far from being happy, he's worried instead.<br/>
<br/>
"Okay~ Here we go~. Everyone, follow me~."<br/>
<br/>
Arisa is leading the way while running. Today is a shopping day.<br/>
New clothes! Fluttering and fluffy, cute clothes with no weird smell.<br/>
<br/>
"If Pochi was to wear this clothes then Tama would be cool with this sharp one I guess?"<br/>
"This ribbon is better~?"<br/>
<br/>
Not the one that Arisa recommends, but the matching one with Pochi with a small ribbon attached is what I want.<br/>
<br/>
"Ara? That's unexpected, you like cute things huh~."<br/>
<br/>
I don't know how to use money, so it's Arisa who buys it.<br/>
<br/>
After the shopping is over, we eat a lot and lot of meats with the leftover money. I am very happy.<br/>
We pass by a park, I see a nice sunny spot for napping, then I notice master there.<br/>
<br/>
"Master~?"<br/>
<br/>
I run to him to talk, he looks in pain somewhere.<br/>
Pochi who runs with me together looks worried too.<br/>
<br/>
"Tummy hurt~?"<br/>
"I'm alright, I might be tired though."<br/>
<br/>
Master says so while patting my head. I want to be patted more, I rub my head against master's hand.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
◇<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
The outside! I'm going outside the city for the first time.<br/>
Arisa asks, "Didn't you live outside the city when you were small?", but I only remember the winter chill and the warmth of someone's fur.<br/>
Alhough I clearly remember the time when I met Pochi, I don't really remember past things.<br/>
<br/>
Pochi wasn't able to speak words and just groaned with, "Gururu~", but I worked hard to teach her words. Since I'm the onee-chan.<br/>
<br/>
The wagon is shaking here and there, it's fun. Since Arisa and Lulu cry their butts hurt, I ask, "Are you okay~?". Arisa screams back, "Nothing is impossible with human's intelligence!", but I don't really understand the meaning. Arisa's words are fun, but I always don't understand them. She's a strange child.<br/>
<br/>
Arisa teaches me many things. [Janken], [Guppa], [Hopping], [Card play], [Anisong], a lot, lots of things.<br/>
Next time, if I catch a prey, I'll give it to Arisa.<br/>
<br/>
The scenery is flowing while I'm sitting beside master, it's fun. Pochi also sits beside master on the other side.<br/>
<br/>
"Nya!"<br/>
<br/>
Just now, a prey is in that thicket!<br/>
I tried to jump out, but Liza gripped my girdle so I wasn't able to jump out. Too bad.<br/>
<br/>
The wagon shakes and Arisa complains. Even though wagons are for shaking things, Arisa is really strange.<br/>
Pochi counterattacks Arisa who rides on her head. Uu~ I want to join in. But, I'm the onee-chan so I'll endure. Uu~, endure... impossble nyan♪<br/>
<br/>
I play with Pochi and Arisa until Liza stops us.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
◇<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Uu~, I catch glimpse of many preys.<br/>
But, until master has ordered me, endure it, endure.<br/>
<br/>
"Private Pochi! Private Tama!"<br/>
"Ay!"<br/>
"Yes nanodesu!"<br/>
<br/>
I take on the pose Arisa has taught yesterday, "Swoosh!", and answer master.<br/>
<br/>
"I will assign you two a mission! Check the security around the perimeter of the boulders!"<br/>
"Ay!""Desu!"<br/>
<br/>
I chase after a rabbit that I've had my eyes on since earlier with Pochi.<br/>
<br/>
The rabbit is hopping around with, "Pyon pyon"-like sound.<br/>
Pochi and me are running together.<br/>
<br/>
It's slower than monsters nyan.<br/>
<br/>
I throw myself.<br/>
<br/>
Pyon pyon.<br/>
<br/>
Nyau, it ran away.<br/>
<br/>
Pyo~n.<br/>
<br/>
Pochi jumps on it.<br/>
<br/>
The rabbit twists its body and slips underneath Pochi.<br/>
<br/>
I won't let you run!<br/>
<br/>
Tou!<br/>
<br/>
But the rabbit dives into a hole hidden in the grass' shadow.<br/>
Uu~, if I go there, the clothes given by master will be dirtied.<br/>
<br/>
However, Pochi plunges into the hole without hesitation.<br/>
I'm the onee-chan after all, I'll give this rabbit to Pochi.<br/>
<br/>
I catch a snake loitering around under the rock. It's a snake with no poison and delicious.<br/>
But, it's a bit small. I look for the next prey while twirling my tail around, and come across Arisa who's looking for firewoods.<br/>
<br/>
"Arisa~?"<br/>
"Ara, Tama. Hmm? What are you holding?"<br/>
"Snake~"<br/>
<br/>
That's right, let's give it to Arisa.<br/>
It's a bit small, but it's good for snacks.<br/>
<br/>
"For you~?"<br/>
"Wa, no, don't come here."<br/>
"Not poison~?"<br/>
<br/>
Even though it's not a snake with poison, so it's fine.<br/>
Now, Arisa, go ahead and chew it from the head without reserve.<br/>
<br/>
"Wa, toss it away."<br/>
"Pow~?"<br/>
"Yes, turn around. spin and spin~, then throw it with a pow."<br/>
"Ay~."<br/>
<br/>
As Arisa says, I spin and spin~ and throw it.<br/>
Seems that it's a new play, but I don't understand the fun.<br/>
<br/>
"Yes, that's good."<br/>
<br/>
Arisa crosses her arms and nods with, uh-huh. Seems it was correct.<br/>
Arisa pick a firewood on her foot and go back to master.<br/>
<br/>
Next, for the sake of master, I'll look for a bigger prey.<br/>
<br/>
I chase after a dragonfly.<br/>
<br/>
I chase after a cricket.<br/>
<br/>
I found it.<br/>
<br/>
Conceal myself~, tou!<br/>
<br/>
I pin the prey from behind, and it faints just from that.<br/>
<br/>
Weak~?<br/>
<br/>
Even though it's a present for master, but I'm told, "Let it go."<br/>
Even though, it's a big prey~.<br/>
<br/>
But, it's an order from master, Tama will listen to what he says.<br/>
I spin and spin~ like Arisa taught me and toss it away.<br/>
<br/>
I was scolded by master.<br/>
<br/>
I must tell Arisa that it's bad to lie.<br/>
Because I'm the onee-chan.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
