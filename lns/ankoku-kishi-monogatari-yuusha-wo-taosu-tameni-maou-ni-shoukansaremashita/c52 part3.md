Chapter 52.3 : Library of Heaven<br/>
「Which reminds me, Dark Knight. What happened to the Silver Haired girl from before? 」<br/>
It seemed Goddess Totona remembered Kuna from when she came along with me to this place before.<br/>
「Kuna… has a little bit muscle ache.」<br/>
Right now, she’s still sleeping off the effects of our rigorous ‘exercise’. Then again, the fault lied on Kuna herself, who brewed the ‘tea’ that caused the Ferocious Dragon sleeping inside me to awaken. Due to that ‘tea’’s effect, I ended up ‘assaulting’ Kuna and the other women around me at that time.<br/>
And, due to that effect, I couldn’t restrain myself. By the time I managed to restrain myself, Kuna’s body was already tattered. So, that’s why she was sleeping right now.<br/>
And I think my body was still suffering with a problem. It seemed, to me, my body was still being influenced by that drug since the Ferocious Dragon in me was still awake. Fortunately, I somehow managed to suppress it with my rationality. Unfortunately, even the smallest trigger would let the Ferocious Dragon in me spring back without restraint.<br/>
Honestly speaking, it was almost out of control again since Goddess Totona smelt so nice.<br/>

「Muscle ache? What happened to her? 」<br/>
Goddess Totona asked, curious.<br/>
「No…. It’s okay, It isn’t…. That big deal.」<br/>
I replied, averting my gaze. Truthfully, it was an extremely BIG DEAL, but there’s no way I could tell anyone about it. Nevertheless, I never expected Goddess Totona to be worried about Kuna. I mean, Kuna was rude to her during our previous visit.<br/>
It seems Kuna simply couldn’t stand Goddess Totona. Then again, she acted the same way toward Regena too.<br/>
「I see…. Very well then. Come to think of it, there’s something that I need to tell you.」<br/>
Goddess Totona glared at me.<br/>
「And what could it be? 」<br/>
「Rena came to this place after you left before.」<br/>
「Rena? 」<br/>
Goddess Totona nodded.<br/>
「Rena gave me a warning not to approach you carelessly. She most probably has a spy in Nargol. After all, she knows that you visit this place.」<br/>

I was left in a shocked state when I heard her words. While I did consider the possibility of a spy in Nargol, I didn’t know who they were working for. The only definitive fact was that I noticed there were spies around. The rest remained mysteries. Besides, in the first place, Modes and the others were not really trying to protect their information. And, because of that, there was a huge leak of inside information to the opposing parties. And, since I didn’t explicitly hide this, the fact that I visited this place could be known by anyone in Nargol.<br/>
「My deepest apology, Goddess Totona.」<br/>
I bowed to her.<br/>
「What’s the matter, Dark Knight? Why did you suddenly apologize like that?」<br/>
「The one who will be troubled the most by me visiting this place should be you right, Totona-dono? It might be for better if I stop visiting this place.」<br/>
I didn’t want to bring more trouble to Goddess Totona. I mean, besides the fact that Modes only had few allies in Elios, he was in the middle of a dispute with the Gods of Elios, and Goddess Totona was part of Elios. Her standing might be affected if it’s known that I, Modes’ subordinate, his Dark Knight, was known to visit her library frequently. It wouldn’t be a good thing at all, so I had to avoid that situation no matter what.<br/>
「Are you kidding me! ! You’re not a bother at all! ! 」<br/>
Goddess Totona suddenly raised her voice.<br/>
「Eh….. Pardon? 」<br/>
I was startled when she suddenly raised her voice like that. And I couldn’t be blamed for being startled. After all, it was surprising to hear someone like Goddess Totona, who was always calm, raising her voice.<br/>

<br/>
「I don’t give a damn about Rena. Same goes for my mother. Nor do I give a damn about the gods of Elios. That’s why, please…. You must come again」<br/>
I couldn’t hear the last part of her sentence. But, since Goddess Totona’s face was already as red as a ripe tomato, I decided not to ask.<br/>
I really didn’t understand why she suddenly raised her voice. Nevertheless, I still wanted to visit this place again.<br/>
「Yes. I’ll come again for a visit whenever I’ve the time.」<br/>
I smiled as I told her that.<br/>
「I see, thank goodness…」<br/>
She said as a smile bloomed on her lips. This was the first time I ever saw her make such an expression and I couldn’t help myself when I thought that she is super cute.<br/>
「See you later then, Totona-dono. I have to go back since it’s already this late.」<br/>
「Wait a minute, Dark Knight.」<br/>
When I was about to turn around, Goddess Totona stopped me.<br/>
「What’s the matter？ 」<br/>
I looked over my shoulder to Goddess Totona.<br/>
「It’s not “Totona-dono”, just “Totona”. And, I also wanted your permission to call you with your real name.」<br/>

<br/>
Totona said with an expressionless face, but somehow I felt that she was anxious about this matter. So, I smiled to relieve her.<br/>
「Of course. Please take care of me, Totona.」<br/>
◆Dark Knight, Kuroki<br/>
When I returned to Nargol, I was greeted by the women from the demon race. According to the record I read just a while ago, the demon race was a race that was created by Modes using the Kettle of Life with the help of fragments of Goddess Mina’s body, that was provided by Heibos which might explain their beautiful appearances.<br/>
And, according to the story, after he was exiled to Nargol alongside his demon race, Modes decided to create the low ranked demons to help the demon race. In other words, these women were in fact the higher ranked demons of their race.<br/>
「Welcome back, Your excellency.」<br/>
Their representative greeted me, bowing in unison with the other welcoming women.<br/>
「I’m back, Guno-dono」<br/>
I bowed in return. The one who spoke to me was Guno, the leader of the Demon Race Female Knights, who served under me.<br/>
「Please lift your head, your excellency! ! We are just mere servants who devoted our bodies and souls to you, your excellency! ! That’s why please treat us like you would a servant! ! ! 」<br/>
Guno said with a serious look on her face. She was not the only one as the other women made the same expression as her. Even so, I could only feel a pang of regret when I saw those expressions on their faces.<br/>
The reason was because they just happened to be in THAT place when Kuna served me that ‘tea’. And, although they didn’t bear the brunt of it unlike Kuna, I still remembered that they were still quite tattered themselves at the end. And, while they swore a pledge of absolute obedience towards me after that event, it only made my stomach hurt whenever I recalled it.<br/>

<br/>
<br/>
「I…. I see. Thank you very much for your loyalty.」<br/>
Thus why, even as I said those words, I felt that my stomach was hurting even more. However, the women before me only made an entranced face when I said those words.<br/>
「Hahaha…..」<br/>
I went into the mansion, letting out dry laughter as I did so. Then, I went to Kuna’s bedroom. She leaped onto my chest as soon as she saw me.<br/>
「Welcome back, Kuroki. I was so lonely.」<br/>
Kuna said with wet eyes, and that expression made my heart beat even faster than usual.<br/>
Whoah. That’s a dangerous face there. She almost awoke the dangerous Violent Dragon.<br/>
「Sorry, Kuna. How’s your body? 」<br/>
Kuna nodded when I asked.<br/>
「It’s okay. I’ll be fine next time it happens.」<br/>
Seriously, there’s still a next time. I unintentionally retorted in my mind.<br/>
「Right. Even so, you still need some rest, okay.」<br/>
I said as I carried Kuna to the canopy bed in a princess carry. I then tried to lay by her side.<br/>
「Your excellency. May I interrupt you for a moment? 」<br/>
However, before I could do so, someone knocked on the door; just after I put Kuna down on the bed.<br/>
「What’s the matter, Guno-dono? 」<br/>
「His Majesty sent a message to you. He said that there’s a matter that he has to tell you about. Thus he asked you to come to the Demon King Castle.」<br/>
Modes has business with me? Just what in the world?<br/>
「Understood. I’ll be preparing myself.」<br/>
I got up and readied myself to go to the Demon King Castle.<br/>
