Dinner<br/>
Edited by EverydaySoCloudy<br/>
We were guided to dinner with the queen after resting in a VIP room.<br/>
As the guided by the soldiers, we saw the luxurious tables throughout the hall.<br/>
Isn’t this even more luxurious than the time Motoyasu and I dueled?<br/>
<br/>
……It’s been a long time.<br/>
But my innocence has finally been proven.<br/>
I see the queen and Melty entered the hall holding hands.<br/>
The two of them approach me while looking like they have something to say.<br/>
Naofumi:"What’s wrong?"<br/>
Queen:"Well……Oh dear, I’ll just tell you truthfully."<br/>
Naofumi:"?"<br/>
While I was looking puzzled, the queen muttered about something being deplorable.<br/>
It seems that Bitch and Trash proposed to carry a dish from the kitchen to me.<br/>
They reflected. Therefore they want to bring me a dish as some kind of atonement.<br/>
This information is immediately heard by the queen<br/>
The two of them snatched two dishes by force in the hallway to bring to me.<br/>
This happened while the queen was in the hall preparing.<br/>
Queen:"It is an admirable attitude to carry the food."<br/>
Both of them had cold sweat running down their back as they tried to put the food on my side.<br/>
However, the queen ordered the soldiers to arrest them.<br/>
I heard the circumstances from the shadows supervising them in advance.<br/>
Trash:"Wh-What are you doing!?"<br/>
Bitch:"I did not do anything!"<br/>
They were protesting while being arrested.<br/>
When caught, their reaction is as follows.<br/>
Queen:"Yes, I pray you did nothing too. Now then, both of you…… eat a mouthful of the food you tried to serve Iwatani-sama."<br/>
Trash:"Such an impolite thing will not be done!"<br/>
Bitch:"I did not do anything!"<br/>
Their pitiful selves repeat an excuse while resisting.<br/>
Queen:"Yes, I believe you. So eat."<br/>
Trash:"That would be rude to the shield!"<br/>
Bitch:"That’s right! Something that was has already eaten should not be served!"<br/>
Queen:" That’s alright. Just take a bit with some clean tableware."<br/>
Trash:"Certainly not!"<br/>
Bitch:"Disgusting!"<br/>
Queen:" Eat it!"<br/>
The soldiers force-feed the two of them the dishes they carried.<br/>
(ED: There is a short time skip here that isn’t mentioned)<br/>
Naofumi:" So, what has happened to them?"<br/>
Queen:" Trash went to the toilet, and Bitch was carried to the hospital."<br/>
Are they retarded?<br/>
Trash used a laxative, and Bitch used poison.<br/>
I should be fine thanks to poison resistance, but I don’t exactly have a hobby of consuming poison.<br/>
However, these guys clearly aren’t reflecting at all.<br/>
It would have been an excellent assassination. But their execution leaves much to be desired.<br/>
Naofumi:"They are going to be punished for this right?"<br/>
Queen:"Naturally. I’ll give Trash and Bitch a painful experience every day until they give up."<br/>
Naofumi:"Uh huh……"<br/>
Queen:" It was good that they were caught so early. There was a chance that Iwatani-sama might have actually taken damage."<br/>
Naofumi:"I guess……"<br/>
Those guys didn’t learn their lesson…… they don’t deserve any praise for their tenacity.<br/>
It would be fine to be angry here, let’s try to evaluate the queen’s enthusiasm in punishing them.<br/>
Naofumi:" Observe them closely. If they are unhurt I will withdraw our agreement.<br/>
Queen:" Of course. Originally, the contents of their punishment would be supervised, then reported to Iwatani-sama periodically, until they stop misbehaving."<br/>
Naofumi:"Well……That’s obvious."<br/>
The queen also adds that there is always a shadow watching Bitch and Trash.<br/>
So if they do something bad then it will be reported immediately.<br/>
So each time Trash and Bitch does anything, I can choose to reward or torment.<br/>
They can even show me what’s happening. This sounds very pleasant.<br/>
Queen:"Yes. So please think about the extent of their punishment. Surely they will do it again. Since all attempts will be prevented beforehand, punish them accordingly, since Iwatani-sama presence is necessary to help Melromarc.<br/>
Naofumi:"……I understand"<br/>
The queen then declares grandly to all the visitors that have gathered.<br/>
Queen:"I, Mirelia Q Melromarc, would like to thank everyone here for participating in this event. Everybody, please enjoy the feast and have fun!"<br/>
The participants who gathered in the hall cheered, and my reason for participating in this event is completely different from last time.<br/>
Last time I participated for the money.<br/>
I understand that the country’s situation will become a lot harsher in the future.<br/>
Firo:"Wow~……"<br/>
Firo’s eyes shine at the amount of food put on display.<br/>
This party seems to be a restaurant style buffet.<br/>
Everything is in placed like a luxurious restaurant for the important guests.<br/>
If you still want to eat more, just head to the buffet and get a refill.<br/>
We were guided to our designated table with our plates full.<br/>
Last time we just stayed in a corner and ate.<br/>
Naofumi:"You may go get more food after you finish that plate."<br/>
Firo:"Really!?"<br/>
Naofumi:"There is a rule. You must maintain your human form."<br/>
Firo:"Okay!"<br/>
After devouring the expensive cuisine in front of her, Firo begins to skip towards the buffet looking for more.<br/>
For Firo is it quantity over quality?<br/>
Somehow, Firo’s attitude reminds me of how Raphtalia was before.<br/>
Incidentally, I look at Raphtalia.<br/>
Raphtalia:"Wh-What is it?"<br/>
Raphtalia spoke bashfully while I stared at her.<br/>
Naofumi:"Is that enough? When you’re done go get more."<br/>
Raphtalia:"I do not eat so much anymore!"<br/>
Naofumi:"……It’s bad for your health. Even during forced marching, replenishing your body’s nutrients is important."<br/>
Raphtalia:"……Haah……"<br/>
Raphtalia sighs deeply.<br/>
Did I say something wrong?<br/>
Raphtalia:"Uhm……Naofumi-sama what kind of girls do you prefer?"<br/>
Naofumi:"What?"<br/>
There isn’t really any kind of girl I particularly prefer……..<br/>
I would like to avoid such a topic since it makes me recall Bitch.<br/>
Raphtalia:"Err……In your original world, did you have someone you liked?"<br/>
Naofumi:" What are you saying? There is no such person."<br/>
That is not my reason of wanting to return to my former world. Why would she think that?<br/>
Raphtali:"……Haah……"<br/>
Raphtalia sighs again.<br/>
Naofumi:" I don’t really understand your questions, but I am only returning because I want to go home."<br/>
After everything is concluded I will not hesitate to return to my original world. But if I had to look for a reason……<br/>
Then, suddenly I recall when I first arrived in this world.<br/>
Is my wish to return coming from the fact that I was deceived by Bitch?<br/>
These feelings, after recognizing them again seem to have become stronger.<br/>
Mysterious Voice:"Hero of the Shield-sama!"<br/>
Naofumi:"Hm?"<br/>
When I turn to the direction of the voice, a volunteer who I recognized is heading towards us.<br/>
Ah, these two, one of them was the one that asked for a signature.<br/>
Naofumi:"I’m glad to see you safe."<br/>
SoldierA:"You have nothing to worry about……That’s not it."<br/>
I look at the soldier who received the signature.<br/>
Naofumi:"Were the clothes that I signed stolen? It’s my fault."<br/>
The soldier shakes his head.<br/>
SoldierB:"It’s all right."<br/>
Naofumi:"I see, if it’s fine then I won’t worry. So how did the signature get stolen? What happened?"<br/>
It seems to be the work of a group from the extremist country.<br/>
He got caught up in this unfortunate event.<br/>
Naofumi:"Can’t be helped. Extend your hand."<br/>
SoldierB:"Yes?"<br/>
It’s not the best thing I can give, but it can’t have an actual form.<br/>
I shake hands with the soldier who wanted the signature.<br/>
SoldierB:"Ah……"<br/>
I wonder what the standards for handshakes in this world are. It would be bad if this was rude.<br/>
Naofumi:"I apologize for troubling you. I am grateful for your co-operation given the circumstances. Forgive me with this for now."<br/>
SoldierB:"……Okay!"<br/>
The soldier nods very joyfully. His cheeks are dyed red……<br/>
This child is probably one who believes in the Four Saints Faith or the Shield Religion. That’s probably why he wanted my signature.<br/>
……I hope some dangerous guys don’t want the hand that I shook.<br/>
Was this too rash?<br/>
Naofumi:"If there is an opportunity I’ll thank you properly."<br/>
Soldiers:""Okay!""<br/>
Just when I was about to speak.<br/>
Mysterious Voice:"Naofumi!"<br/>
Naofumi:"Hm?"<br/>
Motoyasu walks towards me while fuming.<br/>
……Haah.<br/>
Soldiers who realized the situation rushes to stop Motoyasu.<br/>
Soldiers:"Please wait!"<br/>
Motoyasu:"Out of the way!"<br/>
The soldiers were knocked away and Motoyasu continued on.<br/>
Motoyasu:"……Let’s duel!"<br/>
Naofumi:" What’s with you suddenly?"<br/>
Do you suffer an illness that forces you to fight me at every feast?<br/>
Motoyasu:" I heard about it! That you changed Mein’s name selfishly!"<br/>
……Haah. Were you seduced by Bitch?<br/>
Bitch is clinging to Motoyasu while crying.<br/>
Bitch:"Hero of the Shield-sama selfishly asked mama to change my name without my permission……"<br/>
Her acting isn’t very good.<br/>
Hm? Looking carefully, Bitch’s equipment is different from before.<br/>
All her luxurious equipment is gone, all that’s left are cheap products.<br/>
Oh, was her equipment seized by the queen?<br/>
Well that’s a shame!<br/>
Motoyasu:"Why are you acting so childish?"<br/>
Naofumi:"Hahahaha!"<br/>
Motoyasu:"It’s not funny! Such a pitiful name!"<br/>
Naofumi:"I know right!?"<br/>
This is the consequence of Bitch’s deeds.<br/>
I mean Bitch was carried to the hospital earlier as a result of her actions.<br/>
Motoyasu:"If I win, you will change her name back."<br/>
Naofumi:"I’ve already beat you–"<br/>
Motoyasu:"This time is different."<br/>
Naofumi:"……I guess so. You are that kind of guy."<br/>
I have no reason for fighting at all.<br/>
I’m also getting a bad feeling……<br/>
The crowd parts and the queen walks in.<br/>
Motoyasu:"Queen-sama! Please grant a duel between Naofumi and I!"<br/>
Motoyasu seems to think the queen would allow such an the duel just as Trash did.<br/>
Queen:"I will not."<br/>
Motoyasu:"Eh?"<br/>
Motoyasu expresses his surprise and seems flabbergasted by the queen’s words.<br/>
