Okay, it’s finally over. I guess the moral of the story is that people can change. Oh yes, this one contains some MAJOR spoilers,so be prepared as you read. A nice ending for a side story<br/>
THE CHRISTMAS OF THE SHIELD HERO CONCLUSION<br/>
The flying sled is on a coarse set for Melomark Castle.<br/>
"Wow… how unexpected." (Queen) (TL: Note, not dead)<br/>
Trash and the Queen are on the Castle’s terrace. They seemed to have set up a romantic aura.<br/>
I guess even Royalty spends Christmas like this.<br/>
I feel bad for ruining the mood and turn to leave, but they call me back.<br/>
"I’m sorry for bothering you so late at night." (Naofumi)<br/>
"Were you distributing presents to the villagers?" (Queen)<br/>
"Well, I had almost finished, but there someone who wished to corrupt the holy night, and…" (Naofumi)<br/>
"I see…" (Trash)<br/>
Trash nods with a knowing face. Well, his perceptiveness is his only good quality.<br/>
He had guessed the situation from looking at our faces.<br/>
"We’ll return by portal in a little bit." (Naofumi)<br/>
"No, no, take your time. Melty is already asleep, but you can at least look at her sleeping face." (Trash)<br/>
"Ah. I understand." (Naofumi)<br/>
Trash has changed a lot from back then. For some reason, he is trying to get me and Melty together.<br/>
"That’s right Iwatani, take your time." (Queen)<br/>
The queen also receives us warmly.<br/>
"Do you plan to give Melty a Christmas Present?" (Trash)<br/>
What is this person saying.<br/>
I have no idea what sort of present to give her.<br/>
"Wait, Aren’t you, Trash, more fit to play the role of Santa for her?" (Naofumi)<br/>
I mean, he has a beard and he’s around the correct age.<br/>
It seems he will look good in a Santa Suit.<br/>
"Your worry is undue." (Trash)<br/>
"I’m saying it’s ironic. Don’t salute me!" (Naofumi)<br/>
I don’t really feel like dealing with Trash.<br/>
"And I’m not brash enough to take away the joy of a parent giving their daughter a present." (Naofumi)<br/>
"Well then, we have prepared a present to give her, so why don’t you and my husband put it by her pillow together?" (Queen)<br/>
The Queen starts nudging Trash as if she had said a good idea.<br/>
It was a terrible idea.<br/>
And why do I have to help give it anyways?<br/>
"Firo wants to give Melty a present too." (Firo)<br/>
"……" (Naofumi)<br/>
Perfect. This bird can go give Melty a Present, and I can make my leave.<br/>
I’ll leave this one to Firo.<br/>
"Wait. Master~?" (Firo)<br/>
The queen effectively seals off Firo’s movements with a ribbon.<br/>
The Queen lifts up Firo, and begins to carry her off.<br/>
"Ok, Trash, you go give your present with that Hero. I’ll prepare my own present." (Queen)<br/>
"Eh?!" (Firo)<br/>
Firo is looking to me for help.<br/>
I didn’t see anything.<br/>
"su~……." (Melty)<br/>
She’s sleeping quite peacefully.  But if I make a wrong move and wake her up, it will be troublesome.<br/>
She works quite hard for her age.<br/>
I lightly stroke her forehead, and leave the box along with the Queen’s present.<br/>
"See you Firo. Play nicely with Melty" (Naofumi)<br/>
"Yes!" (Firo)<br/>
"Okay, let’s go, Trash." (Naofumi)<br/>
"Iwatani, why don’t you sleep with them as well" (Trash)<br/>
"Surely you jest" (Naofumi)<br/>
Why do I have to sleep with Melty?<br/>
I can imagine what sort of face she will make when she gets up<br/>
"But if Iwatani doesn’t sleep in the same bed as Melty, what meaning does Christmas hold?" (Trash)<br/>
…Trash. It seems he has no plans of backing off.<br/>
Ku…Even here, there are people trying to corrupt my holy night.<br/>
But you have made some grave errors on your calculations.<br/>
Those would be the fact that I am a Hero that holds special power, and the fact that Rafu is here.<br/>
"Rafu!" (Naofumi)<br/>
"What are you doing, Iwatani?" (Trash)<br/>
I suddenly take out Rafu, who had been hiding. Trash is speechless.<br/>
"If you go any further, then your princess just might wake up…" (Naofumi)<br/>
"GU…" (Trash)<br/>
I stare at Trash in silence.<br/>
I don’t know if he gave up, but Trash left the room.<br/>
… or not.<br/>
"If you say that much, I will give up for now, but next time… I will have other plans." (Trash)<br/>
…As expected of a king. This much isn’t enough to make him give up.<br/>
"See ya, Firo" (Naofumi)<br/>
"Cya, Good Night!" (Firo)<br/>
Me and Rafu went outside, and used the Portal to return home.<br/>
(TL: It’s a bit late, but this seems to be the equivalent of Teleport, Warp, Mr. Gency, Return Door, you get the point)<br/>
"Ah… I’m tired." (Naofumi)<br/>
Rafu and I, who had warped back to my house, sit down and sigh.<br/>
Sadina? She was drunk and collapsed at the village entrance.<br/>
I look to the sky, and wonder if she’ll be okay… No, she’ll be just fine, let’s leave her be.<br/>
I mean, she’s really, REALLY strong against the cold.<br/>
"Good work." (Rafatalia)<br/>
The door to my room opens, and Rafatalia comes out.<br/>
"You should go to sleep. Santa won’t visit you." (Naofumi)<br/>
I have the last few present inside of my sack.<br/>
I planned to put one by Rafatalia’s pillow, but…<br/>
"Of course I know Santa isn’t real, Naofumi was doing Santa’s role this year, correct?" (Rafatalia)<br/>
"Say what?" (Naofumi)<br/>
"There’s no way I wouldn’t know" (Rafatalia)<br/>
"Hmm… That’s true, but I still hoped you hadn’t figured it out." (Naofumi)<br/>
I wanted Rafatalia to remain as a dream-filled child.<br/>
Like Female Knight.<br/>
"Your actual age is quite low, isn’t it? Act your age, dream more." (Naofumi)<br/>
"What sort of logic is that…" (Rafatalia)<br/>
"Rafu~" (Rafu)<br/>
"Oh I have one for you too, Rafu" (Naofumi)<br/>
I take out Rafu’s present from the sack and hand it to him.<br/>
By the way, Firo’s present was the dinner and the task of delivering presents in itself.<br/>
Rafu didn’t really want anything, so I arbitrarily picked something out for him.<br/>
"Rafu~!" (Rafu)<br/>
Rafu, who had already opened his present, was admiring the Plush animal I had made of him.<br/>
Yes, Pets should behave cutely like this.<br/>
"And for Rafatalia is this." (Naofumi)<br/>
And with that I have given away the last present.<br/>
Inside is clothing. I thought Rafatalia would look good in Japanese clothes, so I had them made.<br/>
I had placed the order a long time ago, but this and that happened, so I was only able to pick them up recently.<br/>
Which is why I am presenting them to her now.<br/>
"Ah, thank you" (Rafatalia)<br/>
"Then, should we go to sleep?" (Naofumi)<br/>
"What about you?" (Rafatalia)<br/>
"Me? Why would I give a present to myself?" (Naofumi)<br/>
"I see… then…" (Rafatalia)<br/>
And Rafatalia hands me two boxes.<br/>
The first one is quite big.<br/>
"This is…?" (Naofumi)<br/>
"It’s a present from everyone, and a present from me." (Rafatalia)<br/>
The big one contained a letter, and materials used to repair and upgrade equipment<br/>
I guess the villagers had noticed. Recently my equipment had been getting worn down, and I was divided on whether or not to send them in for repairs.<br/>
The letter contained words of thanks towards me.<br/>
As for Rafatalia’s… It’s a plush doll of Rafatalia and me. It is the perfect scale to go as a set with Rafu’s plushy.<br/>
"Thank you very-." (Naofumi)<br/>
I honestly thanked her.<br/>
Before I noticed it I had spoken my mind.  I force a smile<br/>
"Now then, Let us go to sleep. There’s still the Christmas present I have to prepare for tomorrow."<br/>
It’s the monster’s requests of ‘Play with me’  that I still have to fulfill.<br/>
"Okay." (Rafatalia)<br/>
"Rafu~!" (Rafu)<br/>
"Tonight is cold, so let’s sleep together" (Naofumi) (TL: ( ° ͜ʖ ͡°))<br/>
"Y-yes!" (Rafatalia)<br/>
"However, we won’t be corrupting this holy night, or the perverted women will take me away." (Naofumi)<br/>
(TL: I think the other women have come to agreement to be second in line.)<br/>
…<br/>
…?<br/>
When I get up, I find something on my pillow.<br/>
I start to get up to check its identity.<br/>
Lying there is a present I don’t remember seeing when I went to sleep.<br/>
Who could it be from?<br/>
I look inside to make sure it isn’t a present I forgot to deliver.<br/>
Inside is a single photograph.<br/>
It’s a photo of my former world. I am in the center and around me are Rafatalia, Atlas, my family and my old friends.<br/>
It’s quite a lively scene.<br/>
There aren’t many people who would be able to obtain such an item<br/>
For me to be able to make this sort of face… I guess this a present from myself.<br/>
It’s probably from the me in that world to the me in this world.<br/>
It looks like I’m having fun over there as well.<br/>
It’s not like I have any intentions of returning<br/>
I had long thrown away such ambitions.<br/>
"Niichan, Niichan!" (Kiel)<br/>
I hear the sound of the children running around with their new toys.<br/>
That’s right, right now I’m living a happy enough life that the me over there would be jealous.<br/>
Is what I think as I get out of bed.<br/>
