Chapter 55.2 : Labyrinth City, Labyrinthos<br/>
Lightly toasted bread seems to be the staple food in this world. It’s made with cereal flour and water, without any yeast! It’s not like this world doesn’t have yeast. In fact, the bread found in Japan is sold in Holy Republic Lenaria. It’s just that the bread here is toasted for preservation.<br/>
Usually, they stuff meat and vegetables between the burger and then eat it. To think I could enjoy a burger-like food in this world too. I put cheese and vegetables in mine. The cheese here is made with the milk from the goat raised on the 5th floor.<br/>
Since they have a giant rock salt deposit on the 5th floor, there’s no need to worry about the salt either. But I don’t know where they get their fresh water from.<br/>
「It’s useless… I can’t find the secret passage leads to the outside world.」<br/>
I told everyone about our investigation’s results during lunch.<br/>
「Is that so? Well, I guess we’re quite unlucky, Chiyuki. What shall we do now, Reiji-sama~」<br/>
Euria hugged him as she called out to him with a coquettish voice.<br/>

Rino and Nao’s face darkened. Even Sahoko didn’t seem happy about the situation.<br/>
「Euria-san, can you stop acting so clingy while we’re having a serious discussion? 」<br/>
I glared at Euria, but she didn’t budge an inch.<br/>
She tightened her embrace around Reiji. Euria was caught by the minotaurs two days ago when she was chasing Reiji through the labyrinth and was brought to this place. For some reason, she’s living in this temple and seems like she’s immensely enjoying this situation too. She doesn’t seem the least bit bothered about her missing mother.<br/>
On top of that, the maid with her seemed out of place as well. Just like Euria, she doesn’t seem to be bothered about this situation. The two of them are living here as if they were born here. But, we’re grateful for their hospitality since they’re taking care of our meals, baths, housing etc. However, don’t they feel anxious about the current situation?<br/>
「Well, it’s fine, Chiyuki. Let’s just take our time.」<br/>
Reiji spoke as he bit into the apple-like fruit.<br/>
「Wait a minute, Reiji-kun! Just how long are you planning to stay here?! 」<br/>

I shouted in rage, but despite my outburst, Reiji continued to smile gently.<br/>
「It’s okay, Chiyuki. The minotaurs won’t just sit back and watch the situation. They’ll definitely do something about it, so let’s just wait until then. Moreover, Shirone and Kaya are still out there. They’ll do something about our situation.」<br/>
Like always, he’s not bothered about our situation. I heaved a sigh. Why is he acting like a big shot? To be honest, I’m disturbed by this whole situation. I’m sure every sane person would feel the same way as well. But it seems like I’m the only who even cares about it. It’s not just Euria and company, even Rino, Nao and Sahoko seem unperturbed.<br/>
Looking at this way, it seems I’m the only one fussing over it. Everyone else trusts Reiji, or maybe they think it’s fine to stay imprisoned as long as they can stay by Reiji’s side. I’m sure Sahoko feels this way.<br/>
Even though I’ve only known her for a short time, I’m sure Euria’s the same as Sahoko. Even in such a situation, she can manage to act carefree.<br/>
As for me, I don’t have that much faith in Reiji. Even if the other girls don’t care, I do. It’s been 5 days since we’ve been trapped in this labyrinth. Just what will become of us?<br/>
I rested my head on the dining table.<br/>
「Chiyuki.」<br/>
A voice whispered in my ears. I turned around to see Reiji standing beside me.<br/>
「It’ll be fine, Chiyuki. Trust me. Believe in Shirone and the others.」<br/>
Reiji shortened the distance between us. My heart raced as his beautiful face came close to me. How could this be? The only thing good about this man is his face. But were it not for his philandering, I would’ve fallen in love with him.<br/>
Reiji’s eyes were unusually serious. As his face got closer, I repeatedly told myself about how his face was the only good thing about him.<br/>
Ah! I can’t let this continue any longer!! My mind began to reason with itself.<br/>
「I’m fine, Reiji-kun! Something good just happened, after all!! 」<br/>
I gently pushed him away. Phew… He almost had me there. Begone, you evil male!<br/>
Even though I’m not anxious, my heart’s still beating loudly. But when I looked at Reiji, he was still grinning. This guy really is…<br/>
「Well, now that Chiyuki’s become cheerful again, shall we go to a picnic tomorrow? It seems that it doesn’t rain here, and it’d help the others feel better too.」<br/>
「 I agreeee~」<br/>
Rino happily said yes to Reiji’s suggestion.<br/>
The 5th floor’s extremely wide. It even has a hill and a lake with flowers growing all around it. The light produced by the crystal is just enough to enjoy a warm picnic too.<br/>
「I’ll prepare a lunchbox then. Help me with it, Nao-chan.」<br/>
「Roger, Sahoko- san~」<br/>
Sahoko and Nao enthusiastically went along with the plan, but I could see them look at me from the corner of my eye. Looks like Reiji isn’t the only one worried about my condition. Well, it’s not like feeling down will do us any good either… So I decided to cheer up.<br/>
「Let me to help you too, Sahoko-san.」<br/>
「Thank you very much, Chiyuki-san.」<br/>
Sahoko smiled at me sweetly. It was that famous saint smile of hers. It’s capable of healing the heart of anyone who sees it, including me.<br/>
Ah, I really shouldn’t stay in a slump like this. Just because there’s nothing we can do for now, I shouldn’t give up. I need to be strong.<br/>
「Hehe, it’s been a while since I’ve had food cooked by Chiyuki. I can’t wait to taste it again!」<br/>
Reiji was trying to make fun of my cooking.<br/>
「Don’t get your hopes up. It’s far from Sahoko’s level, after all.」<br/>
I glared at him.<br/>
「Sahoko’s cooking is something that I never get enough of!」<br/>
To mock my cooking like this… Hmph, guess I’ll make his portion super bitter!<br/>
「Reiji-sama~ Can I go with you too?」<br/>
「Of course, Euria. You can come along as well.」<br/>
「Thank you very much, Reiji-sama!!」<br/>
Eura jumped to hug Reiji again. All the other girls, including me, grimaced as we watched her act so frivolously.<br/>
Well, unless something grave happens, it looks like we’ll be going for a picnic tomorrow. I feel bad for Shirone and the others who were left behind, but this is better than being depressed.<br/>
And so, we continued having lunch.<br/>
◆Death God, Zarxis<br/>
「What’s the meaning of this, Labrys?! Why the hell are you not giving me the hero and his comrades?! 」<br/>
I yelled at Labrys who was sitting on his throne on the 13th floor of the labyrinth.<br/>
「What are you talking about, Zarxis? When did I promise that I’d give the hero to you? The one who captured him is my daughter, Euria. So it’s up to her what to do with him.」<br/>
Labrys simply laughed at me.<br/>
「GUGUGU!」<br/>
I couldn’t do anything but grumble over this matter. His daughter’s the one who trapped the hero of light in the labyrinth. The bastard’s daughter is even monitoring their movements. We’re prepared to react immediately when and if she reports any anomaly in the hero’s party. Indeed her achievement is great.<br/>
But the barrier Labrys used to seal the 5th floor was originally mine! It’s my barrier that’s keeping them in there! Moreover, I’m the one who helped him rebuild his underground palace and yet, this ungrateful bastard is…<br/>
However, opposing Labrys in this place isn’t a good idea.<br/>
「Then… Give me the hero’s women.」<br/>
「 No. Although they’re nothing in front of Rena, these women are beautiful. I refuse to hand them over to you.」<br/>
He refused my request again. Ah, he’s laughing at me!<br/>
「But Labyrs, what are you going to do is Rena doesn’t come? Even though you claim that you’ll let your daughter choose the hero’s fate, do you really have no intention to kill him?」<br/>
That’s the one thing I’m worried about. Although Labrys came up with this plot to lure Rena out of Elios by using the hero as a bait, I don’t think he took Rena’s suitors in Elios into his calculation. Could it be that he hadn’t even considered a case in which Rena doesn’t make it in time?<br/>
「Of course, then I’m going to behead that shitty hero and send his head to Elios. I’ll make her understand what it means to refuse the invitation of this great Labrys.」<br/>
Ah, what a typical answer for him.<br/>
「And what about your daughter?」<br/>
The girl called Euria or whatever her name is should be his most favoured daughter, or favourite pet, to be exact, just like the half-naked Queen of Pashipea lying by his side. Labrys is the shadow ruler of several human kingdoms in the Minon plain, Pashipea kingdom being one of them. I heard that the Queen of Pashipea was presented to him by her own father when she was just a princess.<br/>
「Why would I need to worry about Euria? This was all to lure Rena into coming here. If she turns out to be useless, I can just replace her with another woman.」<br/>
The queen’s body twitched as soon as she heard Labrys’ words. It seems she’s aware that she’ll be killed once Labrys gets his hands on Rena. Nevertheless, Labrys’ daughters doesn’t look like she knows that. Her egotistical nature is similar to her father. Although the daughter seems to love her father a lot, I can’t feel any semblance of love or affection for her from the father. In a way, she’s just like those minotaurs.<br/>
