"Naofumi, you dense Motherfucker"<br/>
-Motoyasu<br/>
Chapter 213: Nap<br/>
After returning to the village, I took a light nap.<br/>
Because of Firo’s misconduct, I have forbid her from coming into my bed.<br/>
In order to keep up the Atlas countermeasures, I invited Melty over, but…<br/>
"W-w-why do I have to sleep with Naofumi!?" (Melty)<br/>
"Originally, it was Firo’s duty, but as she caused quite an uproar, she has been banished as a punishment." (Naofumi)<br/>
I asked Rat for the reason for her suddenly going to heat.<br/>
She said it may be because I slept next to her so much.<br/>
Something about… Being attached to me, or something.<br/>
I have no idea what she’s trying to say.<br/>
I have no intentions of setting up house in this world.<br/>
Building a Harem in another world?<br/>
I threw away such dreams long ago.<br/>
"And so her successor is you, Melty. I thought I would leave her duties to you. Despite what I say, you’re pretty strong. You should be able to drive Atlas out." (Naofumi)<br/>
"I don’t want to!" (Melty)<br/>
Melty’s face is dyed a deep shade of red.<br/>
But of course.<br/>
I did sacrifice her to halt Firo’s movement…<br/>
"I see. You hate it that much. Then there’s no helping it." (Naofumi)<br/>
"Eh… ah, wait." (Melty)<br/>
"I was in the wrong." (Naofumi)<br/>
"Ah… Yeah…" (Melty)<br/>
What? Melty is making a strange expression as she hesitantly lowers her extended hand before leaving.<br/>
Now then, I have to find another tribute.<br/>
Besides Melty, is there someone else in this village who can fight on par with Atlas?<br/>
"Hero-sama, I’ve come to deliver your requested equipment." (Imya)<br/>
At that moment, Imya came with the peddling clothing I ordered.<br/>
Kiel and the others have good faces, so I thought of making them wear nostalgic Maid outfits, or some clothes that have niche audiences when they go out peddling.<br/>
The reception was quite good, and earnings increased.<br/>
"Faaaa…" (Imya)<br/>
Imya hands the clothing over as she stifles a yawn. Did she stay up all night making these?<br/>
Fumu… If she’s sleepy, then her timing is good.<br/>
My Atlas troubles are common knowledge in the village.<br/>
She should understand.<br/>
I’m worried whether or not she will be able to drive Atlas out, but there’s no one else here, so there’s no choice.<br/>
"Now then, Imya." (Naofumi)<br/>
"What could it be?" (Imya)<br/>
"Won’t you sleep with me?" (Naofumi)<br/>
"EEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEH!?" (Imya)<br/>
After pausing for a few seconds, Imya lets out a loud voice, and falls over.<br/>
"Oy, what are you so surprised about?" (Naofumi)<br/>
"M-my heart isn’t ready…" (Imya)<br/>
"What do you mean? It’s just sleeping." (Naofumi)<br/>
"And I’m… dirty…" (Imya)<br/>
What is she saying? I stare at Imya.<br/>
I don’t get the dirty feeling I got from Raphtalia when I bought her. Just from looking her, I see she has put a bit of attention into personal hygiene.<br/>
The Raphtalia from back then hadn’t bathed in weeks. Though I don’t know why my mind is comparing them.<br/>
"Don’t mind it." (Naofumi)<br/>
"I can’t!" (Imya)<br/>
"I’m also sleepy, so hurry and come to the bed." (Naofumi)<br/>
"A…ah… Yes." (Imya)<br/>
Imya is shaking. Am I really that scary?<br/>
But if she’s learned to remain vigilant, I guess that’s a good thing.<br/>
Why is she loosening her clothing?<br/>
A half-naked Imya shakes nervously as she approaches me. Why is she half-naked?<br/>
I don’t know what her customs are, but does she sleep half-naked?<br/>
Timidly, she lies down on my bed.<br/>
I put the covers over her and close my eyes, but Imya seems to be making pained sounds as she continues shivering.<br/>
As a Mole Demi-Human, are human Beds no good for her?<br/>
"What’s wrong? Calm down. You won’t be able to sleep like that." (Naofumi)<br/>
Maybe because I’ve been sleeping with Firo a lot, having something next to me when I sleep calms me down.<br/>
I no longer toss and turn from my trauma like before. I guess sleeping with Firo has been a good rehabilitation.<br/>
Oh? Imya’s body temperature is quite high. I lightly pat her head.<br/>
And Imya twitches violently.<br/>
"Hii!? Um… As I thought… It’s impossible for me! Sorry!" (Imya)<br/>
Imya says as she jumps up and runs out of the room.<br/>
"Oy. What happened to her?… O-y." (Naofumi)<br/>
Did she think I would try to make a move on her?<br/>
No, I don’t think she’s someone who would make that big of a misunderstanding. The fact that Firo sleeps with me as an Atlas countermeasure should be common knowledge here…<br/>
As I chase after Imya, I find her discussing something with Kiel. As soon as she sees me, she runs away again at an alarming speed.<br/>
Should I invite Kiel instead?<br/>
"Niichan! What are you doing!? Don’t you have no interest in women?" (Kiel)<br/>
Kiel acts rebelliously like she always does, but as soon as I get on the bed, she quiets down.<br/>
"Uu… Niichan. What do you plan on doing!?" (Kiel)<br/>
I pat dog form Kiel as I lie down.<br/>
Maybe because I’m used to stroking Firo’s feathers.<br/>
Perhaps that’s what lets me sleep easily with others.<br/>
In Puppy Mode, all of Kiel’s body is covered in fur. It’s similar and quite soothing. Though Imya would have been fine as well.<br/>
"Oh, if Atlas tries to come in, drive her out. Then I’ll be sleeping." (Naofumi)<br/>
"Ah, Niichan! What do you mean by that?" (Kiel)<br/>
"You’re being noisy. Quiet down." (Naofumi)<br/>
"I-I got it Nii-chan." (Kiel)<br/>
Following my orders, Kiel goes quiet, as she lies in the bed waiting for me to fall asleep.<br/>
"Niichan. Don’t cause so many misunderstandings… and don’t scare Imya-chan so much…" (Kiel)<br/>
"Ha? What are you talking about?" (Naofumi)<br/>
"… Niichan, is it true that you’re doing it with Atlas-chan and Firo-chan?" (Kiel)<br/>
"I don’t know what you’re misunderstanding, but there’s no way that’s true. Everyone should know, right?" (Naofumi)<br/>
"… First I’m hearing of it, Niichan." (Kiel)<br/>
"Is that so? I though Sadina passed on the information." (Naofumi)<br/>
"There’s no way Sadina Nee-chan would tell the truth about situations like this! She said that you would be aiming for me next!" (Kiel)<br/>
What is that whale telling these kids!?<br/>
There’s no way I would do such things.<br/>
"I did something bad to Imya. I’ll have to apologize later." (Naofumi)<br/>
"… I don’t think you have to worry about it. Imya-chan seemed happy." (Kiel)<br/>
With question marks floating above my head, I went to sleep.<br/>
By the way, Atlas did indeed come, and Kiel drove her off with her barking.<br/>
Amazing. Kiel is acting like a guard dog.<br/>
My evaluation of her has risen ever so slightly.<br/>
By the way, because of her barking, I couldn’t sleep well.<br/>
Anyways, after I woke up from my nap, it was the afternoon.<br/>
After distributing lunch to the slaves, I teleported to the castle.<br/>
Since Motoyasu surrendered, I have to tell the Queen.<br/>
If Firo continues manipulating him, he’ll probably help work towards world peace.<br/>
I also have to stop by the Old Man’s place to place in an order for a carriage.<br/>
When I appeared in the Castle, Trash was in front of me.<br/>
"…" (Naofumi)<br/>
"…" (Trash)<br/>
His clothes are quite normal today.<br/>
After silence ruled the area for a while… Trash turned and left.<br/>
After seeing Atlas, he’s gone quiet.<br/>
The Queen always comes here to greet me, so this time I go to her office.<br/>
"If it isn’t Iwatani-sama. How are you doing?" (Queen)<br/>
"You know why I’m here, right?" (Naofumi)<br/>
"Yes, it’s about the Hero of the Spear, right?" (Queen)<br/>
"Yeah. Did he come here?" (Naofumi)<br/>
"… Early in the morning, he was standing in front of the castle, turning himself in… I went to see him after hearing the report, but he was a little… He wouldn’t listen to me, and I had to speak to him through a male interpreter." (Queen)<br/>
The queen uses a fan to cover her mouth as she glares at me.<br/>
I can understand her feelings. Recently, I’ve been starting to doubt whether or not his mind even has the capacity to accept logic.<br/>
He follows Firo’s words without question, but everything else is…<br/>
"This is all your daughter’s fault." (Naofumi)<br/>
"I’m aware. But this change was mostly brought about by Iwatani-sama’s pet bird, correct?" (Queen)<br/>
I can’t deny it, but when you say it like that…<br/>
"So? What are you going to do with Motoyasu’s sentencing?" (Naofumi)<br/>
"As you’ve probably assumed, we’re not going to press further punishment as long as he participates in the wave. Though the individual has also honestly admitted to being a bandit in the mountains." (Queen)<br/>
The Queen’s avoiding eye contact.<br/>
It seems evident that she’s hiding something.<br/>
Or perhaps she’s signaling for me to deduce it myself.<br/>
She probably had a hard time dealing with Motoyasu.<br/>
"And? What did he do?" (Naofumi)<br/>
"Ah, did you understand what I meant?" (Queen)<br/>
"You avoided eye contact to make me understand, right?" (Naofumi)<br/>
"I’m thankful for Iwatani-sama’s deductive ability…" (Queen)<br/>
"Just get on with it." (Naofumi)<br/>
"Then let me report. The individual in question demanded that he be punished, but we kept trying to tell him that we had no intention of doing so. He refused to pull back, so we told him attaining world peace was to be his punishment." (Queen)<br/>
That’s a bit much, I told the Queen.<br/>
Well, it’s not like he’s repenting anything. He probably just wants to show Firo that he’s starting over for her sake.<br/>
"After that, how should I say this. Up until that point, things proceeded relatively smoothly, but after that, the Hero of the Spear began to take increasingly troublesome action regarding the Filo Rials within the castle…" (Queen)<br/>
"Ha?" (Naofumi)<br/>
<br/>
