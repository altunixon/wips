There are some words you need to understand to understand Otaku Culture The word used for the title is Otoko no Ko, or the English Equivalent, Trap.<br/>
<br/>
Chapter 220:  Trap<br/>
(TL: The one that warrants Hououin Kyouma going, ‘Daga Otoko’ in the background. Not the Admiral Akbar type.)<br/>
Eventually night falls, and I invite Ren and Motoyasu to my house. I want to see how earnestly they’ve been studying.<br/>
I used this country’s language to make up a test.<br/>
Though I don’t know why the study hating me is acting like a teacher.<br/>
… Well the past few days have been pretty much like this.<br/>
Though Motoyasu starts today.<br/>
"Motoyaasu, if you’re here to play with Filo Rials, then leave!" (Naofumi)<br/>
Motoyasu pats his Filo Rial followers as he looks over the questions.<br/>
"You can’t! If I don’t have them, how do you expect me to study in this room that stinks of pigs!?" (Motoyasu)<br/>
"… *Sigh" (Naofumi)<br/>
According to Motoyasu, my entire village stinks of Pigs, and he can’t stand being in it.<br/>
The only way he can handle it is if he’s surrounded by Filo Rials.<br/>
I ignore Motoyasu and go check over Ren’s work.<br/>
"There are a few grammatical errors, but it seems you’ve gotten a grasp of the language." (Naofumi)<br/>
"That’s because Naofumi diligently teaches me every night." (Ren)<br/>
He learning quite fast, while I took quite a while.<br/>
Of course learning from a chart is much easier than learning from scratch.<br/>
It was really difficult for me, who only ever managed to get average scores in English.<br/>
Learning a new language will always be quite tough.<br/>
Though it was an essential for my life, so I have been able to become quite fluent in it.<br/>
"So, Motoyasu, how are you doing?" (Naofumi)<br/>
I look at Motoyasu’s paper.<br/>
… His scores are higher than anticipated.<br/>
They’re just elementary problems, but he has around 80% correct.<br/>
He was quite a Realer (TL: Riaju) in his own world. He may be smarter than me.<br/>
I don’t know why such a man got hooked on Net Games, but it seems that it is no longer possible to get such information from the individual, and I don’t really want to.<br/>
"All is for Firo-tan. I am working hard." (Motoyasu)<br/>
"… I see." (Naofumi)<br/>
So he’s learning fast because they’re the letters of Firo’s world.<br/>
I guess this is what they call the determination of an idiot.<br/>
It seems that he’s highly motivated.<br/>
"Do you understand why I’m having you learn the letters of this world?" (Naofumi)<br/>
"… To help in your peddling?" (Ren)<br/>
After thinking for a while, Ren answers.<br/>
If he had said ‘In order to learn magic’, then I would have stopped his lessons. I guess he gets passing marks.<br/>
It may be an essential skill to learn magic, but if he answered as such, that would mean that he was still lusting for power as he had been before.<br/>
"That’s also a reason. Though I’m not sure if you’re saying your true opinion." (Naofumi)<br/>
He seems to have some desire to save the world. I’ll leave it at that.<br/>
I understand that I’m acting stuck up. But originally, this is a skill he should have picked up on his own.<br/>
He should be grateful that I’m even teaching him.<br/>
"Well, Ren’s been busy with his sword training recently, so should we end studies here?" (Naofumi)<br/>
"About that…" (Ren)<br/>
"Hm?" (Naofumi)<br/>
Ren doesn’t make eye contact. He stumbles over his words.<br/>
"Could I, like Naofumi… Be given a job?" (Ren)<br/>
He seems to be trying hard as not to be put under suspicion.  He looks straight at me and stops talking.<br/>
It seems… He is motivated at least.<br/>
Though I don’t know his prowess.<br/>
"A job… Do you mean like my compounding?" (Naofumi)<br/>
"Since I’ve come to this village, I’ve heard that Naofumi’s been doing a lot. Cooking, and compounding, making accessories, and even dabbling in alchemy. That’s why I… want to learn to do something." (Ren)<br/>
"My dream is to become a Filo Rial herder." (Motoyasu)<br/>
"Motoyasu, be quiet for a second." (Ren)<br/>
I see… So Ren has gotten an interest in manufacturing.<br/>
Ah, is that why he’s been so earnest in learning the sword?<br/>
As he’s a Hero, if he unlocks the required weapons, then he should be able to gain manufacturing skills like mine.<br/>
If he really wants to, I don’t see why I shouldn’t…<br/>
"I see your enthusiasm. So you want to become a person who makes things." (Naofumi)<br/>
Because of the Curse of Greed, Ren can’t touch money, and his monster drops are all bad.<br/>
I think it will take a month to recover. Though when coupled with Gluttony, I don’t know.<br/>
It’s only been a week and a half since he’s gotten here, so it’ll be a while.<br/>
"T-that’s true… but when I see this village’s children, I get the feeling that I can’t continue doing nothing." (Ren)<br/>
"Fumu…" (Naofumi)<br/>
I see where he’s coming from.<br/>
A majority of the villagers are good with their hands. They make goods to be peddled.<br/>
So he got such an impression.<br/>
"When your curse lessens, I’ll leave it to you." (Naofumi)<br/>
"Got it." (Ren)<br/>
… Doesn’t the Onsen at Cal Mira have Curse reducing effects?<br/>
Though you can’t do anything else while recuperating.<br/>
I remember my curse, which was supposed to take a month, being dispelled faster while I was there.<br/>
Though I used Blutopfer again shortly afterwards, so my stats fell again.<br/>
Since we have a teleportation skill, I should probably look into it.<br/>
Should I go check it out tonight… Even though it’s for treatment purposes, it sounds a little fun.<br/>
Can the other heroes warp there?<br/>
Though the island isn’t really far or anything.<br/>
"Hey, can either of you warp to Cal Mira Island?" (Naofumi)<br/>
"Hm? Ah, it’s a place I haven’t set. The Island Activation prevented teleportation skills." (Ren)<br/>
"How about now?" (Naofumi)<br/>
"It’s the off season. We won’t know unless we try." (Ren)<br/>
Then it might not be so bad to visit for the onsens.<br/>
I’ll send the nuisance Motoyasu away to check it out, and wait for his return.<br/>
I can leave it to Ren as well.<br/>
I wonder if Heroes are able to teleport each other.<br/>
"The next thing I need to ask is whether or not Heroes can teleport each other if they’re in the same party." (Naofumi)<br/>
"That is… I never tried so I don’t know." (Ren)<br/>
I guess I’ll have to experiment.<br/>
I’ll try teleporting somewhere with Motoyasu later.<br/>
"Mo-kun, are you still studying~?" (Filo Rial)<br/>
"I am, Marin-chan. I need to work hard to get Father-in-Law to approve of my marriage." (Motoyasu)<br/>
"Muuuu!" (Filo Rials)<br/>
Upon hearing that, Red and Green punch him simultaneously.<br/>
By the way, I wouldn’t let them in my house unless they took on human form.<br/>
They made the same promise as Firo.<br/>
If they break it, I have punishment in store.<br/>
"Marin-chan?" (Ren)<br/>
"Don’t get involved, Ren." (Naofumi)<br/>
"Well, I’m not really sure, but having a conversation partner is important, right? That’s what I’ve been thinking recently." (Ren)<br/>
So he’s speaking from experience.<br/>
It’s not like he’s wrong, but he should consider who he’s speaking to.<br/>
Motoyasu’s a landmine. You should steer clear of him.<br/>
"I’m glad you asked!" (Motoyasu)<br/>
Motoyasu’s eyes sparkles as he loudly proclaims this.<br/>
Ah, you stirred up the hornet’s nest.<br/>
Motoyasu joyfully proceeds into a speech I have no interest in.<br/>
"First, this Red child’s name is Kuu-chan. The origin of this is Crimson. Next, the Blue one’s name is Marin-chan. Her name comes from Aquamarine. Finally, we have Midori. Her name is just as it sounds." (Motoyasu)<br/>
(TL: Crimson = Kurimuson, so Ku. Aquamarine = Akuamarin. Green = Midori)<br/>
"Nice to meet you!" (Filo Rials)<br/>
The three quickly lower their heads.<br/>
But their eyes are different when they look at me than when they look at Ren.<br/>
These birds…<br/>
Including Witch, Motoyasu always had three women tagging along with him. Even when he became a pervert, he still continued to be surrounded by women.<br/>
But it seems that this time they actually like him.<br/>
"I-is that so?" (Ren)<br/>
"Motoyasu-san, is this how it’s done?" (Midori)<br/>
Midori picks up Motoyasu’s question sheet, and starts doodling all over it.<br/>
Now that I take a closer look, she got all the answers correct.<br/>
Was she cheating?<br/>
No, I was watching over Motoyasu when he filled it out, so that shouldn’t be the case.<br/>
"Midori, you’re smart." (Motoyasu)<br/>
"Mu!" (Marin and Ku)<br/>
Red and Blue let out discontent voices.<br/>
They each seem to have different personalities… but I don’t care.<br/>
"Ehehe…" (Midori)<br/>
The emerald colored one seems to be the smart one of the group.<br/>
"Ah right. That one doesn’t fight in monster form, right?" (Noafumi)<br/>
"Yeah, she says that angel form is easier." (Motoyasu)<br/>
"I see…" (Naofumi)<br/>
I see the other two’s monster forms all the time, but I’ve never seen the emerald one.<br/>
Hm?<br/>
Does a ranking system exist among these three…?<br/>
The red one seems a little cold.<br/>
Is it my imagination?<br/>
I do hate red. I can’t help but associate it with that woman.<br/>
I get the feeling that red things are strong-willed.<br/>
"It’s because my legs aren’t as powerful as Kuu or Marin." (Midori) (TL: Uses Boku)<br/>
"I see…" (Naofumi)<br/>
So she’s of a Filo Rial race that isn’t good at kicks?<br/>
Yet in human form, she wields a heavy-looking battle axe.<br/>
I might look into this.<br/>
It seems that there are many types of Filo Rial.<br/>
"Instead, Midori is good at identifying poisons, medicines and other things." (Motoyasu)<br/>
"I see." (Naofumi)<br/>
"Master has mean eyes, and is worse at interaction than Motoyasu-san. But don’t worry, I won’t hold it against you." (Midori)<br/>
"What was that!?" (Naofumi)<br/>
Firo has been wishing to spit poison for a long time.<br/>
This one is toxic in another way… But I won’t say that.<br/>
"It’s something a child said. Don’t mind it Father-in-Law." (Motoyasu)<br/>
"I mind it. Send her out! A mouth like that will bring disaster." (Naofumi)<br/>
"I see… I’m sorry Midori, please go home." (Motoyasu)<br/>
"Y-you can’t! Motoyasu-san! Let me back in! As I thought, I’m…" (Midori)<br/>
Motoyasu swiftly transports the emerald one outside of the room.<br/>
Amazing! Are my orders truly absolute?<br/>
It’s not like I’ll order to him to kill or anything.<br/>
but it’s good that he knows who’s boss.<br/>
"There’s… something off." (Ren)<br/>
Ren looks over that exchange with a strange look on his face.<br/>
He seems to have caught onto something.<br/>
"Ah, Midori is the only male among the first angels that hatched. Could that be it?" (Motoyasu)<br/>
