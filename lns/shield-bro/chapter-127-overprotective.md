<br/>
Laptop returned from fixing. I might even appear again within a year. Also decided to start including honorifics at times.<br/>
 <br/>
Overprotective<br/>
「Uuu……heavy」<br/>
I remember this feeling.<br/>
I open my eyes and check the surroundings.<br/>
Looks like I was put to sleep in the healing house’s bed.<br/>
When I look I see Firo is sleeping while leaning on me, and Raphtalia fell asleep while sitting in a chair.<br/>
This is still fine, but for some reason even Melty is sleeping with Firo.<br/>
Again huh. When I use Blutopfer it always ends up like this.<br/>
「Ah, you regained consciousness！」<br/>
Rishia just came into my sick room carrying a water bottle.<br/>
Unusually she’s not wearing the costume.<br/>
Thinking about it Rishia looked like this didn’t she.<br/>
She’s always wearing the Firo costume so I forgot.<br/>
「Raphtalia-san, please wake up. The hero of the shield regained consciousness」<br/>
With a sway Rishia shakes Raphtalia.<br/>
While watching that I checked my condition.<br/>
There don’t seem to be any wounds. The healing house’s people probably dealt with the curse too.<br/>
But, the lethargy following my body around nearly makes my eyes spin.<br/>
As expected, the stat reductions are having quite an effect.<br/>
「You guys！　Heavy！」<br/>
I moved Firo and Melty and got up.<br/>
「Nnya？」<br/>
「Ah, Naofumi-sama！　You woke up！」<br/>
「Yeah, I must’ve worried you」<br/>
「Of course I was worried！　Truly, you were so unreasonable」<br/>
I ignore Raphtalia’s grumpy scolding and look at Rishia.<br/>
If I obediently listened to this from the beginning the sun will set after all.<br/>
「What’s the situation？」<br/>
「Are you listening！？」<br/>
If I say no she’ll probably get angry…….<br/>
Well, I am not listening though.<br/>
But there’s no reason to start a quarrel.<br/>
「I’m properly listening. There’s a lot of other stuff I want to know」<br/>
「Eeeeto…one day’s passed since then」<br/>
One day……When I released Blutopfer before it took 2 days so it’s pretty fast.<br/>
As usual my condition’s bad, but it’s the kind of thing you get used to.<br/>
「The queen ordered your treatment to be of the utmost priority」<br/>
Which means, it’s probably safe to think I received expensive magical and herbal treatment.<br/>
There wasn’t even a place to give treatment in the castle town before.<br/>
「What happened to that turtle？」<br/>
「It’s life ended right before Melromarc was going to take casualties」<br/>
「I see」<br/>
While I was unconscious, it’s good it didn’t revive or something. It seems that method was right.<br/>
「Right now, they’re in the middle of disposing of the remains」<br/>
「Understood. By the way」<br/>
「Nn……」<br/>
「Why is Melty here？」<br/>
「Etto, Princess Melty heard the hero of the shield was seriously wounded and――」<br/>
「Wa, wa, waーーーー！」<br/>
Melty, who just woke up, yells in a loud voice to make Rishia, whose eyes are glittering, shut up.<br/>
Just what kind of situation is this.<br/>
Just as before, Melty still has a hysteric part to her.<br/>
「While I was still sleepy just what kind of made-up stuff were you trying to say！」<br/>
「I, I’m extremely sorry！」<br/>
Aah, when dealing with a princess Rishia is also unable to act strong.<br/>
Raphtalia and Firo are used to it after all. Rather she seems to dislike stiff attitudes.<br/>
「Then Melty, I’m already fine, so return to the castle」<br/>
「Is that the way you talk to someone who came to visit you worried！？」<br/>
「Oh, that’s right.  While you’re at it call the queen. There’s a mountain load of things I want to ask her after all.」<br/>
「In the end it’s that！？　I got it already！」<br/>
Melty storms out at a pace unthinkable for a princess.<br/>
And then right after turning around, she stuck her tongue out and taunted me.<br/>
Like a child. No, she is a child.<br/>
Isn’t it an action fitting for her age.<br/>
「Just what are you laughing for. Stupid Naofumi！」<br/>
「Wait Melty-chan！　You sure do talk the talk. Your Lordship」<br/>
「Follow her and come back」<br/>
「Yeah」<br/>
Firo followed after Melty and left.<br/>
「Then……」<br/>
The noisy person disappeared.<br/>
However, even then there’s no need to stay on my side forever.<br/>
I get up from the bed and stand.<br/>
「Are you fine? Resting a bit longer would be……」<br/>
「The injuries are already healed so it’s stamina only. Right now I want to check the situation for myself」<br/>
I check the status.<br/>
……Uwaa. There’s only 30% of before I lost consciousness. My defense staying unchanged is the only relief.<br/>
While dragging my heavy body, I look outside from the healing room.<br/>
……I can see a shell as big as a mountain range is blocking out the sun.<br/>
Other than that, I can see guys doing repairs.<br/>
Losses ended up heavy.  On the other hand, if it hadn’t been stopped there the castle would’ve been destroyed.<br/>
……That’s right. The wave is coming in 2 days.<br/>
Preparations need to be made.<br/>
With that thought, I focus on the hourglass floating in my vision to measure the exact time.<br/>
Huh？<br/>
The red hourglass’ number is still frozen.<br/>
And then, I’m able to confirm that the blue hourglass’ icon is still moving.<br/>
……Etto。<br/>
The number is 8？<br/>
I have a really bad feeling.<br/>
Just in case I check.<br/>
This time the remaining time in the blue hourglass is displayed.<br/>
Roughly……3 and a half months？<br/>
What’s happening?<br/>
If this is the time until the next wave, or alternatively, some seal dissolves then……it’s quite long.<br/>
No, if it’s preparations to fight a monster that caused that level of damage then it’s short?<br/>
I don’t know.<br/>
「Excuse me」<br/>
When I turn to the voice the queen enters the room.<br/>
Behind the queen there’s also the Allies’ top brass.<br/>
「How does your body’s condition seem to be？」<br/>
「Not that good」<br/>
「I have come with a message from an expert healer. You will need at the fastest 3 months to recover. Also even if you go with house rest, he wants that move to be prohibited until full recovery」<br/>
「Even if you say that, if I hadn’t used it the castle and town would’ve been annihilated」<br/>
「……I understand. Regardless, it’s the healer house’s healers’ appraisal that if you end up having to use it before you recover, you’ll definitely die」<br/>
「I see……」<br/>
There’s that large of a risk？　Well, even I knew it took a large toll.<br/>
To be honest, it’s not like I used it because I wanted to, and if I can avoid having to use it I’d prefer it as well.<br/>
「I got it. As expected I won’t use it」<br/>
I don’t want to use a skill that damages me anyway. From now on I’ll avoid using Blutopfer.<br/>
「Then, how about the repairs？」<br/>
「Yes, we took heavy damage, and the disposal of the upside-down turtle is holding us up」<br/>
「Can that thing even be disposed of？」<br/>
What can I say, it’s currently as if an actual mountain came to the castle.<br/>
「Right……According to the investigation squad’s analysis rather than dispose it’s better to leave it」<br/>
「That’s about right. It seems disposal is more getting rid of perishables such as the meat」<br/>
「Yes」<br/>
It’s true the disposal of that mountain-like monster’s body will be problematic.<br/>
However leaving it to rot until it spreads diseases would be a true problem.<br/>
「Currently, we’re in the middle of butchering the meat」<br/>
「Are you collecting the familiars and materials？」<br/>
「Yeah, the kind of things Iwatani-sama would want were in advance」<br/>
That saved me.<br/>
There’s the soul eater shield’s example.<br/>
The turtle’s shield will be really strong. Probably.<br/>
It seems’s I’ll also be able to absorb its heart and familiars.<br/>
「The rest I think I’ll explain at the castle」<br/>
「Aah……By the way it’s about the hourglass but」<br/>
「I know about that matter as well」<br/>
There were 2 days, so preparations are already finished by now it seems.<br/>
It’s really helpful the explanation’s fast.<br/>
「Then, guess I’ll go」<br/>
「Wouldn’t it be better to rest a bit more……」<br/>
says Raphtalia, who is worrying about my body.<br/>
I understand the feelings, but there are some stuff I might do at the very least.<br/>
It’s best to rest my body only after I’ve dealt with the troublesome stuff.<br/>
「No, either way I only have to talk. Since I’m only tired there’s no problem」<br/>
「……I understand. But no matter what don’t overdo it, okay?」<br/>
「Yeah yeah」<br/>
It’s true I’m exhausted, but not to the point that I’ll die. I’d prefer if I wasn’t treated like an invalid……。<br/>
Was Raphtalia always this overprotective？<br/>
