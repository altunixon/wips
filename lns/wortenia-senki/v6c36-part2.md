<br/><br/>
In fact, if you call me to such a place and say that the work is no big deal, no one will believe that.<br/>
“What?”<br/>
　It is suspicious and Douglas asks that question.<br/>
　There is no human beings who will believe such suspicious story.<br/>
Normally, you would have kicked down a chair and jumped out of the room a long time ago.<br/>
The fact that he still doesn’t stand means that Douglas understands his position well.<br/>
　There are two reasons why Douglas does not stand up.<br/>
　One is the fact that he was taken to this room by the hands of his colleagues.<br/>
　And the other is the suspicion that Ryoma Mikoshiba may be involved in the whereabouts of Douglas’ family who suddenly disappeared.<br/>
　And Ryoma also had a conversation taking into account Douglas’s thoughts.<br/>
(Well, it’s not good to be too impatient … Is it about time to get into the main subject?)<br/>
　It seems that Douglas fully understands his position, so Ryoma cuts to the main subject.<br/>
“Well, that’s not a big deal. I just want Mr. Douglas to open the back gate to the House of Lords.”<br/>
　Douglas instinctively tilts his head after hearing Ryoma’s words.<br/>
“The back gate … does that mean that back gate that opens in an emergency?”<br/>
“Yeah, that gate.”<br/>
　Upon hearing the words, Douglas closes his mouth and shuts up.<br/>
　And he just kept staring at the face of the young aristocrat sitting in front of him.<br/>
　The back gate is usually tightly closed.<br/>
　No, it was a fact that the number of people who knew its existence was limited.<br/>
　Because this back gate leads from the House of Lords to the North Gate, which is one of the shortest routes out of the walls of the royal city of Piraeus.<br/>
　It is provided as one of the escape routes in case of an emergency.<br/>
(Does this man know the existence of the back gate … I heard that he is a well-prepared man …)<br/>
　Douglas felt that his unpleasant premonition was getting bigger and bigger.<br/>
　The back gate itself is made smaller to avoid the public eye.<br/>
　Also, since the drawbridge is always up, soldiers are not on duty like the main gate.<br/>
　There is only a lookout in the turret on the wall.<br/>
　However, like the main gate, it is protected by a water moat, the gate is made of iron, and the surrounding walls are also made of stone.<br/>
　If you don’t bring a siege engine to forcibly break through the wall, you won’t be able to break the wall at all.<br/>
　Even if they are attacked from the outside, they are prepared enough to withstand attacks until reinforcements arrive.<br/>
　It is true that there are fewer resident guard soldiers than the main gate, but this is because not a lot of people know about the back gates.<br/>
　However, instead of having a small number of people, the soldiers who protect this back gate are the best in the House of Lords.<br/>
Of course, to open this gate, it will require a certain procedure.<br/>
However, Douglas knows that it is only a building.<br/>
In reality, if someone with a certain power orders the gate to be opened, it will be opened easily. <br/>
　And if you’re a relative of the Count Hamilton, who ranks third in the House of Lords, it’s not difficult to force him to open the gates.<br/>
(Well, can it be opened? It is not impossible to open. At least, if I go and order the soldiers to open, it will be enough…………)<br/>
　The problem is Douglas’s current position.<br/>
　It’s not a big deal if you were a relative of the Count Hamilton, but it’s doubtful that Douglas, who had been taken to a colleague’s bailiff as a sinner, would have any influence. <br/>
(Besides, how are you going to open the back gate? I don’t think so.……)<br/>
　It is possible that Ryoma Mikoshiba is planning to escape from this House of Lords.<br/>
　But that doesn’t seem to make much sense.<br/>
(If you escaped safely from the royal capital, then what? Are you going to stay in the Walthenia Peninsula?)<br/>
　It is true that Ryoma Mikoshiba overthrew the Count Salzberg and his followers in the previous battle and took control of the northern part of the Kingdom of Roselia.<br/>
　However, it is only a temporary occupation.<br/>
　Many war-torn territories would never help the new lord who caused the war.<br/>
　If a conquest army carrying the Roselia royal crest was dispatched to the territory of his own, the conquered territories would definitely rebel against Ryoma Mikoshiba.<br/>
　The only way to get out of this situation is to surrender or commit suicide.<br/>
(Or, he can become a commoner, and throw everything away and escapes …?)　<br/>
　Douglas thinks that the only reason to use the back gate is to escape from the House of Lords. There is no other reason to use it.<br/>
　However, with Douglas’s doubts, Ryoma just smiles calmly.　<br/>
　Then gradually opens his mouth.<br/>
“How is it, Mr. Douglas. Can you accept it?”<br/>
“May I decline …?”<br/>
　Douglas makes a self-deprecating laugh.<br/>
　However, Ryoma gives up on Douglas.<br/>
“I will not force you.”<br/>
　Ryoma erased his smiling face.<br/>
　Then, turn his cold-lighted eyes straight toward Douglas.<br/>
“But if you accept it, the reward will be boosted. And unlike you, we will not break the promise we made.”<br/>
　That said, Ryoma received a wooden box from Laura standing behind him and placed it on his desk.<br/>
　Then gradually open the lid of the box.<br/>
　At that moment, Douglas realized everything. Emergency<br/>
