… Retyped the entire thing…<br/>
<br/>
Chapter 262: Lab Visit<br/>
Noon, that day.<br/>
I head to Rat’s lab to see her progress.<br/>
Atlas and Sadina went with Fohl to raise their levels.<br/>
I have no idea why Sadina’s joining. Are they going to be training in the sea?<br/>
"So this is the equipment you procured from that facility you found while we were fighting in the Castle Town?" (Raphtalia)<br/>
I managed to obtain various magic tools and machines, as well as many large test tubes.<br/>
Rat, Taniko, the village’s more intelligent slaves, and researchers from the castle are in the middle of setting them up.<br/>
"Yeah. In order to overcome the wave, we have to make use of whatever we can get." (Naofumi)<br/>
Raphtalia absentmindedly pokes an empty test tube.<br/>
The Granny is currently giving basic training to everyone in the village who wants to fight.<br/>
She’s looking for people to send on her Spartan Training session.<br/>
The Loinclothed Dog is also a candidate.<br/>
Though if she goes, I would be troubled.<br/>
Despite how she acts, she helps bring together the slaves and acts as a sort of leader.<br/>
But since Raphtalia’s back, I think we’ll manage one way or another.<br/>
And that doesn’t really matter right now.<br/>
Right now, I’m here to ask Rat about her progress.<br/>
The only thing I’ve personally asked her to do is the Bioplant research. I think it would be fine if she took on other projects as well.<br/>
There are jobs that need to be done, and I estimate that Rat’s research will prove useful soon.<br/>
"Ara? Count… no, was it Marquis now? What’s up?" (Rat)<br/>
Rat is facing a giant petri dish and tapping on what appears to be a stone tablet.<br/>
Is that supposed to be a computer?<br/>
Rat puts her work on hold and addresses me.<br/>
"It’s a regular inspection. So has anything happened?" (Naofumi)<br/>
"Let’s see… We’re in the middle of tuning the new equipment you got." (Rat)<br/>
Inside of the dish, Rat’s favorite monster is swimming around. It waves its hand at me.<br/>
When I return the wave, it gives a happy expression and begins spinning in circles.<br/>
"Can you do something about that monster?" (Naofumi)<br/>
"Right now, it’s still uncertain. I can’t complete that child’s body yet." (Rat)<br/>
"I see." (Naofumi)<br/>
Based on her actions, we may get a powerful fighting force. My expectations are high.<br/>
But there’s the chance that she may trigger a Biological Disaster, so I still want to manage her actions.<br/>
In this instance… would it be a Magical Disaster? Or perhaps an Alchemic Disaster?<br/>
But Rat seems to be the type who takes care in her research. Maybe my worries are unfounded.<br/>
She’s tending to the Bioplant matter with great care.<br/>
Though I can instantly make vague modifications, if I leave the fine tuning to Rat, it takes a while.<br/>
"I told you that I looked through the report on replicating Legendary Weapons, right?" (Rat)<br/>
"Yeah" (Naofumi)<br/>
She said something about it not being worth it.<br/>
"Does that mean that making growing weapons will prove impossible?" (Naofumi)<br/>
"That’s not the case. I think I’ll be able to do something about that one." (Rat)<br/>
"Specifically?" (Naofumi)<br/>
"It’s incomplete, but could you look at this?" (Rat)<br/>
Rat strikes the tablet with her index finger, and a single blue display pops up.<br/>
An item is displayed on it in 3D.<br/>
From what I see, it looks like a carriage.<br/>
But… it somehow seems alive. Is it an insect…?<br/>
"What is that?" (Naofumi)<br/>
"As you can see, it’s a Carriage-type monster." (Rat)<br/>
"Hah?" (Naofumi)<br/>
"It’s still in the planning stages, but in order to make a weapon that grows… no, more specifically, a monster in the shape of a weapon, I’ll need to start large and go down from there. This is trial number 1." (Rat)<br/>
Um… That means that she’s going to make an artificial Carriage and downsize from there?<br/>
The problem is whether this thing can move on its own.<br/>
Will one of my Filo Rials be pulling it?<br/>
I get the feeling Firo would hate it.<br/>
With it being a monster, can you even put people in it?<br/>
It’s scary that it looks like it’ll eat anyone who sits in it.<br/>
"What will it be able to do?" (Naofumi)<br/>
"Magical Support and some other miscellaneous options. You can attach a crane to let it lift and bind enemies as well, I think." (Rat)<br/>
"Fumu… Can it function as a normal carriage?" (Naofumi)<br/>
"That’s what I’m looking into right now. I don’t think it will be capable of self-propulsion, so it’s only a prototype. If it doesn’t go well, I might just scrap it." (Rat)<br/>
"I see." (Naofumi)<br/>
I guess making something like this would require prototyping.<br/>
Though Rat may seem a little strange, I knew that when I hired her.<br/>
"If that succeeds, this is next." (Rat)<br/>
And, what appears on the display is the Firo Plushy I gave to Rishia.<br/>
Various additions and augmentations are scribbled all over it.<br/>
"The only thing I see here is a costume. Is that just me?" (Naofumi)<br/>
"Nonono. It’s a Costume-type Monster." (Rat)<br/>
"Is that so…" (Naofumi)<br/>
Rat hits the tablet again, and the Firo Plushy on the screen begins moving.<br/>
It looks like the actual Firo running.<br/>
"The problem is that you have way too many Filo Rials, so I question whether this one will actually be necessary. It may just be a long, unneeded detour towards my goal." (Rat)<br/>
Yeah, that’s true.<br/>
But the concept is interesting. It’s an armor that levels.<br/>
Ah, right. My Barbarian Armor also got something called Growing Power.<br/>
Though I have no idea what it’s supposed to do.<br/>
"If that also turns into a success, I’m moving onto weapons, but that seems to be a bit far away." (Rat)<br/>
"Got it. It’s good enough that you have a concrete plan." (Naofumi)<br/>
"… You’re not going to speak of heresy? You’re not going to reject me? That’s surprising." (Rat)<br/>
"What are you saying at this point in time? Is your conscience finally acting up? I’m not from this world, so I don’t care about you guys’ sense of morals." (Naofumi)<br/>
And even though I look like this, I was a complete Otaku before I got here.<br/>
I’ve read plenty of manga and played plenty of games with psychopathic scientist characters.<br/>
This one is much saner than I expected.<br/>
More importantly, she’ll definitely add to our fighting force.<br/>
If the Carriage-type monster goes well, we might be able to upgrade to a self-propelling car.<br/>
No… if all goes well, we may get a giant mobile Robot. But that might be going too far.<br/>
We should stay away from Sci-fi stuff in this fantasy world.<br/>
It’s nice to be able to dream of something besides combat ability.<br/>
The growing Costume-type monster is the same.<br/>
Instead of constantly mending and replacing armor, we may be able to grow the strongest equipment.<br/>
"All of these concepts are intriguing. You don’t need to set growing weapons as your end goal. There are plenty more possibilities here." (Naofumi)<br/>
"… This is the first time the Marquis has supported me to this extent." (Rat)<br/>
"If you have time to give thanks, then go get some results." (Naofumi)<br/>
"As expected of the Marquis." (Rat)<br/>
"Shut it. Let’s get to work already… Ah, would the Bioplants be a good base for the Carriage? We could try making a plant-based trial product." (Naofumi)<br/>
"Interesting." (Rat)<br/>
As I offer suggestions, I feel Raphtalia fidgeting behind me.<br/>
"You’re having quite an amazing conversation there." (Raphtalia)<br/>
"There’s nothing amazing about it. Ideas like these are born of the imagination." (Naofumi)<br/>
There’s no way to attain progress without an insatiable thirst for knowledge and an ample amount of dreams.<br/>
Common sense rarely gives way to change.<br/>
In my world, the system of slavery became obsolete, but in this one, it’s a fact of life.<br/>
If you cared for what everyone else thought, you would never get where you truly wanted.<br/>
"And? When will your precious partner’s body be completed?" (Naofumi)<br/>
Rat’s goal is probably related to strengthening that monster. Her entire career may even hinge on it.<br/>
"If I just wanted to bring him into the outside world, I could make a Homunculus body, but that won’t make him strong. That’s why I want to make a sort of replaceable… this may sound weird coming from me, but I want to give him a body with a system like that of the Dragon Emperor cores." (Rat)<br/>
"I see. Homunculus… is it?" (Naofumi)<br/>
She wants to make her partner out of the best materials possible.<br/>
And because she trusts her partner will answer to her good will, Rat continues researching.<br/>
Even if the body turns out to be a failure, she could merely switch it out… If she made a system like the Dragon Emperor’s core stones, she could just switch its soul between bodies.<br/>
Gaelion’s a good example.<br/>
The True Gaelion lives within the child one. If they want to switch, they can.<br/>
Though, it seems there’s a time limit for switching.<br/>
Perhaps Rat wants to make her partner an emperor.<br/>
"Well, while you’re at it, make sure to take care of my requests as well." (Naofumi)<br/>
"… It’s not like I can defy the Marquis." (Rat)<br/>
With a delicate expression, Rat scratches her head and nods.<br/>
"Now that you mention it, about dragon cores…" (Raphtalia)<br/>
Raphtalia lifts the bag that was hanging on her waist.<br/>
"What?" (Naofumi)<br/>
"Ah, yes. While I was out training with Master, we went Dragon Hunting. I brought these back as a souvenir. I heard they were valuable, so I kept them and sent the other items to the storage house." (Raphtalia)<br/>
Raphtalia presents the contents of the bag.<br/>
Inside was a large quantity of dragon cores.<br/>
One. Two. Three… Anyways, there’s a lot.<br/>
Just how much did she fight?<br/>
And what’s dragon hunting supposed to be?<br/>
"Then let me call Gaelion over." (Naofumi)<br/>
And so, I called over Gaelion, who was conveniently in the area.<br/>
"Fumu. This is quite the amount of cores." (Gaelion)<br/>
"It spoke-!" (Raphtalia)<br/>
Watching Gaelion dig through the bag, Raphtalia raises her voice.<br/>
Ah, I never told her.<br/>
And during the Wrath Dragon incident, Gaelion refused to say a word.<br/>
"Yeah, Gaelion can talk. Remember when we fought the Zombie Dragon? That was this guy when it was still alive." (Naofumi)<br/>
"A-alive…? Just how did he come back to life then?" (Raphtalia)<br/>
I give a vague explanation of Gaelion’s situation.<br/>
Even Raphtalia seems quite shocked.<br/>
"With this amount, I’ll get quite a bit of strength." (Gaelion)<br/>
Core stones are like doping items to dragons. I guess they’ll prove useful.<br/>
It’s quite a nice souvenir. And there are more surprises to be found in the storage house, apparently.<br/>
I’ll look through them with Imya’s uncle and get him to forge some weapons and armor.<br/>
"A nice ratio of them are Dragon Emperor Fragments at that. That’s a life saver." (Gaelion)<br/>
Gaelion empties the bag into his mouth and gulps them down at once.<br/>
"Those would have sold for a lot. You should treat them better." (Naofumi)<br/>
"Hmph, in exchange, I’ll get stronger for you, so avert your eyes to this one." (Gaelion)<br/>
This wimpy dragon… The only thing big about him is his talk.<br/>
Gaelion’s scales begin to glow faintly.<br/>
"Fumu… I see. I see." (Gaelion)<br/>
"Did you remember something?" (Naofumi)<br/>
It would be nice if he finally obtained the knowledge on how to break the level 100 cap.<br/>
"Unfortunately, the information you’re looking for was not in these fragments." (Gaelion)<br/>
(ED: Your princess is in another castle!)<br/>
"Dammit!" (Naofumi)<br/>
The information we get is random, and I’m not getting anything useful.<br/>
"However…" (Gaelion)<br/>
"However?" (Naofumi)<br/>
"I learned that only Heroes can achieve the level above Dreifach, Revelation." (Gaelion)<br/>
"I know!" (Naofumi)<br/>
Why. Why is it that I only get information I already know?<br/>
But I’ll need to learn how to invoke it easier, so I won’t call this information completely useless.<br/>
"Also, the previous four heroes, and the ones before that, though they were able to survive the wave, they were unable to win against it." (Gaelion)<br/>
Hmm? They survived, but they lost?<br/>
What does that mean? I thought beating the wave meant surviving against it.<br/>
Is it like winning the battle but losing the war?<br/>
The wave’s identity remains a mystery.<br/>
"… The four must definitely not be killed… otherwise, overcoming the wave will become exceedingly difficult. It may even be impossible for the Seven Stars. Also, this wave is the last one. If you fail, the world is done for." (Gaelion)<br/>
The last one… he probably doesn’t mean the next battle, but the series of waves we were summoned for as a whole.<br/>
"And the Four Good Omens are…" (Gaelion)<br/>
(TL: They’re the Spirit Turtle, Houou… etc series, if you forgot)<br/>
"They are?" (Naofumi)<br/>
"I can’t remember any more. This is all I could get from the fragments." (Gaelion)<br/>
"I see. It was a little useful." (Naofumi)<br/>
I’m thankful for the information, even if it may be broken up.<br/>
I didn’t find what I wanted, but I cleared some things lingering over my head.<br/>
The problem is: what we have to do to win, or what must we do to lose?<br/>
Do we have to kill every single enemy summoned? Or is there another goal entirely?<br/>
Perhaps I’ll have to actively start gathering fragments.<br/>
"Also, the amount of people I can grant a special Class Up to has increased. If anyone wants to do one, I’m free at any time." (Gaelion)<br/>
"Got it." (Naofumi)<br/>
I unfasten the core of my Barbarian armor and hand it to Gaelion for renewal.<br/>
… The Armors stats rose by a questionable margin.<br/>
"Ah, right. Alchemist, you examined my body, did you not?" (Gaelion)<br/>
"That I did." (Rat)<br/>
"I’m also greedy for power. If you have the tools, I’ll permit you to modify my body at any time." (Gaelion)<br/>
"Taniko will get loud." (Naofumi)<br/>
"If it’s about Wyndia, you needn’t mind her. If I’m not strong, I won’t be able to protect what I must." (Gaelion)<br/>
"Rat was looking into the inheritance properties of dragons. Please tell her what you know." (Naofumi)<br/>
"Even if I try, it would be like my trying to explain how to breathe, you know?" (Gaelion)<br/>
Mu… Gaelion gives a troublesome reply.<br/>
I guess that would be difficult.<br/>
"Don’t worry, I’ll be looking into his body by myself. Perhaps I’ll add on some modifications while I’m at it." (Rat)<br/>
"Fufufu, first, I’ll need to get strong enough to take down the next Filo Rial Queen." (Gaelion)<br/>
Gaelion lets out an evil laugh. He seems to understand that he’s no match for his rival.<br/>
Well, like that, I ended my visit to Rat’s lab.<br/>
