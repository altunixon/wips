Intuition and analysis<br/>
I was amazed after hearing Raphtalia’s story.<br/>
Rather……It was expected.<br/>
So it’s like this. Spending the first day like a date.<br/>
Shopping at the market and visiting tourist spots, crossing the sea during a beautiful sunset.<br/>
At night, cooking home-made food, and drinking liquor at a bar.<br/>
Then, the next day, showing off and being cool while acting all handsome.<br/>
Tentatively, after approximately analysing their strength, he tries to steal my subordinates by trying to appear appealing to them.<br/>
Though it seems Raphtalia and Firo didn’t fall for it.<br/>
Naofumi:"How should I put it……"A toast to your eyes." you say, Is this the Showa Era?! Did you not have any lines that is a little more effective?"<br/>
Motoyasu:"In this world, all the older women were pleased with that……"<br/>
Ah, was it learnt from experience?……In any case, think about who your partner was.<br/>
Though it is probably my fault, Raphtalia was raised with efficiency as a principle. Those who show leadership will have a higher evaluation.<br/>
Firo:"The person with the spear complimented onee-chan a lot."<br/>
Naofumi:"I see……"<br/>
Raphtalia:"What did you come here to fight for? Did you come here to hit on girls?"<br/>
Raphtalia continues to attack the dejected Motoyasu.<br/>
Are you denying Motoyasu’s reason for existence?<br/>
Raphtalia:"If you do such a thing, when you encounter a formidable enemy , your companions won’t be able to help you!"<br/>
After declaring that, Raphtalia returned.<br/>
Raphtalia:"Is the next exchange tomorrow?"<br/>
Naofumi:"Ah, yeah……"<br/>
That’s amazing. To make Raphtalia this angry……<br/>
There was only one other time that I’ve seen Raphtalia this seriously angry.<br/>
It was during the results of the duel.<br/>
Well, that was Motoyasu’s fault as well; Motoyasu himself is mopping about over there.<br/>
Woman1:"That reminds me, where did Bitch and company go?"<br/>
Woman1 was listening to the story too? She was comforting Motoyasu with a hand on his shoulder.<br/>
Naofuimi:"Even though a day was wasted, experience still increased……"<br/>
Raphtalia:"Sorry……"<br/>
Naofumi:"No, that’s not what I mean Raphtalia."<br/>
When listening to the story during the activation, contrasting with her usual habit of composure, her voice is full of emotion.<br/>
Was it because of that, it has nothing to do with levels, but the chances of victory against the wave?<br/>
Hm?<br/>
Woman 1 came over to us and said.<br/>
Woman1:"Is that assassin still watching?"<br/>
Naofumi:"Probably."<br/>
Woman1:"Then I’ll supplement. Motoyasu-sama goes off and hunts alone at night.<br/>
Naofumi:"…………"<br/>
I think I just gave a very unpleasant look.<br/>
In other words, when Raphtalia……and the other girls were asleep, he was leveling up alone at night?<br/>
An image of a cool hard-working guy pops up, to make an effort in secret here, it seems a little strange.<br/>
Naofumi:"You think I have control of Shadow?"<br/>
Woman1:"Maybe."<br/>
Hmm, it isn’t a bad hand to present yourself stronger to your comrades.<br/>
Certainly, if this can be kept up, then some in-fighting could be avoided.<br/>
Above all, Motoyasu’s date plan needs to be investigated, but there isn’t enough time.<br/>
It’s not a bad hand, but it was Raphtalia that it was shown to.<br/>
That means this guy isn’t thinking about leveling. so he’s fooling around.<br/>
In the first place, the biggest drawback of this is.<br/>
His companions will not gain any levels, I can’t do that.<br/>
For me who can only use a shield to defend, a companion is essential.<br/>
Therefore, it is necessary to always take care of the conditions of your comrades.<br/>
There is also the fatigue of constant night battles accumulating.<br/>
Of course, it is also limited to hunting the demons that appear only at night.<br/>
Naofumi:"Oh right. Raphtalia"<br/>
Raphtalia:"What is it?"<br/>
We talk in whispers so that it won’t reach Motoyasu and them.<br/>
Naofumi:"How does Motoyasu fight?Is there something special you have to do, Like when fighting with me?"<br/>
Raphatalia:"Yup, the demons are not dismantled, the weapon isn’t changed…… The weapon absorbs the same way as Naofumi-sama’s."<br/>
Hmm……It feels like there are corners being cut.<br/>
So for that strength……Does Level mean everything?<br/>
There are those kinds of Net Games.<br/>
Raphtalia:"Though……He took a tool out of the spear."<br/>
Naofumi:"Tool? It wasn’t absorbed into the spear?"<br/>
Raphtalia:"Yup. It was different from a tool that was absorbed."<br/>
A tool from a spear……How was it done?<br/>
At last, a chance to get proper information has appeared.<br/>
Naofumi:"Motoyasu, There’s something I want to ask–"<br/>
The Motoyasu that should have been absent mindedly sitting there disappeared.<br/>
Woman 1 is also gone.<br/>
When I want to ask they are gone!<br/>
When did they disappear!?<br/>
Firo:"The person with the spear returned with that woman. They apologized to onee-chan."<br/>
Naofumi:"I-I see."<br/>
That’s quick…..I wanted some time to exchange information.<br/>
What Motoyasu does, may not be the same as Ren and Itsuki.<br/>
Well, there are a lot of disadvantages, but there are also many benefits.<br/>
In any case, the heroes like Motoyasu are just existences that are a lump of information.<br/>
Though during the activation, it’s only a matter of time before their secrets are exposed.<br/>
At least I learnt that Motoyasu has something that I don’t know.<br/>
Simply because there is a possibility, that Motoyasu is playing around to hide it.<br/>
If I was Motoyasu, I would refuse the staff exchange, and during the activation, work hard and level up.<br/>
It might be simple to turn down if I think about efficiency. However, I may only find out here.<br/>
Even if it’s just experience points, I’ll gulp it down like a beggar, I have a feeling those three know something different.<br/>
My intuition is telling me that it would be wrong to decline it.<br/>
There is something.<br/>
Those three heroes, without fail, are hiding something other than level.<br/>
Because if it’s just level, then it would be no different from adventurers.<br/>
This is supported by my knowledge and experience of Net Games up until now.<br/>
In Net Games there is something related to this event, and elements other than Level effect skills in real.<br/>
There is also the possession of rare items via financial power.<br/>
How many times have I encountered a person with only high Levels?<br/>
In a Net game, the administration makes equipment and rare items through trail and error that become important.<br/>
Levels are important at first, but later on it just becomes a comparison between acorns.<br/>
Therefore, the appearance of funds, organization strength, and rare items is required.<br/>
This world is not a game, but for some reason those three heroes still think that this is a game; I am curious.<br/>
It is common for activation events such as these to have a limit on Levels gained.<br/>
Beginner relief and Class Up promotions. Are job changes similar to a game?<br/>
In guilds, the members that have reached the level limit will help the new members in raising their levels.<br/>
Because Motoyasu was so laid-back, there was a similar feeling.<br/>
As far as he is concerned, his purpose is probably gathering information and looking for new companions right?<br/>
There is also a possibility of using the remaining six days after the exchange completed.<br/>
Otherwise, I cannot explain the composure of Motoyasu.<br/>
Ah……<br/>
Naofumi:"Shadow"<br/>
Shadow:"What degojaru?"<br/>
Naofumi:"Is there some kind of law during activation? Like rumors, theories, even something that has low credibility is alright."<br/>
Shadow:"……When I participated in the activation of Cal Mira Island, The experience worsens after Classing Up at level 80 degojaru. Of course, I entered more after that degojaruka, there is an upper limit to the inhabiting demons degojaru."<br/>
Right on the money huh.<br/>
In other words, those actions were in anticipation of that.<br/>
There is an upper limit……just like a game.<br/>
If I had the same gaming knowledge as those guys, I might have fallen under the illusion that this world is a game as well.<br/>
I can roughly grasp the level of their party by counting backwards from here.<br/>
Assuming the Hero is level 70-80, their companion should be between 40-70?<br/>
It is safe to assume that everyone can reach level 80 in at least a few days.<br/>
After that, it wouldn’t be so easy to gain when hunting. If there are demons on this island higher than 80, it would not be very delicious.<br/>
I know that in games, regardless of what, it is just a calculation.<br/>
Though I originally wanted to take my time with the hunting grounds during this activation, would it be better to look for shortcuts?<br/>
I feel like looking at a Walkthrough for net games.<br/>
However, the mystery has gotten even deeper.<br/>
In other words, taking Motoyasu as the lowest, Ren and itsuki should at least be around level 70.<br/>
Though, why are they equal to me when I use the Wrath Shield?<br/>
It is a fact that Wrath Shield is especially strong, but I am level 44. 20 levels lower than them.<br/>
Moreover, when fighting the pope, there was also an ability above him.<br/>
The mysteries don’t end.<br/>
While deliberating such thoughts deeply, and returning to the hotel, Motoyasu was forgotten about.<br/>
<br/>
