Chapter 49.2 : The Town of Freedom Fighter<br/>
◆ Freedom Fighter Girl, Shizufae<br/>
After we had escorted Atlan-san to the Ariadya Republic, I went back to Teseshia with Big Sis Keina. Once there, we reunited with our comrades at the designated restaurant.<br/>
「So that’s what happened, huh.」<br/>
「Yeah, that’s what happened, Leylia-san. The Hero of Light is soooo COOOOOOL!! 」<br/>
I gave my report to Leylia-san, our comrade.<br/>
She was a priestess of Rena around her mid-twenties. Leylia had the appearance of a gentle woman, but she could fight a demon by herself.<br/>
Leylia-san in her battle mode was extremely terrifying.<br/>

<br/>
As expected of a priestess of the Goddess of War.<br/>
When she was 20 years old, she heard the voice of an angel. Thus, she became an apostle and awakened her talent in healing magic.<br/>
The story of the Hero of Light loved by Goddess Rena was something she had to hear at all costs. While she heard the tales of the Hero Leylia-san couldn’t stop grinning.<br/>
Meanwhile, Madia sulked.<br/>
「Good job, Shizu-chan. If only I could go along with you…」<br/>
「It can’t be helped, Madia. You need to make regular appearances at the Magician association afterall.」<br/>
One of my childhood friends, Madia, loved those kinds of stories because we were all girls.<br/>
Madia was a magician. She was part of the Magician Association, and they ordered her to investigate the case of the runaway demons of the arena.<br/>
That was why she was unable to take the escort commission.<br/>
Since there was almost no reward in it, she wanted to refuse the Association’s request. Unfortunately, she didn’t have enough power to go against the Association’s wishes.<br/>
She kept grumbling nonsense since, even after an entire investigation, they found nothing.<br/>
「Yeah, he was really amazing! Both his face and his power! He is the type of man whose seed you want to have if you want to give birth to a child.」<br/>

「Wait right there, Big Sis Keyna!! That’s something you do only after you get married!! Remember, you’re Faeria-sama’s follower! 」<br/>
I reprimanded Big Sis Keyna. We were the followers of the Goddess of marriage Faeria-sama, the wife of the God Oudith.<br/>
According to her teachings, the act of making children was sacred. It wasn’t something that should be said so easily like a passing remark.<br/>
Big Sis Keyna was an abandoned child who was picked up by my father. Then, he entrusted her to Faeria Temple where my mother was working at.<br/>
Back then my mother and father had yet to marry, so I hadn’t been born yet.<br/>
I never knew who Big Sis Kenya’s parents were, but her father seemed to be a Centaur. Maybe that was why she was so broadminded.<br/>
I still remember the wrath of the priests whenever she said vulgar things.<br/>
Maybe the Centaur blood was the reason she was bigger than a normal human. Big Sis Kenya became a Freedom Fighter because it seemed the most natural path for her.<br/>
We all grew up in the same country. But that country was no more.<br/>
The survivors of that country were scattered around when the demon raid destroyed half of the rampart. Both my parents and I came to this country as refugees.<br/>

<br/>
<br/>
Both of Madia’s parents were magicians at that time. Even Big Sis Keyna, who I adored and who had been working at the same temple as my mother, also came to this country.<br/>
Thus, we were together again.<br/>
「Faeria followers must have it hard. In the case of the Elves, they’ll make a child with any man they’re pleased with.」<br/>
Nora, an Elf, said so as if to tease us.<br/>
「Nora-san. That might be the case for the Elves, but things aren’t that simple for humans.」<br/>
The tomboyish Nora-san was an Elf who had been banished from the forest. She committed a sin, so the other Elves sealed her power to commune with the spirits and sent her away.<br/>
She never told us what kind of crime she committed, but I couldn’t see her as a bad person. Her personality was too frank for it.<br/>
Not to mention, it was rude to be prying into someone’s past.<br/>
Despite being unable to commune with spirits, Nora-san was a bow master with senses that far surpassed that of a human. There was almost no ranger who could compete with her in Teseshia.<br/>
She and Leylia-san met in Teseshia and became close. While I and Big Sis Kenya were the warriors, Madia was the magician. Leylia-san was the priest, and Nora-san was the ranger.<br/>
There were others in our warrior group, but they were away for various reasons.<br/>
「By the way, Shizu-chan. Did you get the usual thing? 」<br/>
「Naturally.」<br/>

I took five wooden tags from my bosom pocket.<br/>
「I’ve properly booked the token of the theater.」<br/>
Everyone clapped their hands as they cheered in unison.<br/>
Atlan-san’s husband was the most famous merchant in the country, so his name was quite useful. And since he was acquainted with the opera troupe, I was given a discount when I bought the token.<br/>
Then, maybe because she was a woman like us, Atlan-san sent us around to do various jobs. I want to keep a long relationship with her.<br/>
This token was for the 「Alfaeria」 drama, which would be exhibited 5 days later. It was a story about a princess who set out on a journey. Her goal was to save the prince who was kidnapped by a witch.<br/>
The protagonist, Alfaeria, was a knight and a swordmaster on top of being a princess.<br/>
Actress Shenna, who played the princess knight, was the topic of our discussion. Her gallant act charmed even those of the same sex.<br/>
The drama was rated very highly among the young female audience. That must be why the token sold out immediately. So many people wanted to watch this drama.<br/>
We got the opportunity thanks to Atlan-sama.<br/>
「Now that we’ve got this token, what shall we do?」<br/>
「How about we go to the public bathhouse? I think it would be great for everyone to wash away their sweat together.」<br/>

<br/>
<br/>
Nora-san was an ardent lover of public bathhouses.<br/>
The Elves didn’t have the habit of bathing since they could clean their bodies with water spirits.<br/>
According to Nora-san, the only thing in which humans were vastly superior to Elves was bathing.<br/>
But I believed Nora-san loved public bathhouses so much for a completely different reason.<br/>
Nora-san was a lesbian. Thus, her love for public bathhouses was most likely because she could ogle other women’s bodies to her heart’s content.<br/>
And yet we agreed to go to the public bathhouse with her.<br/>
Although it was not as big as the one in Ariadya, Teseshia had its own public bathhouse. Perhaps it was built because a dirty body was a major problem for a female Freedom Fighter.<br/>
Once you left the rampart even dousing your body with cold water was a high hurdle. Some women didn’t concern themselves with such things, but the majority of them did.<br/>
Yesterday, when we arrived in Teseshia, we washed our bodies in our own rooms. I’d rather wash my body with hot water if the option was available.<br/>
Just as we were about to leave someone called out to us.<br/>
「Wait!! 」<br/>
A tall man walked towards us.<br/>
I knew him. His name was Godan, and he was the Hero of Earth. He was also the strongest man in Teseshia and the one in charge of maintaining the public order of the Freedom Fighter organization.<br/>
But, despite being called a Hero, many people didn’t want to get close to that violent man.<br/>
「Uhm… What’s the matter? 」<br/>
「You’re Shizufaeria, correct? 」<br/>
Godan asked as he looked at me.<br/>
「Yes, I am…」<br/>
「The Chairman called you. Come with me.」<br/>
I had a questioning look on my face.<br/>
The one Godan was talking about was Sneferu, the Chairman of the Freedom Fighter Association.<br/>
「Uhm… What kind of business could the Chairman have with me? 」<br/>
「An important commission. And he requested you.」<br/>
Gordon’s tone sounded threatening.<br/>
I couldn’t go against the Chairman’s orders. Doing so could end with us being chased from Teseshia and left to wander around on our own. It couldn’t be helped.<br/>
「… I guess I have to leave for a while, everyone.」<br/>
My comrades were looking at me with worried looks on their faces.<br/>
I followed behind Godan.<br/>
Why did the Chairman call for me?<br/>
Female warriors were few in number. Some of the commissions Freedom Fighters received were incompatible with male warriors. Like escorting a lady, for example.<br/>
It could be that kind of request. But then, why didn’t the Chairman dispatch the Hero of Earth, the strongest man in Teseshia? I was at the bottom rank of the organization.<br/>
I became even more anxious as to what commission I had been requested to complete.<br/>
◆ Black Haired Sage, Chiyuki<br/>
Freedom Fighter City, Teseshia.<br/>
It was a satellite city of the Republic Ariadya created to deal with the Evil God that resided in the labyrinth at the center of the Minon Plain. Fiendish demons came out if the labyrinth frequently, thus Freedom Fighters were gathered to subjugate the labyrinth.<br/>
The government of the Ariadya Republic deemed it a more feasible method than dispatching their knights and soldiers.<br/>
Because of it, almost all men in the city were Freedom Fighters, which was quite unusual. Not to mention, almost all of the residents of Teseshia didn’t have citizenship of the Republic Ariadya, something that didn’t happen to the other satellite cities.<br/>
To become a Freedom Fighter in Teseshia, one didn’t need to have citizenship of the Republic Ariadya. They could freely enter, leave or stay in the city.<br/>
Normally, one would call such a city as independent, or a city of freedom.<br/>
[TL: America?]<br/>
Unfortunately, perhaps because of that freedom in transiting, the public order in Teseshia was incredibly bad.<br/>
Despite being called ‘Freedom Fighters’, most of the people who lived in the city behaved more like Yakuza.<br/>
I believe the main reason Republic Ariadya created Teseshia wasn’t to deal with the labyrinth but to accommodate the refugees of another country from the Ariad Union.<br/>
It was the most consistent conclusion I could arrive at after pondering about the available evidence.<br/>
The one who governed Teseshia? The Freedom Fighter Association.<br/>
The one who maintained the public order in Teseshia? Also the Freedom Fighter Association.<br/>
After all, there was no reason to dispatch knights from Ariadya.<br/>
Despite being a satellite city, the government of the Republic Ariadya didn’t even maintain the public order. They didn’t even bother hiding how they had no concerns about Teseshia.<br/>
To begin with, the Freedom Fighter Association wasn’t created based on mutual aid like the Magician Association. It was probably created by the Ariadya government to keep control over the Freedom Fighters.<br/>
They just needed to take out some money from their budget and let the Freedom Fighter Association govern the place. They didn’t pay any attention to the city afterward.<br/>
