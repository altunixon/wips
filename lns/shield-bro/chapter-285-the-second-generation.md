Chapter 285: The Second Generation<br/>
"Let’s start a strategy meeting!"<br/>
Kiel returns with a despondent look on her face. Before I could order anything, she gathers up all of my forces and announces a meeting.<br/>
"This time, even after Niichan went to the trouble of modifying me, I wasn’t of any use at all." (Kiel)<br/>
"Kiel-kun tried her hardest. Her new form was also amazing." (Midori)<br/>
Midori turns to Kiel and throws some honest praise at her.<br/>
Even though he can be toxic, he’s also relatively sociable it seems.<br/>
"I think if Kiel-kun wasn’t there, then Motoyasu-san would have still been exchanging blows with the Hero of the Sword."<br/>
"That’s right." (Motoyasu)<br/>
Oh? Motoyasu can communicate with Kiel when she’s Kielberus?<br/>
That’s actually a bit surprising.<br/>
I thought Melty was the only woman whose words would get through to him.<br/>
"Motoyasu, what does Kiel look like to you?" (Naofumi)<br/>
"A dog with three heads, Father-in-Law." (Motoyasu)<br/>
"Okay, Kiel. Return to your normal form!" (Naofumi)<br/>
"Got it, Niichan!" (Kiel)<br/>
Kiel assumes her human form.<br/>
And Motoyasu’s gaze changes to that of someone staring at filth. He averts his eyes.<br/>
"A dog that can transform into a pig… That’s quite a dirty power." (Motoyasu)<br/>
Ah… because Kiel changed into something close to a monster, she got out of the category where gender mattered, I guess.<br/>
But Firo is recognized in both forms, and Kiel only in monster… What’s going on in Motoyasu’s head?<br/>
"Niichan, I’m sorry. I wasn’t helpful at all." (Kiel)<br/>
"Don’t mind it. They grasped your weaknesses, so there’s no helping it." (Naofumi)<br/>
"Then what am I supposed to do?" (Kiel)<br/>
That’s right.<br/>
Perhaps I should station her in an area that eliminates the effect of her weaknesses.<br/>
Honestly, more modifications than this will strain her body too much. It’s very likely she won’t be able to turn back.<br/>
"I’ll provide Kiel with ear plugs or earmuffs. The problem would be that I would have to give orders beforehand, and I won’t be able to coordinate your movements." (Naofumi)<br/>
That’s one of the possibilities I considered, but I never expected the situation to call for it so quickly.<br/>
I need to somehow eliminate her weakness of being unable to look away from sweets and being weak to lullabies.<br/>
For the latter, I can just cover her ears, but the former is difficult.<br/>
I could make sure they don’t have any treats on them… but I don’t have a concrete plan for that.<br/>
If I drew it into an underwater battle, then they wouldn’t be able to use it, but that would sacrifice Kiel’s improved mobility.<br/>
Anyways, I’ll have to consider how to use Kiel.<br/>
And wait a second…<br/>
"Kiel, if you’re fighting an enemy that you think you can beat, try your hardest to stay in your dog form. Only use your modified form when you need to." (Naofumi)<br/>
"So the only ones I should use it on are Raphtalia-chan, Rishia-neechan, and the heroes?" (Kiel)<br/>
"Yeah, that seems to be the case. I guess you should steer clear of the Granny and her disciples as well…" (Naofumi)<br/>
Though they don’t stand out, besides Raphtalia, Rishia, and Fohl, there are some others who underwent the Granny’s training.<br/>
This time, the fear from seeing Kiel’s Kielberus form caused them to be unable to act. But if they meet again, Kiel will be at a disadvantage.<br/>
"I’ll access the third tower… and institute a scanning feature. I’ll make it so that people carrying food-like items will be unable to reach the area where Kiel’s deployed." (Naofumi)<br/>
It will take up some time, but there’s no helping it.<br/>
"Um…"<br/>
"Hmm?" (Naofumi)<br/>
One of the slaves I treated trembles as it calls out to me.<br/>
This one didn’t participate in the Second Tower defense.<br/>
"Is there someone who’s threatening the… God of the Shield-sama?"<br/>
"Yeah, this world is full of people like that. A group of them are trying to invade this place. For that purpose, the people gathered here are putting a desperate effort towards defending this place, but the situation is turning stale." (Naofumi)<br/>
They even managed to destroy tower number two.<br/>
The main reason for this failure was that I deployed Rat’s monster before tuning him properly.<br/>
It was my own lack of judgment.<br/>
My next plan won’t have as many risks.<br/>
"Rafu~…"<br/>
Rat’s monster, AKA Mii-kun, stands around with a dejected expression.<br/>
Though he had enough battle power, he went out of control. It seems he’s repenting.<br/>
"Then… um…"<br/>
"What?" (Naofumi)<br/>
The treated slaves look at me with determination and step forward.<br/>
"Please modify us like you did that child!"<br/>
"… You guys just overcame human experimentation by the Three Hero Church. I don’t think you should be jumping at such notions." (Naofumi)<br/>
It’s fine if they just help with magic supplying and managing the lab.<br/>
Their levels and abilities are not fit for battle.<br/>
In the current situation, without the time to increase their level, I don’t find it necessary to send them to war.<br/>
"I think I said this with Kiel-chan as well, but Onee-chan wouldn’t recommend it." (Sadina)<br/>
"Sadina… should you be saying that? You were also quite useless this time around." (Naofumi)<br/>
"But I was fighting alongside the Raph Race that Naofumi-chan made with care. There’s no way I could get serious." (Sadina)<br/>
"Then you’ll be the one to finish off that faker." (Naofumi)<br/>
"That’s impossible. I mean, it’s Raphtalia-chan." (Sadina)<br/>
"That’s just a fake making a mockery of her form." (Naofumi)<br/>
"… Naofumi-chan believes that. But still, it’s hard for me to attack her, so I can’t get serious. You understand?" (Sadina)<br/>
"I see." (Naofumi)<br/>
Even though she’s evil, her appearance is the spitting image of the real one.<br/>
I guess I can understand how she would be hard to fight.<br/>
"And that’s how it is. You get it?" (Naofumi)<br/>
"… No, since you saved our lives, we would like to be of as much use to the God of the Shield-sama as possible."<br/>
All of them seem resolute as they face me.<br/>
I get the feeling that a half-hearted refusal on my part won’t move them.<br/>
No, I can easily refuse.<br/>
But if I do, they might use that resolution to infiltrate and try to defend the third tower anyways.<br/>
Even in jest, I can’t call their levels high. They’re very low.<br/>
Using my abilities, I can forcibly raise levels, but 30 is my limit.<br/>
Over that, and the strain on the body is too high. I don’t have enough energy to expend either.<br/>
"… Promise me this. When you march into battle, you will prioritize survival over all else." (Naofumi)<br/>
"If the God of the Shield wishes it." (All Treated Slaves)<br/>
"… Understood. I’ll modify you to your hearts’ content later. Before then, imagine your ideal form of power." (Naofumi)<br/>
"Ah, Naofumi-sama." (Atlas)<br/>
At that point, Atlas raised her hand.<br/>
"What is it?" (Naofumi)<br/>
"With Naofumi-sama’s power, I wish to get stronger." (Atlas)<br/>
"What are you saying, Atlas? Do you want to end up looking like that!?" (Fohl)<br/>
"Yes, Onii-sama. I’ll change into anything be it for Naofumi-sama’s sake. Also… I don’t want Onii-sama telling me that." (Atlas)<br/>
Atlas spit her words out while emitting bloodlust at Fohl.<br/>
Perhaps she’s referring to Fohl’s beast transformation form.<br/>
"I heard about it. Onii-sama turned into a fluffy animal and slept while being cuddled by Naofumi-sama… how envious am I." (Atlas)<br/>
"Uu… That’s wrong! I… I am…!" (Fohl)<br/>
"That’s why I want a fluffy form like Kiel-kun!" (Atlas)<br/>
"So you’re completely ignoring combat ability!" (Naofumi)<br/>
The difference in these people is too great.<br/>
But… Atlas is applying herself a lot.<br/>
I don’t mind modifying her to some extent.<br/>
If I fix her eyes, then perhaps her movements will become sharper.<br/>
At the very least, if I give her a transformation ability, she will get stronger.<br/>
"Okay, then I’ll make modifications with Atlas as my priority!" (Naofumi)<br/>
"You bastard-" (Fohl)<br/>
"Onii-sama! You’re wide open." (Atlas)<br/>
"Gefu!" (Fohl)<br/>
Atlas pricks an enraged Fohl from behind, and he falls forward.<br/>
These two are the same as ever.<br/>
"I jabbed a pressure point. For a little while, you won’t be able to muster up any strength. Firo-chan, can you restrain Onii-sama so he won’t be able to move?" (Atlas)<br/>
Firo stands on Fohl.<br/>
Like that, even Fohl will be rendered immobile.<br/>
"A-Atlas! Sto- STOOOOP!" (Fohl)<br/>
I signal Atlas to enter the culture tank and activate my Human Experimentation ability.<br/>
Symbols come from my shield and bind her. A window appears before my eyes.<br/>
And as soon as I look over it, I come to a conclusion.<br/>
"My apologies Atlas. It’s impossible for you." (Naofumi)<br/>
"W-why Naofumi-sama!?" (Atlas)<br/>
"You do not have the constitution to withstand modifications. More specifically, your body is already at its breaking point. There’s no room for any more." (Naofumi)<br/>
Due to her body, making the necessary changes will probably be fatal.<br/>
She was at her limit from the start. She doesn’t have the caliber.<br/>
She was originally weak, and she couldn’t even walk. She was always blind. Yet, now that child is walking on her own feet and even rushing into battle.<br/>
With that, she’s already near her own breaking point.<br/>
What’s more, this modification will require too much energy, so I don’t think I will be able to complete it. I’ll have to pay quite a bit of compensation for it. After this, I must conquer the world, so using that much here would be a pain.<br/>
"Give up." (Naofumi)<br/>
"Uu… If Naofumi-sama puts it like that, then I’ll reluctantly give up." (Atlas)<br/>
After getting out of the tank, Atlas motions Firo to move. Fohl lifts her up in his arms.<br/>
"I’m glad. Atlas didn’t have anything done to her." (Fohl)<br/>
"That’s unfortunate. I thought I would at least be able to return her vision." (Naofumi)<br/>
"H-her eyes… can be repaired.. you say!?" (Fohl)<br/>
Fohl glares at me in disbelief.<br/>
He truly is an excitable fellow.<br/>
"Then why didn’t you!?" (Fohl)<br/>
"I just explained it, didn’t I?" (Naofumi)<br/>
Even though he objected to it, why is he getting mad at me for not doing it?<br/>
"…" (Fohl)<br/>
With a regretful, yet glad, expression, Fohl steps back with Atlas in hand.<br/>
"Then… will Onii-sama be getting modified?" (Atlas)<br/>
"Wha- Atlas!" (Fohl)<br/>
"If Onii-sama become stronger, Naofumi-sama’s defenses will become unbreakable." (Atlas)<br/>
"Fumu… fine. Upon Atlas’s orders, I’ll grant you some modifications. Firo." (Naofumi)<br/>
"Yeah, got it!" (Firo)<br/>
Since he hasn’t fully recovered, Fohl is easily lifted into the culture tank by Firo.<br/>
"Wait! Unhand me! Something like this… I’ll never-" (Fohl)<br/>
"Onii-sama…" (Atlas)<br/>
"…" (Fohl)<br/>
Good, he quiets down.<br/>
I activate my powers and direct them at Fohl.<br/>
… What’s with this?<br/>
For different reasons, I can’t do anything to him.<br/>
Perhaps I should say he’s already in his perfect form.<br/>
He hasn’t unlocked it yet, but if he raises his own abilities, he already has another form.<br/>
(TL: Insert obligatory this isn’t even my final form)<br/>
He already has all of the abilities I granted to Kiel.<br/>
What is the meaning of this?<br/>
In Atlas’s case… her screen had a vestigial remnant of something similar. Does it have to do with their blood?<br/>
The Hakuko seem to be such a race.<br/>
"Atlas, what do you want me to do to Fohl?" (Naofumi)<br/>
"Please make him less fluffy." (Atlas)<br/>
That has nothing to do with battle. Rejected.<br/>
Ah, now that I think about it, when Kiel saw Fohl’s beast form, she got really excited and kept calling him, ‘cool.’ How long ago was that?<br/>
"If he concentrates harder, he can get another form much like the one I gave to Kiel." (Naofumi)<br/>
"For reals? Fohl-niichan is amazing!" (Kiel)<br/>
Kiel excitedly praises Fohl.<br/>
But Fohl doesn’t care for any words apart from his sister’s. He ignores it.<br/>
"R-really?" (Fohl)<br/>
"… What sort of form is it?" (Atlas)<br/>
"It seems to be a larger white tiger. Though his weaknesses increase, his abilities rise. It requires a lot of discipline to achieve. Actually, it seems to be impossible." (Naofumi)<br/>
I mean… there’s too much. Fohl’s raised his level quite a bit, but he hasn’t even fulfilled half of the necessary requirements to unlock it.<br/>
The Hakuko race can climb up to level 120, but… he needs to be at least 180 to use it.<br/>
Anyways, I can’t modify him further.<br/>
Ah, right. The messenger from Silt Welt could transform too.<br/>
The feeling he gave off was kinda like that of a monster. Is that related to this…?<br/>
The Hakuko blood’s already been modified to its fullest.<br/>
"Anyways, until the third tower’s boost runs out, I’ll modify you all into whatever form you want. Of course, like Atlas over there, there may be some who cannot be changed. Prepare yourselves for that." (Naofumi)<br/>
"Yes!" (Treated Slaves)<br/>
Good answer.<br/>
I guess I may be able to count on them a bit.<br/>
"Then everyone else, review your shortcomings and prepare for tommorow’s battle." (Naofumi)<br/>
I signal the group to disperse.<br/>
You know, I actually have a mountain of things I have to be doing.<br/>
This time, I made improvements on the Raph race and made my next creation. I had just finished my Tali race and now this.<br/>
The second generation Raphs are made by fixing the low abilities of the first generation in mind. Their base abilities and intelligence are increased.<br/>
Their appearance is still the same, but they’ll be more powerful than the first generation.<br/>
The Tali race is made in a form closer to that of humans.<br/>
I made it so they are bipedal.<br/>
As I rest to recover energy to modify the slaves, Firo comes with the other monsters.<br/>
"What’s up?" (Naofumi)<br/>
"Well, you see, these children asked when it was their turn to get modified." (Firo)<br/>
"Ah, so that’s it. What sort of shape do you want?" (Naofumi)<br/>
As I asked, the monsters turn to the Raph and Tali race specimens in the tanks and cry out.<br/>
"They want to be of the small oneechan race. In a way different from with Mii-kun." (Firo)<br/>
"I see…" (Naofumi)<br/>
What an advantageous proposal.<br/>
If they wish to aid in my experiments, then my research will progress.<br/>
And these monsters are of relatively high level too.<br/>
Combined with the Raph Race’s power, they’ll become much more useful than the mass produced models.<br/>
"If that’s the case, then it’s simple." (Naofumi)<br/>
I’ve already established the foundation.<br/>
I’ll just have to implant the Raph race genes into them to whatever extent they wish it.<br/>
Based on the results of their changes, my research will advance.<br/>
"Well, I’ll leave it up to you guys to what extent you want to keep your original races." (Naofumi)<br/>
Today will be a busy one.<br/>
Until the third tower becomes vulnerable, I pour my efforts into modifying the slaves and the monsters.<br/>
By the way, Firo left to invite Melty over and returned in failure.<br/>
It seems that the princess is rejecting my plan.<br/>
I was going to purify all of the trashy nobility in Malromark and spare only her, yet this is how she reacts.<br/>
She’s a stubborn lass.<br/>
"Ah, Firo. Do you want me to add anything to you?" (Naofumi)<br/>
"Um, you see, Firo is…" (Firo)<br/>
I hear out Firo’s request as well.<br/>
"Let’s see. I’ll try to take care of it when I find time." (Naofumi)<br/>
"Yay!" (Firo)<br/>
She was depressed after being rejected by Melty, but she regains some vigor.<br/>
How selfish a bird.<br/>
"Ah, Naofumi-sama…" (Atlas)<br/>
As always, Atlas is sleeping near me.<br/>
Fohl failed in dragging her away.<br/>
