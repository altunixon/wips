Chapter 332: A Kitsune has Seven Forms, and a Tanuki, Eight<br/>
(TL: This is a Japanese saying that just says the Tanuki is more skilled in deception, but has less malicious intent)<br/>
"Hmm… now my anger is a little… no, it hasn’t cleared at all." (Naofumi)<br/>
I kick the fallen Tact as I spit out these words.<br/>
"Exactly. I think we should just kill him already." (Fohl)<br/>
"Don’t be that way. This man needs to face greater despair. For the crime of killing Atlas, the Queen, and my villagers, this isn’t nearly enough." (Naofumi)<br/>
"… Understood, Aniki."<br/>
Now then, I look around.<br/>
I wonder how Raphtalia and the others are faring.<br/>
First, Raphtalia is… before I can turn my eyes to her, lightning surges, and I turn my attention to that.<br/>
"Oy, wait. This onee-san isn’t satisfied at all, yet…" (Sadina)<br/>
Sadina is lifting up her enemy, who now looks like nothing but a grilled piece of fish, while she continues to discharge electricity.<br/>
When I remember what I did to Tact, I don’t think I’m in a place to say this, but I think she’s going a bit too far.<br/>
So Sadina was someone this vicious… No, perhaps she channeled my rage.<br/>
Her opponent is… dead already, right?<br/>
Death by electrocution doesn’t sound too nice.<br/>
"Naofumi-chan, this onee-san hasn’t rampaged enough yet." (Sadina)<br/>
"You’ve done enough." (Naofumi)<br/>
"When I’m in this form, it makes me feel mildly drunk. It’s not a bad feeling~" (Sadina)<br/>
"Just turn back already." (Naofumi)<br/>
"Ara, he got mad at me." (Sadina)<br/>
Sadina follows my orders and turns back to her Orca form.<br/>
Now then, to lecture her… no, I’ll leave that for another time.<br/>
"And wait, you still haven’t recovered?" (Naofumi)<br/>
"Oh my, Naofumi-chan saw the colors he dyed me." (Sadina)<br/>
(TL: as in her brown form)<br/>
She makes an annoying embarrassed pose as she messes around, but her actions are no joke.<br/>
"She went and mistook me for a Luka, and I was still quite pissed off because of Atlas-chan and Naofumi-chan. That was quite refreshing." (Sadina)<br/>
She says, as she points her harpoon at Tact and starts releasing electricity at him.<br/>
Her tone heavily implies that her stress is still built up. She’s definitely angry.<br/>
She’s the type that acts flippant when she’s really angry, I guess.<br/>
I mean… She is the oldest one in the village, and the one’s who’s like everyone’s older sister.<br/>
There’s no way she isn’t mad about Atlas.<br/>
"So after Fohl is Sadina, and…" (Naofumi)<br/>
Sadina points her harpoon at the remaining women, who were moving to do something.<br/>
"If you move around, you may become like this child, so stay still." (Sadina)<br/>
"Hii!" (Women) (TL: Sound of fear)<br/>
After seeing the end of the one who challenged Sadina, it seems these women won’t make a move against her.<br/>
Tact’s wrung out like a wet rag, the Aotatsu women had her head blown off, and finally we have electrocution.<br/>
Honestly, I don’t think I would make a move if I was in their position.<br/>
"DERYAAAAAAAH!"<br/>
"KYUAAAAAAAAAAA!"<br/>
"AAAAAAAAH!"<br/>
Hmm? I hear Ren and Gaelion’s voices shouting out.<br/>
When I looked up, I saw the moment when the giant body of the Dragon Empress colliding with the fortress.<br/>
Gaelion had his mouth clamped on the giant’s throat, and Ren had his sword on her core.<br/>
A large tremor radiates from the building.<br/>
"KUUUUAH!"<br/>
Gaelion cries out in a muffled voice.<br/>
"Don’t screw with me! Give you my Dragon Emperor Core!? A minor fragment like you, who needed a hero’s assistance to challenge me shouldn’t get so high and mighty!"<br/>
When it looks like the dragon is going to act up again, Ren applies force to his sword, and she roars.<br/>
The end is clear.<br/>
"Even if I perish, you shall not obtain it!"<br/>
"… Gyau."<br/>
She flipped a switch. That one is the Adult Gaelion.<br/>
Likely, they had switched places numerous times in battle as they assisted Ren.<br/>
And this is the time when he offers his words of parting to his fellow fragment.<br/>
An ominous sound rings through the air.<br/>
"Gufu…"<br/>
It was the sound of Gaelion piercing through the empress’s throat.<br/>
The giant body convulses and stops moving. Ren lifts his sword and skillfully uses the blocks of the fortress wall to climb up it.<br/>
"Is it over?" (Ren)<br/>
"For argument’s sake." (Naofumi)<br/>
I place my foot on Tact as I declare this.<br/>
What is Gaelion doing?<br/>
Uu…<br/>
He appears to be in the middle of a meal.<br/>
Blood is gushing out like a fountain, and Gaelion digs around the inside of the Dragon Empress’s body.<br/>
I’ve seen Firo feast on wild monsters before, but this scene is much more grotesque.<br/>
Ren covers his mouth with his hand as he witnesses the scene.<br/>
He’s definitely stomaching his urge to throw up.<br/>
"W-what is… he doing?" (Ren)<br/>
"The enemy dragon spoke of minor fragments and Dragon Emperor Fragments, right?" (Naofumi)<br/>
"Yeah." (Ren)<br/>
"The entity called the Dragon Emperor was split into thousands of Fragments, and their parts compete to complete the whole. Something about collecting past memories…" (Naofumi)<br/>
"I don’t really get it, but pretty much, Gaelion has a fragment, and he’s claiming one from that Giant Dragon?" (Ren)<br/>
"Apparently. And since the opponent didn’t submit, he killed her and is manually trying to take it." (Naofumi)<br/>
The fragments were supposed to gather when the world was in peril. I thought that Gaelion didn’t seem to have the instinct to collect them all, but he went and hunted Tact’s Dragon.<br/>
Gaelion greedily gnaws on the Enemy Dragon’s heart.<br/>
I’ll bet the fragment is kept somewhere around there.<br/>
"He’ll likely gain the knowledge of how to breach level 100. If all goes well, Gaelion’ll be able to bestow that power too." (Naofumi)<br/>
"I see! So we’ll be able to make the villagers and the people of the country stronger!" (Ren)<br/>
"It’s only a possibility." (Naofumi)<br/>
But considering that, I can’t really kill Tact yet.<br/>
If I don’t get the knowledge of how to breach 100 from him, the future looks grim.<br/>
Looking at the air, Firo is still fighting the enemy Gryphon.<br/>
"You’re quite… skillful."<br/>
"Firo won’t lose!" (Firo)<br/>
But I can tell at a glance who has the better prospects of victory.<br/>
Firo’s movements are sharper.<br/>
The Gryphon’s already taken hits here and there, and she’s on the verge of collapse.<br/>
The end will eventually come.<br/>
I should really get to Raphtalia already.<br/>
I concentrate my attention on her battle.<br/>
Raphtalia and Raph-chan continue their illusionary battle with the Kitsune woman.<br/>
"You’re good for a Raccoon. I remember… the Raccoon who sealed me carried a scent like yours!"<br/>
"I don’t know what you’re talking about, nor do I have any interest." (Raphtalia)<br/>
It really is a battle of delusion.<br/>
Fire rains, and water wells up. The surrounding landscape is warping.<br/>
Was Raphtalia that great of a mage?<br/>
Or is this just an illusion?<br/>
Raphtalia’s ability to see through illusions is high.<br/>
I bet that’s why she can keep up with that Kitsune’s blows.<br/>
Affinity is important.<br/>
It’s good that Tact didn’t cooperate with that woman.<br/>
If I were to challenge her without the Cane, it would probably be impossible.<br/>
Well, if that were the case, I would need Raphtalia’s help to dispel her illusions.<br/>
"Rafu~" (Raph-chan)<br/>
"Hmm, duplication magic, is it? Do you truly think I am unable to see through it?"<br/>
Raph-chan changes to a form identical to Raphtalia and stands next to her.<br/>
Oy… she didn’t notice?<br/>
Ah, I see. This was what Raphtalia was training for.<br/>
If that’s the case, this might prove to be an effective weapon.<br/>
Though, I feel this is a bit too light for a decisive blow.<br/>
"Raphtalia! Catch!" (Naofumi)<br/>
I throw the Houou Sword at Raphtalia.<br/>
"Rafu~!"<br/>
But Raph-chan jumps up high and catches the sword I threw.<br/>
Eh? Raph-chan’s taking it?<br/>
And wait, there’s a problem more important than that. Can Raph-chan even use weapons?<br/>
"So that one’s the real one!"<br/>
Raph-chan uses the sword to deflect a blow aimed at him.<br/>
Ah, so that was his intention when he intercepted it.<br/>
Despite his cute appearance, he has a surprisingly good head on his shoulders.<br/>
"Hahaha, Raccoon wench. To think you thought an illusion of this level would -gufu!?"<br/>
The real Raphtalia stabs the smiling Kitsune woman in the back.<br/>
She really was deceived.<br/>
It seems Raphtalia was more skillful.<br/>
"Unfortunately, you were wrong." (Raphtalia)<br/>
"Rafu~." (Raph-chan)<br/>
"Impossible… an illusion with physical substance!? Even its scent is the same!"<br/>
"I have no reason to tell you the truth of the matter. Isn’t it a battle of deception? Anyways… what did you think this child was supposed to be?" (Raphtalia)<br/>
"Raccoon wench… so it wasn’t you who used an illusion to breach the Dragon Emperor and the Gryphon’s sanctuary…"<br/>
So Tact’s side thought it was Raphtalia who used the sanctuary.<br/>
Even their most skilled illusionist was deceived, so I guess they thought Raph-chan was merely a part of her.<br/>
In truth, he was created with her genes, so even his scent is the same.<br/>
His voice and feel are different, though. I’ll investigate it later.<br/>
"Unfortunately, no." (Raphtalia)<br/>
Raphtalia pulls out her sword, and starts a coordinated attack with Raph-chan.<br/>
Right, this attack was the one that Trash proposed.<br/>
Using one of them as bait, and making an opening for the other. And Raphtalia, and Raph-chan…<br/>
"Here we go! Make sure to keep up with me!" (Raphtalia)<br/>
"Rafu~!" (Raph-chan)<br/>
Raphtalia starts unleashing sword strikes at a high speed.<br/>
"Na-…  gu-… u…"<br/>
Slash, thrust, rest, Karma Blade, kick, First Stroke, Second Stroke, Third Stroke, followed by a stream of Hengen Musou sword skills.<br/>
And Raph-chan imitates that as if a mirror was placed on the other side of the Kitsune’s body.<br/>
This brings to mind a famous attack from a fighting game.I believe it was the attack of a Demon of Dreams.<br/>
The combo ended with them lifting their swords together, turning their backs to the Kitsune, and swinging downward to wipe off the blood.<br/>
「Illusion Mirror」!<br/>
「Rafu~」!<br/>
Raph-chan returns to his Tanuki form.<br/>
"I have… yet to… fall."<br/>
Though she should have collapsed, the Kitsune woman stands while covered in blood.<br/>
No matter how you look at it, it’s her loss… the woman’s form gradually begins to change.<br/>
… As if her transformation had been dispelled, her shape becomes that of a giant fox.<br/>
Is this the time for me to offer assistance?<br/>
When I took a step in their direction…<br/>
"Not… yet."<br/>
Tact’s consciousness returns, and he suddenly stands up.<br/>
<br/>
