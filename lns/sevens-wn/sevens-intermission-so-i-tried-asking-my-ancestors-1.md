<br/>
It was in the Jewel, the round table room.<br/>
The ancestors were troubling Lyle, raining him with their usual jeers.<br/>
"That’s why you’re no good!"<br/>
"I’ll have to agree. Why did you run away there?"<br/>
"I really wonder what that makes you as a man."<br/>
"The worst. You’ve crossed zero into the negatives. The negatives!"<br/>
"Just sleep with her already. That’ll be the end of it."<br/>
"Lyle, you need to understand a woman’s heart better."<br/>
"Sixth, please repeat those words in front of a mirror. But Lyle, that really was pitiful."<br/>
It all started in an inn in Dalien, where Lyle had managed to make a good atmosphere with Novem.<br/>
But Lyle himself failed to notice so, and fed up as she was, Novem dealt with him with a smile.<br/>
The problem was, having witnessed that, the ancestors dragged Lyle into the Jewel to find fault with him.<br/>
Lyle was made to kneel on the floor as he hung his head.<br/>
"But there’s no way I could understand that sort of atmosphere, or rather…"<br/>
The Fourth pushed up his glasses, letting the lenses eerily catch the light as he let out a low voice.<br/>
"An excuse eh… this is worse than I thought."<br/>
Ever fussy when it came to the treatment of women, the Fourth had been dissatisfied with Lyle’s attitude towards Novem for a long time now.<br/>
"Listen well, Lyle! When things were going so rosy between you, not doing anything at all is a discourtesy to the woman."<br/>
His socialization skills disastrous from the start, Lyle impatiently put up resistance against the Fourth.<br/>
"No, um… Novem’s face was definitely a little red, and her smile was a different one than usual, but… I didn’t really get what to do next or rather, in a situation where you’re all watching me, I’m not really sure what I’m supposed to do."<br/>
The excuse Lyle gave was that he was unable to do anything in a situation where he was under constant surveillance from the ancestors in the Jewel.<br/>
But that was something the others agreed with as well.<br/>
The Fifth gave a light nod.<br/>
"Well, that’s definitely a problem. "<br/>
The other ancestors held a similar opinion.<br/>
The Fifth…<br/>
"Sure enough, I’d be troubled to respond if you suddenly embraced her. Well, if we just make it so we can’t interfere at those times alone…"<br/>
As everyone began to say something like that, Lyle found it in himself to question it a bit.<br/>
(They’re all just booing me, but generally speaking, what should I have done?)<br/>
That’s why he asked.<br/>
"Umm…"<br/>
The First irritably looked at Lyle.<br/>
"What is it?"<br/>
"I still don’t get what I should have done. How would all of you have handled umm—‘What would you do when your wife shows you a different smile than usual’?"<br/>
The ancestors were more flustered than Lyle expected. They all tried imagining a scene where their wife would show them a different smile than usual.<br/>
… It happened.<br/>
Right after, Lyle sensed the large jewel embedded in the center of the round table let off a faint light.<br/>
(What is this? Did something just glow? Huh? Did the others see…)<br/>
Noticing something strange was going on, Lyle looked at his ancestors.<br/>
The First had broken into a clearly strange sweat as he held his head.<br/>
It was almost as if everyone was seeing an illusion of their wife before their eyes.<br/>
"T-that ain’t it, dear. So you don’t have to approach me with that smile. I’m begging you, forgive meeeeeeee!!"<br/>
The Second shook his head as he prepared to flee. While he usually dressed himself in a relatively taciturn air, he was now desperately calling out to his unseen wife.<br/>
"Just give me a moment. Yeah, could you give me just a bit of time to think? D-don’t come any closeeer!!"<br/>
The Third was smiling as per usual, but he was shedding a cold sweat.<br/>
With both his hands, he gestured for the other party to wait as he spoke.<br/>
"I got it, let’s talk things out. So for now, how about you stop spinning around the iron ball? Let’s start by clearing up our misunderstandings."<br/>
(Iron ball!? Eh? He’s talking to his wife, right?)<br/>
Lyle looked at the cowering figures of his firm ancestors as he thought of just what sort of people his ancestors’ wives could be.<br/>
Meanwhile, the Fourth slipped under the round table, his body hunched over and quivering.<br/>
For a while, now, he was only repeating the same words.<br/>
"I’m sorry. I’m sorry. I’m sor–"<br/>
The fifth alone wasn’t sweating. But with a straight face…<br/>
"… What are you planning?"<br/>
In a situation with his wife showing a different smile than usual, he could only hold doubt. Perhaps he wondered what lay beneath that smile, as he seemed deep in thought to probe it out.<br/>
(… What happened to everyone? Could it be they really are seeing illusions?)<br/>
They were in the Jewel. A space where it wouldn’t be strange if anything happened.<br/>
As he thought that, Lyle searched out the Sixth.<br/>
"Huh? The Sixth is gone?"<br/>
… The Sixth had fled long ago.<br/>
The Seventh was making a pale face, his back was straight, but he seemed somewhat fidgety.<br/>
"Zenoir, hear me out. You don’t have to approach me with that smile. Stop. You have to stop! I get it. It’s about that, right? About when I told Maizel that embarrassing story about you? Eh? That’s not it? That’s extra? Alright, first let’s take some distance from one another so we can discuss this. S-stop! Don’t point the gunpoint this way!"<br/>
(Gunpoint… grandmother was surprisingly extreme.)<br/>
Zenoir was Lyle’s grandmother. But Lyle only had the impression of her as a kind grandmother.<br/>
Perhaps seeing illusions, the ancestors tormented by their wives.<br/>
Lyle calmly looked at them and thought.<br/>
"… I wonder what sort of people the ancestors’ wives were."<br/>
