After agreeing to explain the contents of tonight’s discussion to the rest of the royal guards staying in the city in the morning of the next day, we dismissed the meeting and went back to our respective rooms.<br/>
I started working on drawing magic circles for the dryers inside my room for a while. I stopped when I judged that it was time to sleep.<br/>
(Alan, sorry, but can we discuss something with you for a bit?)<br/>
(Alright. I’ll go to your room.)<br/>
Sharon messaged me before I got the chance to go to bed. I wonder what the matter was as I headed to their room.<br/>
"Sorry for disturbing you this late. It’s not really something all that pressing, but…" Selena began.<br/>
"We heard from Cleria and the others this morning. About Corinth-style swordsmanship, I mean." Sharon followed up.<br/>
Ah! So that’s it. It looks like they really ended up finding out.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
"Hey Alan, just where did you learn swordsmanship?" Selena asked.<br/>
"Oh, uh, I kinda dabbled in it for a bit when I was young."<br/>
"That’s amazing! Isn’t something like swords considered a really minor hobby back at the empire? To think you’d even sublimated your knowledge and skills into actual swordsmanship! That’s really impressive!"<br/>
Ugh. Please stop. Selena’s sincere words are landing critical hits and giving me great mental damage.  <br/>
"Are Cleria-san and Elna-san learning Corinth-style swordsmanship from you, Alan? I seem to recall them saying that during our talks. Can you also teach it to both of us? If possible, can you update our databases with the related knowledge tonight?" <br/>
"Yeah, alright. It’s knowledge needed if you want to integrate yourselves to this world after all.  I understand. I’ll send all the data via the nanoms later."<br/>
I made a swift strategic retreat in order not to receive any more damage. I hurriedly got out of their room in a fluster.<br/>
Since I’ve been actively practicing my sword skills along with my magic skills lately, I managed to remember all the combos I used during my time in the game when I was a kid. Of course, this includes all my custom combos for ‘Corinth-style swordsmanship’ as well. <br/>
Aw crap. I don’t really mind sending them data regarding swordsmanship, but all the names of the combos used in ‘Corinth-style swordsmanship’ are absolutely embarrassing. Meteor Storm, Final Blade, Justice Judgement, Big Bang Burst, Thunder Bomb, Eternal Stream……  I have to hurry and make up some new names for them asap!<br/>
……Argh! I can’t think of any decent names to replace them with. Screw it! I’ll just send it as is! I don’t care what happens anymore.<br/>
(Please send all the related data regarding swordsmanship to Sharon and Selena.)<br/>
"Acknowledged." <br/>
Ugh. I’ve gone and done it. I’ll just go to sleep. Can I even get to sleep, though?<br/>
<br/>
I managed to wake up just before breakfast time. I obviously took longer to wake up compared to my usual daily schedule. It was difficult for me to fall asleep last night, so I ended up a bit sleep-deprived in the end. But it can’t be helped.  <br/>
When I went down to the dining area, I found everyone else already sitting on a table while waiting for breakfast to be served. <br/>
"Good morning, Alan!"<br/>
Hm? That’s strange. Selena and Sharon are acting normally. And here I was, all worried about them being creeped out with me. Did the update fail to go through or something?<br/>
"Oh, Alan-dono! Good morning. Please. Go ahead and sit over here." <br/>
Roberto offered up the seat beside Cleria again.  <br/>
"Good morning, Roberto."<br/>
Today’s breakfast consisted of potato sandwiches, egg sandwiches, and chicken, ham, and vegetable salad sandwiches. It looks like all of them made use of plenty of mayonnaise. Each kind was piled in great quantities on top of large plates.  <br/>
"Oh! These are quite the excellent dishes as well!"<br/>
"They really are tasty!"<br/>
Roberto, Captain Dalshim, Selena, and Sharon all ended up liking the sandwiches a lot. The power of mayonnaise really can’t be underestimated. <br/>
The sandwiches piled on top of the large plates were finished off in the blink of an eye. <br/>
"Alan, just as we discussed yesterday, we are going to explain everything to the rest of the royal guards. Please come with us as well."<br/>
"Yes, of course. After that, I’m planning to head over to Tarus-san’s place as well. I want to thank them for all their help, and I also want to consult them regarding the preparations for our journey."<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
"Let us do so then."<br/>
"We will head out today as well. We have to make haste and tell the good news to the rest of our comrades, and have Captain Dalshim and the rest of the royal guards to rejoin with you all once more afterward."  <br/>
During yesterday’s discussion, it was decided that Roberto would be in charge of gathering up all the two thousand plus loyal vassals in preparation for our future plans, while Captain Dalshim and the other royal guards were to join up with us in order to provide support to our party.  <br/>
"I see. Alright then. By the way, will your funds be enough for your future activities?"<br/>
"T-That’s… They are not exactly plentiful, but we will make do somehow."<br/>
"I see! I completely failed to notice. Just how were you planning on securing your living expenses?" Cleria inquired in concern. <br/>
"Before we parted with the earl, we received more than enough funds from him. We have managed to make do with it since."<br/>
"Please be honest with us, Roberto. Just how much money do you guys have left?"<br/>
"About fifty thousand Guineas." <br/>
I really don’t think that amount will be enough for the living expenses of more than two thousand people. <br/>
"That is obviously lacking."<br/>
"No, we will make do! We are planning to make our comrades who do not wish to participate with our plans to come back to their hometowns post haste and…" <br/>
"Even so, I still think it won’t be enough. Understood. I do not have much on me right now as well, but I shall contribute what I can."<br/>
"Oh! That will be a great help, Alan! We will return all the borrowed money, of course."<br/>
"No, there’s no need to do so. We’re all comrades here. And comrades are supposed to help one another during trying times, right?"<br/>
"We are most grateful, Alan-dono…" <br/>
After drinking our after-meal tea, we gathered inside Cleria’s room once again. Afterward, I retrieved the counterfeit gold coins Selena and Sharon brought from the ship.<br/>
"Is it really okay, Alan?" Selena asked.<br/>
"Yeah, no problem. We’re planning to make lots of money from doing quests anyway after all. We’ll manage." <br/>
I placed the bags filled with gold coins brought by Selena and Sharon on top of the table. All in all, it amounted to sixty large gold coins.<br/>
""Oh! This is–!""<br/>
Well, since I’ve gone this far, I better just hand over my money as well. I’ll be able to make a total of six hundred twenty thousand Guineas after four days thanks to my prior transactions. I think bringing a hundred thousand Guineas as our travel money will be more than enough. Of the five hundred fifty thousand Guineas we had on hand, I placed four hundred fifty thousand Guineas on the table. So, along with the large gold coins, there was a total of six million four hundred fifty thousand Guineas currently on the table. I’m sure they’ll have no trouble with funds for a while with this much.<br/>
"You cannot be thinking of giving us this much, Alan!?"<br/>
"We really don’t have a need for this much money after all. You have two thousand plus mouths to feed, so I’m sure you’ll need plenty of money. And I also said I managed to get a job order yesterday, right? I’ll be receiving six hundred thousand plus Guineas after four days, so we’ll be fine."  <br/>
"More than six hundred thousand Guineas!? Just what kind of job did you receive?" <br/>
"I got an order from Tarus-san for magic tools. I’m scheduled to deliver thirty units all in all." <br/>
""Magic tool!""<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
"Alan! Can I and Sharon also make those so-called magic tools!?" Selena excitedly asked.<br/>
"Yup. I’m sure you and Sharon can make them too."<br/>
Sharon already has magic tool making knowledge uploaded to her database, and with the nanom’s help, drawing magic circles will be simply like filling in coloring book pages. I’m sure they’ll have absolutely no problems making them.<br/>
"If so, then I’ll also help you with your job!"<br/>
"I’ll help too!"<br/>
I managed to get two reliable assistants. If all three of us worked together, I’m sure we can finish all the magic circles in one evening. <br/>
"I would also like to help as well, but…" Cleria sighed. <br/>
"I’ve got enough helpers. Okay then, Roberto. Go ahead and take this money."<br/>
"Thank you very much, Alan-dono. We shall use this money well."<br/>
Even with six million four hundred thousand Guineas, if the funds get divided equally to, let’s say, two thousand one hundred people, one person will end up receiving just a little over three thousand Guineas. It will still not be enough for living expenses. <br/>
"Oh, right! How about we also periodically send part of the money our party will earn from now on to you all as well?"  <br/>
