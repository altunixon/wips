Chapter 266: Tiger Man<br/>
"And that’s how it is, Fohl. In order to make sure that neither Raphtalia nor Atlas sleeps with me, I’ve decided to sleep at your place." (Naofumi)<br/>
"Get out!" (Fohl)<br/>
I went to Fohl’s room the following night,.<br/>
By the way, Raphtalia is in the next room just in case. If Fohl acts up, or something bad happens, she’ll rush over.<br/>
This morning, Raphtalia said that Firo, the Loinclothed Dog, and Imya ‘got an unfair head start,’ but I wonder what they were racing in.<br/>
"What are you talking about? Does the man who was dead drunk yesterday have the right to refuse?" (Naofumi)<br/>
"Gu…" (Fohl)<br/>
Fohl gives a pained grunt.<br/>
"You’re able to prevent your sister from sleeping with me." (Naofumi)<br/>
"You haven’t slept with Atlas yet!?" (Fohl)<br/>
"Yeah." (Naofumi)<br/>
I mean, this guy apparently learned Hengen Musou as well, and he trained with Raphtalia.<br/>
He’s strong. Or at least, he should be.<br/>
Anyways, if he assists Raphtalia, the two-on-one would become two-on-two, so we should be able to win.<br/>
But, he can’t lay a hand on Atlas, so I doubt he’ll use his full strength…<br/>
When Ren gets back, I’ll ask him as well. I bet he’d put up a better fight than this one.<br/>
"You bastard! Are you saying Atlas has no charm as a woman!?" (Fohl)<br/>
"What the hell are you talking about?" (Naofumi)<br/>
"I mean, isn’t that right!? You had so much time, and Atlas was sleeping in the same room as you every night, right?" (Fohl)<br/>
"That’s right." (Naofumi)<br/>
"So you’re telling me my cute sister has no womanly charm!?" (Fohl)<br/>
"Like I care." (Naofumi)<br/>
I really don’t.<br/>
Whenever I talk to Fohl, it turns out like this.<br/>
"Bastard! You’re saying my Atlas isn’t cute!?" (Fohl)<br/>
"I have no interest. And what do you mean by your Atlas…?" (Naofumi)<br/>
Ah, this is getting to be a pain.<br/>
When he learned I was sleeping with Atlas, he snapped. When I clarified that I wasn’t sleeping with Atlas, he also snapped.<br/>
"Don’t worry about it. Just lie down already." (Naofumi)<br/>
I lie flat on the bed and beckon Fohl over.<br/>
"Wha…" (Fohl)<br/>
Fohl’s face gets paler and paler.<br/>
"Could it be… you…" (Fohl)<br/>
"What is it? Ah, I think you were able to beast transform, right? Transform and come to the bed." (Naofumi)<br/>
I don’t know Sadina’s true form, but Loinclothed Dog’s is a puppy.<br/>
Perhaps Fohl can become a Tiger cub or something.<br/>
"S-stop it! I don’t have such preferences!" (Fohl)<br/>
"What’s this about preferences?" (Naofumi)<br/>
Is beast transform considered bad taste?<br/>
Then the Loinclothed Dog has bad preferences, I guess.<br/>
"Hah… Hah…"<br/>
From the ceiling, I hear strained breathing.<br/>
"I-intruder!" (Fohl)<br/>
Fohl releases an orb of magic from his fists.<br/>
A section of the ceiling smashes, and a human drops to the floor.<br/>
It’s the Tailor.<br/>
"I had the feeling that a glorious situation would present itself, so I came to watch. Thank you for the splendid meal!" (Tailor)<br/>
She’s energetically sketching something.<br/>
What’s she doing? I have a bad feeling about this.<br/>
There’s no doubt that she’s misunderstanding something.<br/>
"For now, get out." (Naofumi)<br/>
I grab the Tailor’s collar and toss her out of the house.<br/>
"And so, there will be no misunderstandings. Now transform and get in the bed." (Naofumi)<br/>
"N-no!" (Fohl)<br/>
I sense the Tailor putting her ear to the door.<br/>
"Be quick about it. I’m sleepy." (Naofumi)<br/>
I activate Fohl’s slave seal and issue an order.<br/>
"Gu… You bastard… uu… I-I got it already." (Foahl)<br/>
I guess he isn’t able to withstand the slave seal like Atlas. Fohl changes shape.<br/>
He’s a splendid white tiger.<br/>
He seems quite muscular, and I’m a little disappointed that he’s not a cub.<br/>
This is strange, the dog definitely gave off a cute impression.<br/>
But he seems powerful.<br/>
I wonder just how strong he is.<br/>
Right now, I get the impression that Atlas is the stronger one. She’s already worked off her own debt without Fohl’s help.<br/>
"Well, I guess that works too. Come to the bed already. If I have that fur around it’ll be easier to sleep." (Naofumi)<br/>
"Uu…" (Fohl)<br/>
With the face of a dead man, Fohl lies on the bed.<br/>
As I extend my hand, he immediately jumps back.<br/>
Well, I just wanted to touch him a bit.<br/>
"A-Atlas, for your sake, your brother is willing to give up his purity. Even if I become tainted, I definitely won’t lose!" (Fohl)<br/>
"Shut up. Go to sleep." (Naofumi)<br/>
It’s not like I’ve awakened to homosexuality.<br/>
But if Sadina and Atlas get that impression and give up, then I guess that’s fine too.<br/>
If Fohl’s fine with it, then I…<br/>
No. The idea is rejected.<br/>
What sort of sad situation would lead to me sleeping with a tiger? But, it’s better than not being able to sleep with Atlas and Raphtalia.<br/>
When Firo and Kiel slept with me, Raphtalia seemed to get unhappy, so…<br/>
‘Then is the male Fohl fine?’ I asked, and she permitted it, though she had on quite a strange expression at the time.<br/>
Of course, I have my reasons for choosing Fohl.<br/>
There’s something I’m curious about.<br/>
"Right, during the brainwashing incident, you and Atlas were speaking with Trash about something, right? What were you talking about?" (Naofumi)<br/>
"Why do I have to tell someone like you?" (Fohl)<br/>
"If he was plotting something, would you be able to figure it out? He’s the man that drove your entire clan into a corner, you know." (Naofumi)<br/>
"Uu…" (Fohl)<br/>
When they first met, I got some information from the Queen.<br/>
Without making any excuses, Fohl begins speaking.<br/>
"He tried to offer Atlas some food, so I tried to escape. He seemed to have aged a bit since when I met him with you. He had no energy." (Fohl)<br/>
"That seems likely." (Naofumi)<br/>
"What are you doing? I’m calling out to someone who greatly resembles Onii-sama. I’m not that old, and it doesn’t make me happy if you say I’m like the enemy of the Hakuko race. Hmph." (Fohl)<br/>
"Start from the beginning." (Naofumi)<br/>
"… Understood. After that, the old man looked over me and Atlas, and started gazing far away. He said in a sad tone, ‘No matter what happens, you’ve got to protect your sister, okay? Otherwise, you’ll regret it for the rest of your life.’" (Fohl)<br/>
"… I see." (Naofumi)<br/>
That was within my expectations.<br/>
If the speaker wasn’t Trash, those would have been wise words.<br/>
"What is that man doing? Why is he trying to approach Atlas?" (Fohl)<br/>
"That Trash had a sister that looked much like yours. She was kidnapped by the Hakuko and is still missing." (Naofumi)<br/>
"Wha-" (Fohl)<br/>
"So perhaps you guys are the children of that sister, is what he’s thinking. Can you remember anything?" (Naofumi)<br/>
"Mother was… definitely human. Though she couldn’t see, she was always very kind." (Fohl)<br/>
"What was her name?" (Naofumi)<br/>
"Alucia" (Fohl)<br/>
A different person?<br/>
No, there’s the possibility that name is fake.<br/>
And I believe Trash’s sister’s name was Lucia. It’s only a letter extra.<br/>
"A little while after giving birth to Atlas, she got dragged into the war and died… She entrusted Atlas to me." (Fohl)<br/>
"I see… So you knew you were half-human?" (Naofumi)<br/>
"Yeah."(Fohl)<br/>
"What about your father?" (Naofumi)<br/>
"Why do I have to give you so much of my personal information!?" (Fohl)<br/>
"That’s true. But if I don’t know, there’s nothing I can do. I heard the Hakuko race was gathering quite a bit of power around Silt Welt. Since you’re under me, the Hero of the Shield’s protection, some of them may get jealous." (Naofumi)<br/>
"Uu… Understood. My father was… not someone who wished for fighting. He was a calm and kind person. Still, I get the feeling he was quite strong. In order to allow his subordinates, me, and Atlas to escape, he stayed on the frontlines ‘til the end, decimating his enemies." (Fohl)<br/>
"So you lost both of your parents in that war." (Naofumi)<br/>
"Yeah… but that was quite a while ago." (Fohl)<br/>
Fohl’s age shouldn’t be that high.<br/>
He looked to be around 12 when I met him, so I guess if he says a long time ago, it would by 6 years ago at max.<br/>
I don’t know the details, but it seems this world is filled with wars.<br/>
Due to Trash’s leadership, it seems Melromark was able to avoid quite a few of them, apparently.<br/>
Using Witch’s age as a basis, does that mean they’ve been at peace for around 20 years?<br/>
I don’t know what sort of position his grandfather took in Silt Welt, but he was supposed to be famous.<br/>
His troublesome legacy surrounds me.<br/>
"I have to protect Atlas, even if it kills me." (Fohl)<br/>
"And that sister of yours seems to be yearning for a scoundrel like me. Do a better job at it." (Naofumi)<br/>
"… You really have no interest in Atlas?" (Fohl)<br/>
"No matter how I answer, you’ll get mad. What answer do you want?" (Naofumi)<br/>
"Uu…" (Fohl)<br/>
"Is what I’d like to say, but I have no interest in love. Atlas is… let’s see… If I had to choose, I’d say she’s like a child to me." (Naofumi)<br/>
Like I think of Raphtalia as a daughter, Atlas is like an adopted daughter who forcefully tries to approach me.<br/>
I’m getting the same feeling from the village’s slaves as well as of late.<br/>
But at the moment, I don’t seem to have any emotions like love in me.<br/>
"Aren’t you in a similar position? Do your best to protect her and get strong enough as not to lose to her. Though, since I’m raising you to combat the wave, I probably shouldn’t be saying such things." (Naofumi)<br/>
"I’ll do it even without your input! I’ll beat down anything that comes in my way, so Atlas won’t have to fight." (Fohl)<br/>
"Yes, yes. Then, as you wish, I’ll think of a way to make it so Atlas doesn’t have to fight in the wave." (Naofumi)<br/>
"Hah?" (Fohl)<br/>
Fohl seems taken aback.<br/>
"What’s so strange? I won’t take anyone who doesn’t want to fight onto the front lines, and it’s not like I’ll ignore people who say they don’t wish for battle. You don’t want Atlas to be thrown into dangerous battles, right?" (Naofumi)<br/>
Though I’m the one putting Atlas through a lot of danger in the first place. Even so, if Fohl wishes for it, I could prevent her from participating.<br/>
"Are you sure that’s okay?" (Fohl)<br/>
"Only if you work hard enough to cover her share as well." (Naofumi)<br/>
"…" (Fohl)<br/>
Fohl answers with silence.<br/>
"Well, the individual may wish to fight, so it’s your job to stop her then. I won’t pressure her decision." (Naofumi)<br/>
"Got it." (Fohl)<br/>
He gives a strangely honest reply.<br/>
"I think I kinda understand the reason Atlas has… taken a liking to you. But I still hate you." (Fohl)<br/>
"Can it. Anyways, you need to try to stop your sister’s recklessness now." (Naofumi)<br/>
"…" (Fohl)<br/>
"Then I’m sleeping. If they try to come in, make sure to drive them out." (Naofumi)<br/>
And like that, the night quietly descends.<br/>
As expected, Atlas and Sadina tried to intrude, and Raphtalia and Fohl fought them… apparently.<br/>
This time, they were able to repel them quite quickly.<br/>
When I woke up, Raphtalia was sleeping next to me while holding my hand.<br/>
After apprehending Atlas, Fohl put her to sleep in her own room.<br/>
His sleeping face was that of a man who had overcome the greatest obstacle of his life.<br/>
"Tomorrow, I’ll be the one on top!" (Sadina)<br/>
"Niichan will prevent Atlas from walking on the wrong path!" (Fohl)<br/>
And the next day, they fought again.<br/>
<br/>
