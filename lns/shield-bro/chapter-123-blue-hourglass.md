<br/>
Kingdom is too good, I just finished the war against Wei arc and am taking a break. (No spoilers please)<br/>
Blue Hourglass<br/>
How many dead ends does this make now?<br/>
I check the map, and confirm that everything is mapped out……The road connected to the heart of the spirit turtle still hasn’t been found.<br/>
Naofumi:"Hmmmm……"<br/>
Sometimes we encounter familiars, but they aren’t a problem since Raphtalia and Firo are here.<br/>
Every time we come across a dead-end, we head back to where Rishia and the allied forces are to confirm it.<br/>
They encountered some familiars several times as well, but somehow they were able to defeat it with Rishia leading the way.<br/>
With those stats…… It’s thanks to the Firo costume<br/>
Naofumi:"Shit……"<br/>
As this continued, the spirit turtle approached human villages and we started getting impatient.<br/>
In the first place, this kind of cave, as long as the spirit turtle isn’t some artificial life form, shouldn’t the dungeon walls be made of meat?<br/>
I wonder. It feels like we haven’t even found the entrance yet.<br/>
Or is this cave itself a mistake?<br/>
According to the map this should be the bottom layer but……<br/>
Shadow:"Hero of the Shield-dono."<br/>
Shadow appears and updates my map.<br/>
……All the dead ends have been filled out.<br/>
Naofumi:"What happened? Was there a mistake in the legend?"<br/>
Shadow:"Not exactly degojaruka……But we have checked for hidden doors degojaru"<br/>
Firo:"Hey Master~"<br/>
Firo is having a good time kicking the ground.<br/>
Naofumi:"Can you check one more time? Or should I just go ahead and dig?"<br/>
A tool to dig will be necessary……That reminds me, I have a digging skill.<br/>
Firo:"Hey."<br/>
Shadow"The allied forces have already packed their luggage degojaru."<br/>
Firo:"Hey!"<br/>
Naofumi:"……What!?"<br/>
Firo is trying to get my attention by calling out.<br/>
Firo:"Umm you see. The floor……Isn’t it kind of strange?"<br/>
Firo rubs her foot and on the ground and hits it.<br/>
By the way, there are no echoes, and I even confirmed that there is no hidden floor.<br/>
Naofumi:"What’s strange about it?"<br/>
Firo:"It’s a living creature."<br/>
Naofumi:"Of course we’re inside the a mountain on the back of a giant monster."<br/>
Firo:"That’s not it!"<br/>
Firo smacks her foot on the floor again.<br/>
The floor ripples with a boing sound.<br/>
Naofumi:"Hm?"<br/>
That sound……It was strange.<br/>
Come to think of it……That strong acid water from the intermediate class recipes that I wasn’t able to make before should be suitable here.<br/>
I recall exactly how, and make it with my shield.<br/>
Naofumi:"Firo stay back a little."<br/>
Firo:"Okay~"<br/>
I take the strong acid water from the shield and pass it to Raphtalia.<br/>
Naofumi:"Scatter that."<br/>
Raphtalia:"Ah, Okay."<br/>
Raphtalia scatters the strong acid water on to the ground.<br/>
Spirit Turtle:"———!"<br/>
The floor wriggles and reveals its true form!<br/>
The mucus bodied huge eyeball opens up like mochi, and a turtle shell appears in its place.<br/>
(Tlnote: Mochi is a japanese rice cake. As for what’s happening, it’s like this http://imgur.com/EH3CyDz but with a giant eyeball (ew))<br/>
Shadow:"I see, so it is a mimic type familiar degojaruka, no wonder we couldn’t find it degojaru."<br/>
Naofumi:"Since it was dormant, it didn’t show any signs of being alive, so that’s why we were never able to sense it."<br/>
To think that even Shadow and Firo couldn’t sense it…….What a splendid cheat-like familiar.<br/>
Naofumi:"Kill them!"<br/>
Firo:"Okay~"<br/>
Raphtalia:"Roger!"<br/>
Shadow:"I too shall go degojaru!"<br/>
Every attack on a mimic type familiar kills it.<br/>
The mimic type familiars shrink like a slug and then disappear into vapor when they die.<br/>
Shadow:"So the path was concealed in such a place degojaruna."<br/>
When we confirm the disappearance of the last familiar, a path appeared.<br/>
That means, all dead ends up until now are doubtful.<br/>
That being said, let’s proceed down this path first.<br/>
Naofumi:"Let’s go."<br/>
All members nod and follow me.<br/>
After advancing a little, I felt the wall, temperature, and air change.<br/>
The wall itself is warm and pulsating.<br/>
Firo:"This feels strange."<br/>
Raphtalia:"That’s right……I feel a little sick."<br/>
Firo:"Does Firo’s mouth feel the same?"<br/>
…….What an unpleasant thought.<br/>
It does seem like Firo to say something like that huh?<br/>
Naofumi:"I wonder if we entered the spirit turtle’s body."<br/>
It still feels like a cave though, but it’s for real now.<br/>
Our foothold is squishy, and pulsing could be heard.<br/>
Anyway,let’s verify where the heart is.<br/>
Thinking about it, the demons and white clumps flying towards us are like platelets under a microscope.<br/>
(Tlnote: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Platelet )(Tlnote2: as for the white clumps 白い塊 I googled it and I lost my appetite.)<br/>
Thanks to my meteor shield repelling them , Raphtalia and Firo were able to kick them around.<br/>
Apparently, these familiars appear to be the immune system.<br/>
Every now and then, parasite-like caterpillar would appear, spreading potent acid wherever they go.<br/>
Naofumi:"It would seem that bringing the allied forces here would be hard."<br/>
The demons appear quite frequently. Since we are getting close to the heart, the defense would be stronger.<br/>
Shadow:"Shall I return and guide them here degojaruka?"<br/>
Naofumi:"No, we haven’t found the heart yet. In the first place, there is no conclusive evidence that this is the correct path either. We’ll get to where it’s at and clear it out."<br/>
Shadow:"Understood degojaru."<br/>
As we advanced forwards a little, a red muscle dangling from something is blocking our path.<br/>
…….Either way, a gimmick of this kind will just be cut open.<br/>
Naofumi:"Raphtalia, cut through it."<br/>
Raphtalia:"Ah, Okay."<br/>
Raphtalia cuts the red muscle.<br/>
The wall of meat opens up and a path appears.<br/>
Shadow:"Houu……You understand it well degojaruna."<br/>
Naofumi:"I don’t know about the other heroes, but frankly that muscle was suspicious…… I do know a few things you know."<br/>
Shadow:"So that’s how it is degojaruka."<br/>
Now then, after advancing a bit, what blocked our way this time is a blue muscle.<br/>
Haah……Even if you change it a bit, the path is still here.<br/>
Naofumi:"Raphtalia"<br/>
Raphtalia:"Okay!"<br/>
After cutting it down in the same fashion, the path in front opens up, but the red muscle behind us is restored.<br/>
Uggh. So troublesome.<br/>
Furthremore, just like a warning, every time we cut down a muscle, demons from the immune system appear.<br/>
Though……We advanced quite far…….<br/>
We heard the beating of a giant heart from behind a door.<br/>
After cutting open a blue muscle we found it.<br/>
However, after seeing the inside, the double doorway in front of us closed.<br/>
That’s troublesome, it seems that unless we cut somewhere else, this won’t open completely.<br/>
Naofumi:"As if I’d let you! Raphtalia, cut the red tube!"<br/>
Raphtalia:"O-Okay!"<br/>
After cutting open the red one, the inner part of the door opened……I rush forwards while deploying the meteor shield.<br/>
Naofumi:"Firo! There should be another muscle somewhere, tear it up!"<br/>
Firo:"Mkay!"<br/>
The meteor shield makes a cracking sound.<br/>
It seems the attack outside was more concentrated.<br/>
After Firo checks the area, she uses Spiral ・ Strike to tear apart the muscle on the wall, and that causes massive bleeding.<br/>
Spirit Turtle:"———!"<br/>
I heard a voice that could be from the heart in the interior.<br/>
It was probably painful.<br/>
Regeneration……Seems like it’s trying.<br/>
Do we have 30 seconds?<br/>
Naofumi:"Let’s go!"<br/>
Raphtalia:"Okay!"<br/>
I advance through the path opened to the heart.<br/>
After a while I discover a white muscle. The rear opened when it was cut.<br/>
Ha! Obediently let me conquer you!<br/>
Naofumi:"Shadow, if continuing through this place is the path, then it is your duty to report it."<br/>
Shadow:"Understood deojaru. Do you want me to carry out the order now degojaruka?"<br/>
Naofumi:"No, After a little more."<br/>
Before long, an out-of-place blue building came into view……<br/>
It was a blue Hourglass of the Dragon’s Era.<br/>
The size of it is smaller than the hourglass in Melromarc. It’s just that it exerts a somewhat light presence inside the body of the spirit turtle<br/>
Naofumi:"Hourglass of the Dragon’s Era……?"<br/>
Raphtalia:"It’s blue."<br/>
Shadow:"That’s right degojaruna."<br/>
Firo:"There’s less sand."<br/>
Right, as Firo said, there is less sand in this blue Hourglass of the Dragon’s era compared to the other one.<br/>
Firo:"Also, what are those letters of there~?"<br/>
In the middle of the Hourglass of the Dragon’s Era, written not with letters of this world, is a familiar character, the number 7.<br/>
What on earth could it be?<br/>
Also on the hourglass……. there are marks similar to a scale<br/>
The whole thing seems to only have about 1/10th of its quantity left.<br/>
I try to gently touch it.<br/>
And my hand slips through, it seems I won’t be able to touch the blue hourglass.<br/>
Something is different about this Hourglass of the Dragon’s era from the country’s.<br/>
That one has the function of informing us when the next wave will appear and Class up, but I don’t understand what this can do.<br/>
Naofumi:"There’s no use worrying. Our first priority is to confirm it."<br/>
Raphtalia:"Okay!"<br/>
Naofumi:"It will be fine to investigate it later."<br/>
Firo:"Okay~"<br/>
After advancing past the blue hourglass for a little, we discover the heart.<br/>
Its magnitude was more than 6 meters, the heart is divided into two different colours.<br/>
Naofumi:"So this is the heart of the spirit turtle huh."<br/>
Shadow:"Looks that way degojaruna. It’s a very ominous creature degojaru."<br/>
An eye direct’s its gaze towards our voices.<br/>
No matter how you look at it, that is not a welcoming gaze.<br/>
Spirit Turtle:"———!!"<br/>
Do we seal this guy?<br/>
*Pew, light hits the meteor shield and is reflected off.<br/>
(TLnote: ジュッ I have no idea, but it’s light so I’ll just go with pew)<br/>
Furthermore, a high-powered laser is discharged from the eye.<br/>
The eye on the heart of the spirit turtle opens wide and vibrates.<br/>
Familiars of the spirit turtle appear out of nowhere.<br/>
What a troublesome opponent. It’s not necessary for us to fight it, we’ll have to group up with the allied forces to come and seal it.<br/>
It can probably call an unlimited amount of familiars.<br/>
Naofumi:"Should we weaken it for now? Shadow go back."<br/>
Raphtalia:"Okay!"<br/>
Firo:"Mkay!"<br/>
Shadow:"Understood degojaruyo."<br/>
Raphtalia and Firo jump out from the barrier and attack the heart of the spirit turtle.<br/>
Both of them can’t help but unleash their respective finishing moves.<br/>
Raphtalia:"Yin-Yang Sword!"<br/>
Firo:"Critical Quick~"<br/>
Both their attacks hit the eye of the spirit turtle’s heart.<br/>
Spirit Turtle"——–!!"<br/>
Hey hey, it’s raging it’s raging. The vicinity around us vibrates.<br/>
A huge magic formation develops on the heart of the spirit turtle.<br/>
It seems to be doing something.<br/>
Naofumi:"Raphtalia, Firo, get back."<br/>
Raphtalia:"Roger."<br/>
Firo:"Okay~!"<br/>
Both of them fall back within the range of the meteor shield as I prepare for the attack.<br/>
The spirit turtles heart shoots……. a black ball of magic at me.<br/>
I receive it.<br/>
The meteor shield shatters like glass.<br/>
When the black ball hits the shield and light is distorted.<br/>
My body is heavy!<br/>
This magic is super gravity.<br/>
My body feels incredibly heavy.<br/>
However, my defensive power won’t be suppressed by something of this degree!<br/>
Naofumi:"Deryaaaaaaaa!"<br/>
I divert the ball of light to the right, and the ball of supergravity is repelled.<br/>
As expected, I won’t be hit with something as powerful as that electric attack from outside.<br/>
Well, that’s what it feels like. I don’t think the spirit turtle would do something that would destroy its own heart.<br/>
And so, the tube streaming around the spirit turtle’s heart is anaylzed……Some kind of white spirit is circulating through it.<br/>
It is scattered around the room centering from the heart.<br/>
Naofumi:"Meteor Shield!"<br/>
I once again put up the meteor shield.<br/>
…….I should receive it, once……what kind of attack is it?<br/>
I must receive it to analyze it….. Though for now I should be careful.<br/>
Naofumi:"Alright, we’re not going to fight now. We’ll withdraw and bring the allied forces here."<br/>
Shadow:"Roger degojaru."<br/>
We postpone the battle against the spirit turtle’s heart and withdraw.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
