<br/>
To make up for the other chapter.<br/>
And because people were asking for a photo:<br/>
<br/>
Anyone recognise the series?<br/>
I’m not gonna say which one I am, but it’s not the obvious one.<br/>
P.S. There weren’t any traps, at least not in this photo, nor among the cosplayers for the day.<br/>
P.P.S. For those in the know: Please join SMACK!~ [Totally advertising here, not that I actually profit from it. Mr Club President should thank me (I know he reads this!).]<br/>
Bird Competition<br/>
"Instead, I think Japanese clothing like Hakama and such would suit Raphtalia more." (Naofumi) [T/N: Think typical shrine maiden costume]<br/>
"Hakama? What do you mean by Japanese clothing?" (Imia)<br/>
Imia asked, tilting her head.<br/>
Because she usually specialises in Western dressmaking, she has an interest in this unknown genre.<br/>
 "Er.. Japanese clothing also encompasses the Loincloth that Sadina recommended to Kiel." (Naofumi)<br/>
"Ah, so you mean Eastern clothing. In that case, should I investigate and make some?" (Imia)<br/>
"That’s right….. since it will probably look good, let’s request it." (Naofumi)<br/>
 Raphtalia in Japanese clothing, huh.<br/>
"I understand. I’ll make it later. Do you have any preference for the materials?" (Imia)<br/>
"It’s not being used for battle so it’s fin… no, I’d like you to use quality materials to make it if you can. I’ll be waiting." (Naofumi)<br/>
"Oka~y." (Imia)<br/>
Imia finished talking with me and started serving another customer.<br/>
Raphtalia in Japanese clothing, huh…..<br/>
"Abstain from having a wooden umbrella, unrefined sake and leaves as clothing." (Naofumi)<br/>
That could be passed off as a joke if she was still around 5 years old, but letting Raphtalia wear that kind of outfit now would be a crime.<br/>
"Why is it that sort of concept, Naofumi-sama!" (Raphtalia)<br/>
Well Raphtalia is a Tanuki….<br/>
So Shigaraki Ware only exists in my country. [T/N: Pottery & stoneware made in Shigaraki, Japan. Tanuki figures are a popular product.]<br/>
I don’t really know if Shigaraki Ware has Female Tanuki though.<br/>
Now, how should I pacify Raphtalia.<br/>
"Ah, Naofumi-sama." (Atla)<br/>
"Why are you here!?" (Fohl)<br/>
 I was wondering who Imia was serving, but it turned out to be Atla and Fohl.<br/>
"Is it bad that I’m here? More than that, what are you guys doing?" (Naofumi)<br/>
"I have been searching for Naofumi-sama." (Atla)<br/>
"Atla! Don’t approach him!" (Fohl)<br/>
"So, Fohl. What are you doing?" (Naofumi)<br/>
"He has been choosing clothes for Atla-san." (Imia)<br/>
Imia replied.<br/>
In her hand was a cute dress and accessories.<br/>
So he’s already bought them.<br/>
"In addition to that, he has commissioned some custom-made items. He’s requested cute clothes and stuffed toys." (Imia)<br/>
"I see, I see." (Naofumi)<br/>
As usual, he’s been trying to turn his sister into a dress-up doll.<br/>
"Clothes that are easy to move in are better though….." (Atla)<br/>
Atla announced ostentatiously.<br/>
Well, Gothic Lolita and other cute styles are indeed unsuited for battle.<br/>
Besides, a resolute-type like Atla probably doesn’t like them.<br/>
"Atla, you won’t be fighting, so it’s fine for you to be at ease. Because you’re still too young to be mobilised!" (Fohl)<br/>
"Even if you say that…." (Atla)<br/>
Atla facepalmed and then turned to Imia, looking troubled.<br/>
"Have you finished the underwear I wanted?" (Atla)<br/>
"Ah, yes. It’s an attractive pair of underwear."<br/>
….She took out a thin pair of underwear, adorned with pretty ornaments, that was more risqué than the pair she showed Raphtalia.<br/>
It was black.<br/>
However, the problem was that Atla had a child’s body and appeared to be around 10 years old, so there was a disparity, or whatever it’s called.<br/>
Or rather, Atla can’t see so why would she even want such a thing.<br/>
"Wh―" (Fohl)<br/>
Fohl became speechless.<br/>
I also feel the same way.<br/>
What does Atla intend on by wearing that!<br/>
"Stop it, Atla! Nii-chan will never approve of that kind of underwear!" (Fohl)<br/>
"Onii-sama." (Atla)<br/>
Atla grasped Fohl’s hand gently.<br/>
"The sister of your dreams doesn’t exist. Please look at the real me. I’m someone who would wear this kind of underwear and attack Naofumi-sama." (Atla)<br/>
"What are you saying!" (Raphtalia)<br/>
Raphtalia shouts with all her strength.<br/>
"Wah…." (Fohl)<br/>
Fohl looked away from Atla in disbelief and glared at me for some reason.<br/>
Why does it feel like I’ve stolen his lover?<br/>
I don’t need that kind of development.<br/>
"Right. Since you know my feelings of it being wrong, stop your sister’s rampage." (Naofumi)<br/>
"Gu… I get it. Nii-chan will make Atla return to normal." (Fohl)<br/>
"Do your best." (Naofumi)<br/>
"Don’t you say that! Now, Atla! We’re going to the next store, there’s still a lot of things we need to buy!" (Fohl)<br/>
"Ah, Naofumi-samaaaaaaa!" (Atla)<br/>
Don’t reach your arm out to me whilst still holding the underwear.<br/>
That just looks like you’re trying to give me the underwear.<br/>
"Atla-san is amazing." (Imia)<br/>
"Yeah." (Raphtalia)<br/>
Raphtalia and Imia gazed at the scene with a faraway look and nodded to each other.<br/>
Was it just in my imagination that they were looking as if it was dusk?<br/>
"….Maybe I should also buy some." (Raphtalia)<br/>
"What are you saying? I think normal underwear is fine for Raphtalia." (Naofumi)<br/>
"…..I understand Atla-san’s feelings now." (Imia)<br/>
Atla’s feelings?<br/>
While they were talking, I heard a somewhat noisy voice from outside the town.<br/>
If I’m not mistaken, that is where the hurriedly established grass racetracks that Taniko had sponsored were.<br/>
For the time being, Rato should be there, looking after the health of the monsters that we’re in the Filorial category.<br/>
‘Waaaaaaaaah!’<br/>
I could hear cheers and angry bellows.<br/>
That was the mix of voices rejoicing their victory and the cries of defeat.<br/>
It was a little noisy but it might be good for improving Raphtalia’s mood.<br/>
"Let’s go look at the racetracks." (Naofumi)<br/>
"Ah, wait a minute." (Raphtalia)<br/>
When I look at the Filorial Racetracks, unknown Filorials and trainers hung their heads in defeat, and the Filorials from my place raised a victory cry.<br/>
As far as it goes, they were all guys who had changed into Filorial Queens and Kings.<br/>
Ah, Ren and Itsuki were keeping a lookout as guards.<br/>
"Kue." (Filorial)<br/>
The Filorials located me and ran over.<br/>
"""Kueee?" (Filorials)<br/>
You won? The Filorials faced me and held their heads high, seeming to say ‘Praise me, Praise me’.<br/>
"Yes yes, alright." (Naofumi)<br/>
It looks like this is the race under the command of Firo’s number one subordinate, the cutesy kid.<br/>
I don’t really want to address them but I stroke them anyway.<br/>
And the angry bellows from before were?<br/>
Or so I wondered but when I looked around, I saw visitors crying from losing their bets in the audience stands.<br/>
"That’s ridiculous! Our First Honor lost!?"<br/>
What’s with that horse-like name. [T/N: Racehorses have weird names.]<br/>
"Even our legendary Shield Lion! What’s with that!"<br/>
…..It seemed there were similarly named racehorse-like competitors everywhere.<br/>
"Are you these Filorials’ trainer!?" (Filorial Trainer)<br/>
The losing Filorials’ trainer approached me, who the Filorials had gathered around.<br/>
"If I’m not mistaken, you’re the lord of this land, the Hero of the Shield-sama." (Filorial Trainer)<br/>
"Yeah, that’s right?" (Naofumi)<br/>
"The Filorials from the Hero of the Shield-sama’s place are all excellent. By all means, would it be acceptable to let our Filorials breed with yours?" (Filorial Trainer)<br/>
"""Kue!?""" (Filorials)<br/>
The Filorials from my place raised their voices in surprise.<br/>
And then… I looked at the Filorials of the fellow who brought up the conversation.<br/>
When I do, it seems like the losing Filorials were looking this way with somewhat heated gazes.<br/>
"""KueKue!!""" (Filorials)<br/>
Everyone shook their heads and tried to hide behind my back.<br/>
Because there were so many of them, they weren’t hidden at all.<br/>
Or rather, imitating normal Filorials despite being able to talk is unnecessary. [T/N: Kueee!]<br/>
"Of course, we’ll provide a mating fee, so won’t you consider it?" (Filorial Trainer)<br/>
And then the trainer showed me how much he was willing to pay on an abacus-like tool.<br/>
….It’s a considerable amount of money.<br/>
From the audience stands came cries of ‘Ooh! Mating with those legendary Filorials!? That’ll be the start of a new legend!’, the audience holding their breath and watching attentively.<br/>
I want to nod along with the mood but…..you know.<br/>
I glance behind me.<br/>
When I do, all the Filorials had their wings together, praying for my refusal with eyes like a calf being sold off.<br/>
I see Rato and Taniko coming for a health check-up.<br/>
Rato shrugged casually and replied ‘And if the Marquis decides on his own?’<br/>
Taniko also said ‘Isn’t it fine if it turns out well?’ and nodded.<br/>
They knew just from experience.<br/>
"Ah…. I’m the person in charge for now but the one who raised them is someone different, and I also want them have their own freedom. For that kind of thing…..naturally….that…." (Naofumi)<br/>
Why are my words not coming out properly.<br/>
It’s because it’s not alright for me to arbitrarily decide on their engagement.<br/>
Also, they’re Filorials raised by Motoyasu, I never had the right.<br/>
However, it might be good to accept the breeding charge.<br/>
If thoroughbred Filorials are added to my subordinates then I’m sure our combat power will increase.<br/>
"""Kueeeee…..""" (Filorials)<br/>
Don’t cling to me, guys……<br/>
I heard from Melty that the opponent is quite a big organisation.<br/>
Are they financed by Zeltbur? Betting is nearly everywhere there, like in the Colosseum.<br/>
Refusing is also a pain, and the prospects sound good.<br/>
If possible, I want the Filorial bonding to have been unsuccessful already and be done with it.<br/>
"Somehow it seems like these guys aren’t interested. We can try to match my Filorials and your Filorials for a short time but if it doesn’t go well even then, will you give up?" (Naofumi)<br/>
And so we’re compromising.<br/>
"I understand." (Filorial Trainer)<br/>
Applause fills the racetracks.<br/>
It seems if it goes well, the Filorial Races get heated up.<br/>
"""Kueee…""" (Filorials)<br/>
The Filorials shake their heads in refusal.<br/>
I entered the ring and muttered so the other side couldn’t hear.<br/>
"Rest assured. It’s fine if you guys dislike it. It’s alright to send them flying if they approach against your will, as long as there are no injuries." (Naofumi)<br/>
"Kuee…" (Filorial)<br/>
"Also, I don’t think Motoyasu, who deeply cares for you guys, will swallow the story." (Naofumi)<br/>
Incidentally, well, this can also be said to the Filorials.<br/>
"There are those among you who aren’t that dissatisfied so please consider their feelings." (Naofumi)<br/>
There’s the main group who want to refuse and the group who doesn’t really care.<br/>
"It’s not like the whole group thinks the same. You guys have the initiative until the end. Understand?" (Naofumi)<br/>
"""Kue!""" (Filorials)<br/>
I don’t know if they understand, but the Filorials nod vigorously.<br/>
By the way, the Filorials’ breeding season lasts for a month.<br/>
The neutral group mate with the Filorials in custody, the birds that become renown later are a different story, and Motoyasu heroically fighting those Filorials is yet another story.<br/>
Well, the trouble with that later care was when some of the Filorials in custody lost their minds and decided to target Firo of all things.<br/>
Firo’s kicks were quite capable of paying barely-outrageous retributions.<br/>
They tried to chase the future queen and so they were just getting what they deserved though.<br/>
<br/>
