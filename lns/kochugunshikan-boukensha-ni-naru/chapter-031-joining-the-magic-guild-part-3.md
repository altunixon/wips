I stood behind a line facing several targets in the distance. I guess I’ll have to hold back a bit to avoid trouble.<br/>
I’ll go with Fire Ball first. Um, I need to close my eyes huh. I’ll wait for ten seconds before casting. Oops! I need to hold out my hand, right?<br/>
Fire Ball, fire!<br/>
The ball of flames hit the target right in the center.<br/>
"Eh!?"<br/>
Cara-san looked surprised. Did I miss something? Oh crap! I forgot to chant the spell name. I haven’t used it even once till now, so I completely forgot.<br/>
Well, what’s done is done. Let’s continue.<br/>
I cast Flame Arrow, Air Bullet, and Water successively. I properly made sure I took some time before casting the spells.<br/>
I refrained from chanting the spell names since it would be kind of pointless. It doesn’t look like it’ll be much of a deal, and chanting names like that is honestly a bit embarrassing y’know.<br/>
Cara-san was again surprised when I hit the target with the Water spell. Come to think of it, the water just spouted out limply from Cleria’s hand when she used it back then.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
That should be the correct usage of the spell.<br/>
I also refrained from casting my version of the Wind Cutter spell. It didn’t look like Elna’s version at all y’see. I’ll have to hide some things to avoid trouble after all.<br/>
"I’m finished."<br/>
"I’ve heard from Lily that you could also cast the Wind Cutter spell though."<br/>
"I’m still in the middle of learning it, actually. I’m not able to cast it successfully right now. I’m sorry."<br/>
"I see. I can also use the spell. Do you want me to show you?"<br/>
"No thank you. I do appreciate the sentiment, but I’d like to do it on my own for now."<br/>
"I see.<br/>
With that, the qualification exam is finished. To tell you the truth, you really surprised me with your performance. I didn’t think you were this skilled. You exercise an astonishing degree of control with your spells.<br/>
It’s very impressive, considering your age. You’ve already attained the qualifications for B rank, actually."<br/>
"Eh!? I’m all the way up to B rank?"<br/>
"The Magic Guild does not limit the maximum attainable rank during an exam to C, unlike the Adventurer’s Guild."<br/>
"Is that so. Thank you very much."<br/>
"No, I’m very glad to welcome such an outstanding talent like you to our Magic Guild. Alan-san, welcome to the Magic Guild."<br/>
"I’ll be in your care."<br/>
We went back to the Magic Guild office afterward to resume talks.<br/>
"Well then, let’s talk about your requests first. About the matter regarding the Heal spell; we’ll have to wait for an appropriate opportunity first. It’s not that simple to get ahold of an injured patient after all."<br/>
"Well, how about I cut my arm with my knife so you can heal it for me?"<br/>
"Alan-san, the Heal spell is certainly a spell used to treat injuries, but it’s not like it can completely cure wounds.<br/>
It can certainly heal up minor injuries like cuts and scratches.<br/>
However, since you’ll be paying money for the demonstration, I’d like to properly show you which injuries can be completely fixed up and which can’t, as well as to what extent Heal can fix the wounds."<br/>
"I see. That sounds better, I suppose. But you’re working part-time at a clinic, right?"<br/>
"H-How did you know something like that!?"<br/>
Lily quietly stood up and headed for the back room.<br/>
"Lily! Hold it right there! You just blurted out one of this branch’s most guarded secrets to a client!"<br/>
"You say it’s a secret chief, but everyone in town knows of it! I’m not at fault here!"<br/>
"I made it so they thought I was doing it as a volunteer, idiot!"<br/>
The chief held Lily’s head with both hands in an iron grip and kneaded it roughly.<br/>
"Gyaaa-! It huurts desu! I’m sooorry! I won’t say it anymore, I won’t dare say it chief!"<br/>
"You won’t end up lightly next time, y’hear."<br/>
"Understood!"<br/>
Both of them sat back down like nothing happened and resumed the talks.<br/>
"I can’t help it if you already know that much. By the way, the short course schedule would be four hours per day for twenty days. Are you alright with this, Alan-san?"<br/>
"I’d like it if the classes are done in the morning, if possible."<br/>
"It would be convenient for me as well if you want it scheduled in the morning."<br/>
"Eh? You’re going to be the one to teach me during the short course, chief?"<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
"Yes, that’s right. I was promoted to branch chief not just due to my magic skills, but my magic tool manufacturing skills as well.<br/>
Anyway, we’ll get in touch with you once a suitable patient comes to the clinic for treatment and show you the effects of the Heal spell then.<br/>
We have a frequent number of patients coming in, so I think you don’t have to wait long."<br/>
"That sounds great. Ah, can Ria and Elna watch as well…?"<br/>
"We both have already witnessed the Heal spell before Alan, so it’s alright if we don’t join this time."<br/>
"I see. Alright then. We’ll go with this arrangement. When will the short course start?"<br/>
"We can start tomorrow if you wish."<br/>
"Tomorrow then. What time will it be?"<br/>
"Let’s start at eight in the morning."<br/>
"Got it. Oh yeah, I haven’t paid the fees yet, right? Sorry."<br/>
I handed five gold coins for the short course fee and one large silver for the request fee.<br/>
"Thank you for your patronage. I’ve also yet to give you our Guild proof. Alan-san is a registered adventurer, right? Can you lend me your Guild identification for a bit?"<br/>
I took out my Guild identification from my pocket and handed it over. The branch chief took it to the back room.<br/>
We waited for about three minutes. The chief came out afterward and handed my identification back. It seems she placed the mark and seal of the Magic Guild at the back of my Adventurer’s Guild identification.<br/>
The details listed were like the ones from the Adventurer’s Guild. It had my registration number, date registered, and my rank indicated as B.<br/>
"This is quite nice. It saves me the hassle of walking around with two identity proofs. But how’d you finish it in just a few minutes?"<br/>
"I used a magic tool."<br/>
"But how about if my rank changed?"<br/>
"We can just erase your previous rank and place another. It’s quite an excellent magic tool. It fully takes advantage of the Magic Guild’s technical know-how."<br/>
"That sounds amazing! I’d like to see it too, if possible."<br/>
"Unfortunately, I can’t show it to you in order to prevent the spread of forgeries. It’s forbidden under the rules."<br/>
"I see. How unfortunate."<br/>
"I shall be waiting for you tomorrow then."<br/>
"Once again, I’ll be in your care."<br/>
We went out of the Magic Guild office and headed back to the inn.<br/>
"You scared me when you hit the target with the Water spell earlier, Alan."<br/>
"So the Water spell really isn’t used like that, huh."<br/>
"Absolutely not! It just simply produces water." Elna exclaimed.<br/>
"I see. But she told me to hit the targets though. Oh well.<br/>
I need to write down the recipes for Verse, so I’d like paper and a writing implement. I’ll get to use them for taking notes during the short course too.<br/>
Can we stop by Tarus-san’s store for a bit?"<br/>
"Of course, I don’t mind."<br/>
We went to Tarus General Store and found Tarus-san himself there.<br/>
"Oh, if it isn’t Alan-san. Welcome. Is there something you want?"<br/>
"I want to get some paper and a writing tool. Do you have them here?"<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
"Of course. They’re right over here."<br/>
Tarus-san showed me lots of kinds of quill pens and paper in a variety of sizes.<br/>
"Can you recommend an item for me?"<br/>
"Of course. This one should be good.<br/>
The ink is placed inside the pen itself.<br/>
It’s thicker than most quill pens, so it takes a little getting used to. But it would save you the trouble of continuously dipping it in an ink bottle, so it’s very convenient.<br/>
It’s a new product, and I’ve been using it as well. You’ll have to refill it with ink once it’s used up, however."<br/>
This is great! A normal quill pen was too thin for me. And I didn’t like the fact that I had to continuously dip it in an ink bottle to write.<br/>
"I’ll buy this. Please give me spare ink and a hundred sheets of paper of this size."<br/>
The pen and ink cost 500 Guineas. The paper costs the same as well. So the paper is five Guineas per sheet huh. I was expecting it, but it really was expensive.<br/>
We thanked Tarus-san and left the store. It’s already noon, so we decided to have our lunch at「Tally’s Restaurant」.<br/>
It looks like the menu changes per day, so the dishes we had were different from what we ate here before. They were all delicious as well. The amount of servings is a lot as usual, and Cleria seemed quite satisfied.<br/>
I went with Verse to the market in the afternoon. I’m really looking forward to seeing it.<br/>
