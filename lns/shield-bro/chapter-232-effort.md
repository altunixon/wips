Chapter 232: Effort<br/>
"This is… the village Naofumi-san built from the ground up. I am merely here to assist him. Welst-san, so you survived?" (Rishia)<br/>
"I find no joy in having found you like this. So you assisted in establishing this filthy Demi-Human village? That’s an insult. An act of rebellion towards all of the proud people of Melromark! I need to punish you!" (Welst)<br/>
The mage person begins chanting, and Kiel’s group’s injuries are healed.<br/>
Ah, he realized that his own half-assed magic would be useless against us.<br/>
Kiel and the others slowly pick themselves up off the ground like zombies.<br/>
… Perhaps because they’re not fully conscious yet, they sway back and forth as they walk.<br/>
But if we attack them anymore, I can’t guarantee the slaves’ safety.<br/>
"Where is Itsuki? Is this situation his doing?" (Naofumi)<br/>
"That fake who pretended to preach justice? Why would I speak with such a demon?" (Welst)<br/>
Fake who pretended to preach justice?<br/>
So there’s been a shift in the hierarchy of the group.<br/>
It seems they didn’t get along as well as I thought.<br/>
The possibility that they were working with Itsuki has decreased.<br/>
Itsuki may even be completely unrelated.<br/>
Though he’s probably the instigator of much of it.<br/>
"Please tell me! What happened to everyone and Itsuki-sama?" (Rishia)<br/>
"Why must I answer to evil!? Now then, my messengers of justice, rid this world of the source of evil!" (Welst)<br/>
In response to the mage’s shout, the slaves begin swarming around me.<br/>
"Messengers of justice, we’re going to chant Choral Magic!" (Welst)<br/>
「「「I who has understood the source…」」」 (Slave)<br/>
What?!? I feel the magic in the air gathering and solidifying.<br/>
I’ve heard a bit about Choral magic from Sadina and the Magic Shopkeeper, but it shouldn’t be something with an output this high.<br/>
Perhaps it is because all of their minds are thinking the exact same thing or that their chants are in perfect sync.<br/>
I prepare myself for a large impact.<br/>
"Please stop it now!" (Rishia)<br/>
Rishia appears right in front of the Mage person.<br/>
"Wha- So fast!" (Welst)<br/>
It’s a speed the past Rishia wouldn’t even have dreamed of.<br/>
This mage must have been imagining the old Rishia and underestimating her.<br/>
"However, with this, you will become my follower!" (Welst)<br/>
The mage faces Rishia and thrusts a glowing dagger at her.<br/>
"Your movements are too easy to read!" (Rishia)<br/>
Rishia easily dodges the attack and uses her own rapier to knock the dagger into the air.<br/>
"Damn… 「I who has…」" (Welst)<br/>
"「Zveit Elemental Blow!」" (Rishia)<br/>
Elemental magic… I believe it’s a synthesis of Fire, Water Earth and Wind magic. It’s apparently hard to control, and there are few people with the necessary magic attributes to use it.<br/>
A rainbow mass of light slams into the mage’s chest and sends him spinning into the ground.<br/>
It gives off a feeling like that Ninjutsu involving a sphere of wind. (TL: Rasengan from Naruto)<br/>
The Magic Shopkeeper tried hard to get Rishia to learn it. She said that there were very few people with the potential to use it.<br/>
But, it was the perfect magic for the Jack of All Trades, Rishia.<br/>
"How absurd… Could this be the extent of the Devil’s power?" (Welst)<br/>
"My power? No, this power is the accumulation of all of Rishia’s effort." (Naofumi)<br/>
It isn’t Stats.<br/>
Of course, stats always help, but Rishia put all of her being into getting as strong as she is now.<br/>
I won’t let you write it off as my power.<br/>
The mage who was the center of the Choral magic collapses, and the chant ends in failure.<br/>
However, that doesn’t mean the slaves’ attacks have stopped.<br/>
They begin attacking me with physical blows.<br/>
"If I use any more magic, Kiel and the others will be in trouble. What should I do?" (Sadina)<br/>
"They’ve gathered in such a small area. I can just capture them now." (Naofumi)<br/>
「Shield Prison!」<br/>
I activate Shield Prison with myself as the center.<br/>
"Ah… Uu…" (Naofumi)<br/>
I’m locked away in the dark cage with the slaves, but…<br/>
They’re still attacking me!<br/>
What’s the meaning of this?<br/>
That hurt! Don’t hit me there! Don’t stab me! It’s not piercing me, but the curse hurts!<br/>
…<br/>
And for the next 5 minutes, Kiel’s group treated me as a sandbag.<br/>
It seems that the Brainwashing Contagion doesn’t work on me.<br/>
At least that’s something to be happy about.<br/>
As the cage disappears, I find Atlas and the others watching us.<br/>
"Hm? Naofumi-sama, Kiel-san and the others aren’t returning to normal?" (Atlas)<br/>
"That seems to be the case. Can you identify the cause?" (Naofumi)<br/>
I cast healing magic on myself as I start dodging the attacks.<br/>
"The power influencing their actions from the outside was cut off by Naofumi-sama’s cage… but the second the cage disappeared…" (Atlas)<br/>
I see… So if it’s just one person like Imya’s uncle, I can save them, but it’s impossible for this large group.<br/>
If one of the candles goes out, the other ones will simply relight it. Something like that.<br/>
The sinister powers encircling the brainwashed form a spider-web like structure in between them while in the cage.<br/>
That’s why I can’t dispel the brainwashing on a group.<br/>
This is truly a pain.<br/>
I guess we’ll have to deal with that guy first. He seems to be the cause anyways.<br/>
"Our first priority should be to draw information from that man. Can you get these guys off of me?" (Naofumi)<br/>
"Yes~… Can I be a little rough?" (Sadina)<br/>
"No more lightning." (Naofumi)<br/>
"I know." (Sadina)<br/>
On Sadina’s signal, the aquatic Demi-Human slaves rise from the water.<br/>
Now that I think about it, they were living in the ocean with her.<br/>
And they begin chanting Choral Magic. And… For some reason, the unaffected slaves begin backing off.<br/>
"Naofumi-chan." (Sadina)<br/>
"What?" (Naofumi)<br/>
"I’m sorry. Grit your teeth for a second." (Sadina)<br/>
"Wai-" (Naofumi)<br/>
「「「Choral Magic! Daidal Wave!」」」<br/>
(TL: This is a pun. Dai is big in Japanese, so they mixed Dai with Tidal Wave)<br/>
This is that. What Witch was trying to do while she was testing the limits of the Slave Seal.<br/>
The target of the attack isn’t me, but the swarm of slaves surrounding me.<br/>
"Gyaaaaaaaa!" (Naofumi)<br/>
Upon the chant’s completion, a Tsunami rises and washes away everything in its path. Including me.<br/>
The world spins around me, and I can’t breathe.<br/>
As I think about it, Sadina steps into the wave and drags me out.<br/>
"It’s a bit like a defensive wall of water, but the duration has been shortened and the impact has been increased to make it an offensive magic." (Sadina)<br/>
"Won’t they die?" (Naofumi)<br/>
"No, don’t worry about that. I controlled the output." (Sadina)<br/>
Just as Sadina said, the water is only covering a limited area.<br/>
The village’s buildings aren’t damaged.<br/>
The effect time was probably around 90 seconds. After which, the large wave of water disappeared as if it had never existed.<br/>
The only things left were the bodies of the brainwashed slaves collapsed on the floor.<br/>
"Now then, everyone tie them up so they can’t move." (Sadina)<br/>
‘Why have you become the leader,’ is what I wanted to say, but I don’t have the energy to do so.<br/>
And then…<br/>
"Now spill everything." (Naofumi)<br/>
I speak to the tied-up former comrade of Itsuki.<br/>
"Why must I answer to Evil?" (Welst)<br/>
"You know… Do you know who you’re directing your words at?" (Naofumi)<br/>
I have quite a bit of confidence in my psychological torture skills.<br/>
Firo isn’t here, but there are still plenty of Filo Rials here.<br/>
"Even if I were to die here, that would just be a sacrifice for the sake of justice." (Welst)<br/>
"Justice… is it?" (Naofumi)<br/>
Doesn’t this man have anything else on his mind?<br/>
He’s acting like those annoying knights of the Three Heroes’ Church.<br/>
But I guess he’s of a similar type.<br/>
"Rishia, what sort of person is he?" (Naofumi)<br/>
"Um, among the companions in service to Itsuki, he’s been there the longest." (Rishia)<br/>
Ah, so he was there when no one wanted to be my companion.<br/>
I no longer feel any mercy.<br/>
Though I never really had any from the beginning.<br/>
"And I’ve heard that his family was nobility within Melromark." (Rishia)<br/>
"Were they related to your family?" (Naofumi)<br/>
"They were in different territories. There are quite a few noble families in Melromark." (Rishia)<br/>
Well that sounds about right. As long as there wasn’t a large-scale event, I guess they would never meet. What’s more, Rishia’s a fallen noble.<br/>
He must have used a few of his connections to get himself into the Heroes’ starting party.<br/>
Just like the princess mixed in among them.<br/>
Does that mean some seditious nobles are backing him?<br/>
I turn my gaze to the suspicious dagger the mage held.<br/>
I can’t appraise it. It’s quite a suspicious item.<br/>
I wonder what it is.<br/>
"Rishia." (Naofumi)<br/>
"What is it?" (Rishia)<br/>
"Use this to stab him." (Naofumi)<br/>
"Fueee!?" (Rishia)<br/>
Rishia reveals a surprised face as I turn her on her former comerade.<br/>
However, the mage’s face is even paler.<br/>
He’s turning blue.<br/>
"Stop! Don’t turn that thing on me!" (Welst)<br/>
"So you can use it on others, but the reverse is forbidden? You’re quite a selfish fellow." (Naofumi)<br/>
I should begin threatening him.<br/>
This weapon is definitely related to the brainwashing.<br/>
Looking at it closely, it has a strange gem embedded into it.<br/>
"Atlas, can you feel anything from this?" (Naofumi)<br/>
"Yes, from the weapon Naofumi-sama is holding, a sinister aura is being emitted." (Atlas)<br/>
"I see." (Naofumi)<br/>
There’s no doubt.<br/>
If this stabs him, he will be corrupted by Justice.<br/>
"Well, Rishia? This is a good opportunity to get back at the guy who planted false charges on you and got you kicked out." (Naofumi)<br/>
"Fueee….." (Rishia)<br/>
Rishia wears a troubled expression and shakes as she approaches the mage one step at a time, dagger in hand.<br/>
So she’s really going to do it.<br/>
"Stop it! Don’t get any closer! The hammer of justice will punish all evil!" (Welst)<br/>
"Yeah, that’s right. You’re evil, and I’m justice. And Rishia is the hammer that’ll punish you." (Naofumi)<br/>
"Evil should stay silent!" (Welst)<br/>
"I’m fine with evil. But you will be the one yielding to such evil. How unfortunate. Where is your justice now?" (Naofumi)<br/>
I wonder just how deeply the belief that he is justice is embedded in his head.<br/>
Even if we stab him, I’m not sure he’ll even change at all…<br/>
I guess I should at least dispel the brainwashing on Kiel.<br/>
I drink a mana potion and enclose Kiel in my Shield Prison.<br/>
"Fue…" (Rishia)<br/>
"If you don’t want that dagger in your ribs, then spill out your guts." (Naofumi)<br/>
<br/>
