Chapter 53 <br/>
 <br/>
Iron Maiden <br/>
 <br/>
Red Dragon Flame...... The Shield of Anger 2 that was changed by a black shadow. <br/>
 <br/>
"Uooooooooooooo!" <br/>
 <br/>
When I shout the air vibrates, it's as if the world resonated with me. <br/>
 <br/>
"What......" <br/>
 <br/>
The enemy stops fighting Firo and looks at me with a loss for words. <br/>
Just like the first time it is extremely dangerous to hold the Shield of Anger, it is trying to consume my heart. <br/>
The shield's anger has increased......Is this the result of my upgrades? <br/>
Damn...... My view is warped. <br/>
 <br/>
"Naofumi-sama" <br/>
 <br/>
Suddenly, I feel a gentle touch. <br/>
It is probably Raphtalia. <br/>
I.....I will not lose here. <br/>
I shake the black shadow off and restore my vision. <br/>
And I look the enemy straight in the eye. <br/>
 <br/>
"U......Uuaaaa" <br/>
 <br/>
What!? <br/>
When I look at Firo I feel a strange resonance with her.....The flame from my shield stays on Firo without burning her. <br/>
 <br/>
"Gaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa!" <br/>
 <br/>
Firo sharpens her eyes like a bird of prey and kicks the enemy. <br/>
Is this due to the Dragon Core that was absorbed by the shield? <br/>
 <br/>
"W-What is going on. This is even heavier than before......" <br/>
 <br/>
The enemy is in dismay due to Firo's attacks <br/>
But, I can't tell if Firo is self-aware or not, all I can see in her eyes is rage in violence for the enemy. <br/>
 <br/>
"What happened." <br/>
 <br/>
The enemy approaches and asks. <br/>
 <br/>
"Oh, It's my trump card." <br/>
 <br/>
I still have my ego. <br/>
It's going to be alright. I did not yield to anger because there was someone who will believe in me. <br/>
I provoke the enemy despite all the cold sweat. <br/>
I also instruct Raphtalia with my eyes to stay away. <br/>
 <br/>
"Are you okay?" <br/>
"Yeah, I can still restrain it." <br/>
 <br/>
I approached the enemy <br/>
 <br/>
"Uaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa" <br/>
 <br/>
Special Effect, Roar. <br/>
It is probably something that increases the vibrations in the air. <br/>
 <br/>
"Gaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa!" <br/>
 <br/>
In response to my roar, Firo recklessly charges the enemy with me. <br/>
 <br/>
"Damn......" <br/>
"Don't dodge please!" <br/>
"As If I'd do that!" <br/>
 <br/>
While the enemy is dealing with Firo using her iron fan. I also enter the fray. <br/>
Gagin! <br/>
Alright, the attack is lighter compared to when I had the Chimeric Viper Shield. <br/>
In this case it is not necessary to hunker down. <br/>
 <br/>
The fire from the Curse revolves around me. <br/>
According to my anger, the heat increases or decreases. <br/>
If I don't keep my anger in check, then the fire power would be extrodinary. <br/>
But, as for the flames, the power of the curse is still in there. <br/>
 <br/>
"What!?" <br/>
 <br/>
When Firo dived recklessly through my flames she falls to the ground instantly. <br/>
Good! <br/>
The black flame will take down the enemy. <br/>
 <br/>
"But......It's not an attack that I cannot endure." <br/>
 <br/>
.....Though she took my flames head on it wasn't fatal. <br/>
 <br/>
"Rinbu Yabu No Kata ・ Kikkō wari!" <br/>
(Tl note: 「輪舞破ノ型・亀甲割！」 If anyone's got anything better I'm all ears.) <br/>
 <br/>
The Iron Fan was retracted and came piercing towards me. It resembles an arrow. <br/>
Dangerous! <br/>
I ready my shield with that in mind. <br/>
Gatun, a heavy impact, and pain can be felt throughout the body. <br/>
My body was damaged through the shield <br/>
 <br/>
"Damn......" <br/>
"Hey, was I supposed to fall from that attack?......" <br/>
 <br/>
It is hard to stay calm from the pain. But if I lose my cool we all die here. <br/>
 <br/>
"It was quite a good attack" <br/>
 <br/>
That attack was probably meant for penetration, at least that's what it would do in games. <br/>
Even if defence is very high, it would be ignored and have no meaning. <br/>
There is also the possibility that it will do more damage the higher defence their opponent has. <br/>
Is this the weakness of the Hero of the Shield? <br/>
 <br/>
This is an old rule of thumb from net games, there are numerous ways to deal with any problem. <br/>
I do not know if my knowledge from those games apply to this world, but there are some-things that will always be true. <br/>
 <br/>
The enemy's offensive ability is simply too high while the shield is weak. <br/>
Next, avoid attacks. It is a common sense against enemies that use instant death attacks. <br/>
Finally, need some fire power. The way to overcome absolute offensive ability without dying is the role of a tank. <br/>
 <br/>
Until now, I tried to think of reasons that the shield is weak, but none of them really apply. <br/>
......I don't understand. <br/>
Anyway, I need to concentrate now. <br/>
 <br/>
Using Fast heal I cure myself. <br/>
I don't know whether or not the other party can heal, but I won't take any chances. <br/>
 <br/>
"I know the weakness of your attacks." <br/>
 <br/>
The enemy declares grandly. <br/>
 <br/>
"Your only attack is the black flame which is close range. It cannot attack me from a distance. And that also makes your roar useless." <br/>
 <br/>
Damn...... It hurts to be analysed <br/>
She is quite suitable as a warrior. Insight is great. It if were someone else, she would not lose. <br/>
If someone like her is part of the wave then won't it become a disaster? <br/>
 <br/>
"However, once I take out your companions you are have chance of winning from a distance!" <br/>
 <br/>
The enemy changes her aim to Firo <br/>
 <br/>
"Gaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa!" <br/>
"You think I'd let you!? <br/>
 <br/>
Damn, it takes too long to catch up since Firo and her are so fast. <br/>
Anything......Isn't there anything on hand I can use? <br/>
Then it hits me. <br/>
 <br/>
Change Shield (Attack) Iron Maiden <br/>
(Tl note: Author typo'd here,it's supposed to be  チェンジシールド but he wrote 　チェンジールド http://ncode.syosetu.com/n3009bk/53/  for confirmation if you want.) <br/>
It is the skill that comes with the Shield of Anger. <br/>
Doing a last all-or-nothing attack isn't too bad. <br/>
I think it was...... Shield Prison -> Change Shield (Attack) -> Iron Maiden. <br/>
This is probably a skill that can only be used by consecutively using different skills. <br/>
It might be a combination skill. <br/>
 <br/>
"Shield Prison" <br/>
 <br/>
I use the skill that surrounds the enemy within shields. <br/>
 <br/>
"Please don't think I'll be stopped so easily." <br/>
 <br/>
However, it is extremely difficult to catch an enemy that moves with this skill. <br/>
Damn, this is also dangerous for Firo since they are moving so recklessly. <br/>
I don't know if you will receive a fatal injury. <br/>
The cage disappears doing nothing and only the cool down time remains. <br/>
 <br/>
"Naofumi-sama, did you think of something?" <br/>
"Yeah, is there any way you can stop her from moving?" <br/>
 <br/>
It would be very dangerous, but it would give me the best chance of catching her within the cage. <br/>
 <br/>
"I understand. I'll do my best" <br/>
"W-Will you be alright?" <br/>
"I'll be fine. I can fight today thanks to Naofumi-sama." <br/>
 <br/>
Raphtalia takes a stance with her sword and concentrates. <br/>
Her tail is also standing up......Is she going to use magic? <br/>
 <br/>
"Match my timing because I'll stop her." <br/>
"Yeah!" <br/>
 <br/>
After some light appeared from her tail Raphtalia ran towards the enemy. <br/>
 <br/>
"Deryaaaaaaaaaaa!" <br/>
"To come from the front is truly foolish!" <br/>
 <br/>
An arrow of light that is the iron fan is fired towards Raphtalia. <br/>
But, Raphtalia dodges it by lowering her posture. <br/>
 <br/>
"Deei!" <br/>
 <br/>
The enemy was slashed at with the sword. <br/>
 <br/>
"You're full of openings!" <br/>
 <br/>
Raphtalia resumes her posture but is slashed by the enemy. <br/>
Su...... Raphtalia scattered and simmered into the air. <br/>
 <br/>
"What!?" <br/>
 <br/>
There is a fizzing sound. <br/>
Then, Raphtalia appears from behind the enemy and knocks her down. <br/>
 <br/>
"Now!" <br/>
"Got it!" <br/>
 <br/>
I respond to Raphtalia's instructions. Firo has already moved away since she can tell I am about to use a skill. <br/>
It seems she can be manipulated by the Shield of Anger. <br/>
 <br/>
"Shield Prison!" <br/>
"What--" <br/>
 <br/>
The enemy is caged by shields. <br/>
The cage seems to break at any moment due to her attacks. <br/>
Not happening. I will not let the chance that Raphtalia made go to waste. <br/>
 <br/>
"Change Shield (Attack)" <br/>
 <br/>
I shout the name of the skill. <br/>
The shields that are available to the changed to appears. <br/>
The shield which I chose is the Bee Needle Shield! <br/>
 <br/>
"--!" <br/>
 <br/>
The shields change and the inside is attacked. <br/>
An impact spreads throughout the cage. <br/>
Iron Maiden! <br/>
When I was about to shout the name of the skill, a sentence appears in my head. <br/>
 <br/>
"The foolish criminal will feel with their whole body the embrace of virgin iron in a single blow.Release a cry full of painful agony that will not be heard!!" <br/>
"Iron Maiden!" <br/>
 <br/>
A huge iron torture device known as the iron maiden appears as I chant and wraps around the cage.  <br/>
 <br/>
"------------!" <br/>
 <br/>
The cage of shield breaks and is confined by the iron maiden and pieced, not even the cry is let heard! <br/>
At the same time my Sp hits 0. <br/>
Th-this skill, does it use all of it's caster's SP as the sacrifice? <br/>
And the effect time of the Iron Maiden disappears. <br/>
 <br/>
"Gufu--" <br/>
 <br/>
With her whole body penetrated the enemy glares at me while breathing heavily. <br/>
 <br/>
 "I am very dissatisfied......But I have no choice but to withdraw for today......" <br/>
 <br/>
You can still stand after receiving such a skill? <br/>
 <br/>
"You think I'll let you escape!?" <br/>
"Ha!" <br/>
 <br/>
The enemy starts running towards the crack in the sky. When I look at Firo she doesn't seem to want to chase. <br/>
It seems Roar is necessary to order Firo to charge recklessly, but I cannot use it because I have no more SP. <br/>
We almost beat her. <br/>
 <br/>
"My name is glass..... You, what is your name?" <br/>
 <br/>
Before she entered the crack she turned around and pointed at me. <br/>
 <br/>
"Is it necessary for me to respond?" <br/>
"No it is not. But I want to remember the person who cornered me like this. That's it." <br/>
"As expected of a warrior, though there are a lot of things I want to know." <br/>
"Then, let me give the person who has the shield one piece of information." <br/>
 <br/>
What? What are you saying? <br/>
 <br/>
"It is a big mistake to think of me as a mere disaster.  But, it is not I who will win, It is the one beyond the boundary." <br/>
 <br/>
Hm.....This information is surely important. <br/>
I know nothing about what kind of thing a wave is. <br/>
Glass..... It is necessary to know the meaning of her words, but also about the meaning of the waves. <br/>
At least the enemy is an intellectual living entity. <br/>
I have been too obsessed with that Bitch Princess and Trash King. <br/>
The true enemy that we Heroes fight are these fellows from the wave. <br/>
 <br/>
Hm.....It seems I have enemies behind and in-front of me...... <br/>
 <br/>
"Understood. Thanks for the information, My name is Iwatani Naofumi." <br/>
"Naofumi...... I'll remember it!" <br/>
 <br/>
When Glass declares that and enters the crack it starts to disappear. <br/>
Shortly after it vanishes. <br/>
I immediately change Shield of Anger 2 to another shield. <br/>
Although that shield gives me a temporary Power Up I cannot use it for too long. <br/>
 <br/>
"Haah......" <br/>
"We did it." <br/>
"I guess." <br/>
"Funyaa...... Did something happen?" <br/>
 <br/>
Raphtalia just catches up to me as I turn around, and Firo falls to the ground in exhaustion. <br/>
 <br/>
"Was the wave settled somehow?" <br/>
"I think so" <br/>
"Firo is tired......" <br/>
"Is that so. Let's ignore the other heroes and go clean up." <br/>
 <br/>
Thus, the third wave in this world ended.
