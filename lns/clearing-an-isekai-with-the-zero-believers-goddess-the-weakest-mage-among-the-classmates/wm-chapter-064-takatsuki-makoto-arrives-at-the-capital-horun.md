<br/>
"That’s the capital of Rozes, Horun. The Rozes Castle towers at the middle of it." <br/>
The sight of it slowly got clearer and clearer from on top of the Flying Ship.<br/>
"It is surrounded by more than thousands of water fountains and flowers of varying sizes, and it is called the number one most beautiful castle of this continent." (Chris) <br/>
Christiana-san adds.<br/>
"But that rampart under construction doesn’t look good." (Aya)<br/>
Just as Sa-san said, the big wall under construction that surrounds the whole capital destroys the sight.<br/>
"Horun, which is one of the most prominent touristic locations of the continent, only has the minimum defense facilities, and they were mostly working in maintaining the scenery after all." (Fujiwara)<br/>
"But after receiving the oracle a few years ago that the Great Demon Lord will be reviving, the ramparts were hurriedly being reinforced." (Chris)<br/>
I see. <br/>
They do say that the monsters have gotten more active and wild. <br/>
Must be rough.<br/>
"Hey hey, when we arrive at the capital, where are we going?" (Lucy)<br/>
Lucy asks with excitement.<br/>
"First, I will go to the castle and greet the King." (Makoto)<br/>
"Isn’t there still time till the settled date?" (Lucy)<br/>
"It said come within 7 days, so I suppose it is okay to go sooner." (Makoto)<br/>
I want to finish up the problematic things fast.<br/>
I can leisurely explore the capital after that.<br/>
"Then, let’s go down." (Fujiwara)<br/>
Everyone nodded at Fuji-yan.<br/>
◇◇<br/>
—Flower Main Street<br/>
It is the main street that extends straight from the main gate of Horun all the way to the Rozes Castle.<br/>
Just as its name states, there’s many flowers blooming at the side of that path.<br/>
Brick buildings that remind me of the cityscape of Europe. <br/>
The street was crowded with people.<br/>
The people that were walking the path were of varying races: human, beastkin, elf, dwarves. From children to elderly.<br/>
Makkaren was similar, but the people here have a somewhat different atmosphere.<br/>
How to say it, they were polished.<br/>
Their clothing and the way they talk.<br/>
"It feels as if I went from the countryside to the city." (Makoto)<br/>
"Haha! The first time I came to the capital, I thought the same thing-desu zo." (Fujiwara)<br/>
Fuji-yan says while laughing.<br/>
"Hey hey.", Lucy pulls my sleeve.<br/>
What was there was…<br/>
"Ah…sorry, Christiana-sama." (Makoto)<br/>
Oops. The daughter of the feudal lord of Makkaren was here.<br/>
"It is okay. Compared to the capital, Makkaren could indeed be considered a countryside." (Chris)<br/>
She forgave me with a simple chuckle.<br/>
"Hey, what is that?" (Aya)<br/>
Nice, Sa-san. She diverted the topic.<br/>
What she pointed at was a big tent that was set at the plaza.<br/>
Indeed, what is that?<br/>
In our previous world, those kinds of tents were…<br/>
"That’s the monster tamers’ circus troupe. They are a group of performers that go around the continent." (Chris)<br/>
"I have seen it once before a long time ago, but it was quite the thing." (Fujiwara)<br/>
So it really is a circus.<br/>
So there’s in this world as well.<br/>
Is what I thought, but in this world, it is not people that do the performance, but taming monsters to make them do the performances.<br/>
The difference in those areas makes it an Isekai, huh.<br/>
"Ah, there’s a giant and a dragon!" (Lucy)<br/>
At the place Lucy points at, there’s a giant that’s around 10 meters tall, and also a dragon on the smaller side inside a cage.<br/>
"So you can tame dragons too, huh." (Makoto)<br/>
Monster tamers are incredible.<br/>
"No, that’s a wyvern. If there were a monster tamer that could tame a pure dragon, they wouldn’t be working in a circus trope but the country." (Chris)<br/>
Christiana-san tells me.<br/>
"But those monsters have accumulated stress." (Aya)<br/>
"You can tell, Sa-san?" (Makoto)<br/>
"Yeah, kinda." (Aya)<br/>
Some kind of link between monsters?<br/>
"The monsters in the circus trope originally attacked people, and would normally be killed, but the circus trope would buy them. Just that…the way they treat them is bad." (Nina)<br/>
So they are utilizing monsters that were originally supposed to be subjugated then.<br/>
If there were an organization for the ethical treatment of monsters, I feel like there would be complaints, but there’s most likely not.<br/>
"Anyways, this city really has a lot of flowers." (Lucy)<br/>
Looks like Lucy prefers the flowers over the circus.<br/>
She is looking at the flower beds and potted plants here and there.<br/>
"It is a beautiful city." (Makoto)<br/>
I truly think that. This is the flower capital.<br/>
"We will be arriving soon-desu zo. I will talk to the gatekeeper." (Fujiwara)<br/>
We always leave these areas to Fuji-yan.<br/>
I am really grateful to him.<br/>
We passed through the gate that was adorned artistically, and entered the Rozes Castle.<br/>
 ◇◇<br/>
 "Raise your heads." <br/>
After entering, we had an audience with the King of Rozes.<br/>
There were many people who had come to speak to the King, but when we arrived, we were placed as the top priority and let in.<br/>
It gave me a slight sense of superiority.<br/>
"I extend my gratitude for your contribution in the subjugation of the Taboo Dragon." <br/>
"The Laberintos City is an important asset of Rozes. We were saved by you heroes of the parallel world." <br/>
The King and Queen of Rozes were giving plain words of gratitude.<br/>
They asked me what I wanted between gold or peerage as a reward, and after thinking for a while, I answered: Gold.<br/>
Serving the royal family as a noble is a bit…<br/>
This is okay, right, Noah-sama?<br/>
(Do as you please, Makoto.) (Noah)<br/>
Looks like there’s no problem.<br/>
The King finished speaking, and at the end, Princess Sofia spoke.<br/>
"Takatsuki Makoto, Fujiwara Michio; this is the business permit for the Water Country that you requested. I have signed it under my name." (Sofia)<br/>
"Thank you very much." (Fujiwara)<br/>
Fuji-yan receives it with glee.<br/>
In the Water Country, the power of the nobles and the holy professions is strong.<br/>
Princess Sofia is the Oracle of the Water Goddess. <br/>
She is the person that is close to the top in regards to the nobles and holy professions.<br/>
Her sign apparently means a lot.<br/>
(Well, with this, we probably won’t be meeting again.) (Makoto)<br/>
I glanced up and…her ice cold eyes met with mine.<br/>
(Uwaah…she is glaring at me.) (Makoto)<br/>
I am really hated.<br/>
Princess Sofia continues her words.<br/>
"Merchant Fujiwara, if you so wish, we could grant you a peerage." (Sofia)<br/>
"Eh?" <br/>
The one who raised a voice of surprise at Princess Sofia’s words was Christiana-san.<br/>
"…No, this business permit here is plenty enough, Princess-sama." (Fujiwara)<br/>
In the end, Fuji-yan refused that.<br/>
And in this way, the audience ended.<br/>
Aah, it really stiffened my shoulders there.<br/>
◇◇<br/>
"Fuji-yan, why did you refuse the peerage?" (Makoto)<br/>
I was curious about it, so I tried asking.<br/>
"Because if I were to accept the peerage from Princess Sofia, I would have to live in the capital of Horun. Also, that was more of a preparation for you, Takki-dono, rather than me-desu zo." (Fujiwara)<br/>
"Eh? What do you mean?" (Makoto)<br/>
"She most likely investigated that you and I have formed parties together in Makkaren, and that we were doing business together too. It seems that her objective was to bind us to the Water Country-desu zo." (Fujiwara)<br/>
The latter part was in a low voice.<br/>
It seems like he read the mind of Princess Sofia.<br/>
So that was her intention, huh…<br/>
When I glanced to the side, I saw that Christiana-san was making a complicated expression.<br/>
What happened?<br/>
"Makoto, we are exploring the city!" (Lucy)<br/>
Lucy was pumped up.<br/>
But there’s something more important than exploring the city!<br/>
"No, first, let’s explore the castle." (Makoto)<br/>
It is the basics of RPGs.<br/>
This is my first castle since coming to this Isekai.<br/>
I will explore every nook and cranny!<br/>
"Takki-dono, wait." (Fujiwara)<br/>
"Takatsuki-kun, wait." (Aya)<br/>
Fuji-yan and Sa-san grabbed me from both sides.<br/>
"Eh?" (Makoto)<br/>
"You can’t break vases and check drawers, okay?" (Fujiwara)<br/>
"That’s a crime, okay? You must not search for hidden rooms or stairs, okay?" (Aya)<br/>
"…Eh? You can’t?" (Makoto)<br/>
N-No way… Wait, that’s obvious.<br/>
Of course you can’t.<br/>
Yeah, I knew.<br/>
Lucy, Nina-san, and Christiana-san had their mouths open wide.<br/>
"…Makoto?" (Lucy)<br/>
"No, I wouldn’t do that." (Makoto)<br/>
Aah, games are scary.<br/>
I was about to break the vases nearby and check the drawers. <br/>
(Haah…) <br/>
I could even hear the sigh of the Goddess. <br/>
What’s with everyone?<br/>
Treating me like a weirdo.<br/>
◇◇<br/>
Fuji-yan seemed to have been relieved that he stopped my eccentricities; he left to greet the companies of Horun.<br/>
Nina-san accompanied Fuji-yan.<br/>
Christiana-san seems to be going to greet the nobles of the capital.<br/>
She left with her attendants.<br/>
And so, just as I was thinking about exploring the city with the others…<br/>
"You bastard, is that you, Takatsuki Makoto?! Why are you here?" <br/>
I was suddenly called.<br/>
When I turned around, the one there was the former guardian knight of the Water Oracle.<br/>
Hm? Wasn’t he fired?<br/>
