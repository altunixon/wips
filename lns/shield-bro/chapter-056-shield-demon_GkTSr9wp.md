It's time for some Melty. <br/>
Chapter 56 <br/>
 <br/>
Shield Demon <br/>
 <br/>
"Let's continue peddling." <br/>
"I guess. Travelling expenses and the cost of weapons can get pretty expensive." <br/>
"I think so too." <br/>
"Though our food costs for a certain bird is the highest." <br/>
 <br/>
The Mileage to Food cost ratio on our bird is not negligible, but our horsepower is amazing. <br/>
Feeding a demon is ridiculous, the sheer quantity required is impossible to sustain. <br/>
So before all my money is consumed I need to earn more. <br/>
We should be fine selling things in the villages and towns we stay at. <br/>
While thinking so our treat begins. but...... <br/>
 <br/>
"I finally caught up!" <br/>
 <br/>
It is now evening. <br/>
The goddamn kid from the castle town caught up with us. <br/>
While peddling I decided on an inn. <br/>
 <br/>
"What a persistent brat." <br/>
"We haven't finished talking yet!" <br/>
"Whatever. It's about your father. So what?" <br/>
"So what!? You suck!" <br/>
 <br/>
The goddamn kid's face instantly turns red. Quite an emotional kid. <br/>
It's annoying and hysteric. <br/>
 <br/>
"My father is angry at the shield." <br/>
"I see, that's great." <br/>
"No it's not!" <br/>
 <br/>
This annoying brat. <br/>
After deciding on a place to stay the hotel charges are paid. I want to ignore her, but she is very persistent. <br/>
I wonder how far she intends to chase. I want to ask and make sure. <br/>
 <br/>
"What's wrong?" <br/>
 <br/>
Firo got bored of playing nearby and came back.By the way, even if a party member beats a demon far away I still get a little experience. <br/>
Sometimes all those minuscule experience gains block my view while peddling. <br/>
Though Firo brings me materials under the pretence of souvenirs. <br/>
 <br/>
"Ah......" <br/>
 <br/>
The goddamn kid stops and watches Firo again. <br/>
 <br/>
"Are you the Philo Rial that pulled the carriage?" <br/>
"Yeah, you understand." <br/>
"You are different from all the Philo Rial that I know of. It's my first time seeing one that looks like a child." <br/>
 <br/>
To be fair, only a few people have actually seen a Philo Rial Queen. We might be the only ones in the country. <br/>
 <br/>
"Master, did you need anything?" <br/>
"We are talking!" <br/>
"Start from the beginning." <br/>
 <br/>
Firo has been talking with her since they met. <br/>
 <br/>
"Shouldn't you be chirping?" <br/>
"Nope. Firo can speak words~" <br/>
"Wow......Awesome!" <br/>
"Ehehe I'm amazing." <br/>
 <br/>
The goddamn kid approaches Firo and touches her. <br/>
Firo doesn't seem to mind. <br/>
Oh their mental ages are probably similar.  <br/>
......I can use this. <br/>
 <br/>
"If Firo agrees to it she can take her Philo Rial form and you two can go out and play together." <br/>
"Really!?" <br/>
"Yeah, go play until you're finished and then return." <br/>
"Yay~!" <br/>
 <br/>
The goddamn kid pats Firo with a smile. <br/>
 <br/>
"Master. What about Firo?" <br/>
"Play with the child. I order you not to injure her." <br/>
"Yay~!" <br/>
 <br/>
Firo saddles the little shit on her back. <br/>
Her expression instantly brightens. <br/>
 <br/>
"Yaay! We're so high!" <br/>
"Let's go play!" <br/>
"Ok!" <br/>
 <br/>
They happily run off together. <br/>
The knights chase after them with a perplexed expression. <br/>
 <br/>
"It's finally quite again." <br/>
"Naofumi-sama, your expression right now is very evil." <br/>
"There's no problems. That goddamn brat is probably going to forget any grudges she has after this." <br/>
"Goddamn brat...... Naofumi-sama do you dislike kids?" <br/>
"Not particularly. If I disliked them I would have abandoned you and Firo a long time ago. <br/>
"Well, that's true." <br/>
 <br/>
I hate her because she is accusing me. <br/>
I'd like to avoid any falling sparks if possible. <br/>
 <br/>
"When we enter the neighbouring country they should stop." <br/>
 <br/>
If she's an animal enthusiast and will just play with Firo it'll be fine. <br/>
 <br/>
"......I guess." <br/>
 <br/>
That day, Firo did not come back until very late. <br/>
It seems they were very  exited about having new friends and played a lot, well it's good that they are happy about it. <br/>
By the way the name of that goddamn kid is Mel-chan. <br/>
 <br/>
 <br/>
Next morning. <br/>
After eating a light breakfast we leave the inn quickly. On the Road. <br/>
 <br/>
"Waaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaait!" <br/>
 <br/>
I crease my brows and face palm. <br/>
I knew this was going to happen, but to think she would be this quick. <br/>
I already forgot about the fellow when we departed this morning. <br/>
 <br/>
"Ah, it's Mel-Chan" <br/>
 <br/>
Since Firo stopped I got off the carriage to welcome the goddamn kid. <br/>
 <br/>
"You should be glad Firo-chan I won't have the Hero of the Shield apologize if we can play!" <br/>
"I'm sorry. Are we done?" <br/>
"Don't apologize to me, do it to father!" <br/>
 <br/>
So annoying. <br/>
I can't deal with her. <br/>
 <br/>
"If you don't apologize everyone won't be forgiven." <br/>
 <br/>
So she says, as the knight behind her pulls out a sword. <br/>
You want to fight? <br/>
Against a Hero? <br/>
Huh? The guy behind the goddamn brat is pointing a crystal ball at me. <br/>
What's that? <br/>
Suddenly I notice. <br/>
 <br/>
This guy......He's not looking at me. <br/>
 <br/>
I feel a chill run up my spine. <br/>
This foreboding feeling ,and atmosphere reminds me of when I was deceived by that bitch. <br/>
This atmosphere that I encountered the past few months of trying to plunge another into despair. <br/>
 <br/>
I charge the Knight at once. <br/>
And my premonition becomes reality. <br/>
The knight aims his sword at the goddamn kid. <br/>
 <br/>
"Kyaaaaaaaaaaaa!?" <br/>
"Air Strike Shield!" <br/>
 <br/>
The goddamn brats starts to scream. I immediately cast Air Strike Shield to intercept. <br/>
 <br/>
"......What the hell are you doing!" <br/>
 <br/>
I stand in front of the goddamn kid and glare at the enemy. <br/>
 <br/>
"You Shield! how dare you hold a princess hostage!" <br/>
"Huh?" <br/>
 <br/>
Princess? <br/>
Regardless of who you are looking after, isn't it weird to call them princess? <br/>
The goddamn kid seems to know what's going on and her face turns blue. <br/>
 <br/>
"The shield is evil! I've known since the beginning." <br/>
 <br/>
The enemies are attacking us while saying so. <br/>
I protect the goddamn kid by pulling her close. <br/>
Gakin, the clashing of metal resounds in the area. <br/>
 <br/>
"Damn......" <br/>
 <br/>
The enemy starts to cast magic that rains fire. <br/>
Can't be helped. I'll cover the goddamn kid with my mantle to protect her from magic. <br/>
 <br/>
"You......Demon of the Shield!" <br/>
"Firo, Raphtalia!" <br/>
"Okay!" <br/>
"Okay~!" <br/>
 <br/>
As per my instructions. Raphtalia and Firo charges the enemy. <br/>
Just as we counter attack the enemy retreats on horseback. <br/>
 <br/>
"Fools." <br/>
 <br/>
Firo's leg power overwhelms horses. One of them is instanly blown off. <br/>
 <br/>
"Guaaaaaaaaaaa!" <br/>
"Ah, it's the devil!" <br/>
 <br/>
Additionally, we pursue the enemy and continue attacking, one , two, some were captured but a few of them managed to get away. <br/>
 <br/>
"what the hell is wrong with these guys." <br/>
 <br/>
Were they not the goddamn brat's guards? <br/>
A princess huh. <br/>
I have no choice but to perform a few interrogations here. <br/>
I ask the enemies who are bound by rope. <br/>
 <br/>
"Now then, you bastards, tell me you are trying to kill a child. Only the reason." <br/>
"As If I have anything to say to a devil" <br/>
"Hooh......" <br/>
 <br/>
Devil, huh. It's been a while since I've been straight up called that. <br/>
Regardless of who it's always Hero of the Shield. <br/>
 <br/>
"You. Do you understand what's happening to you?" <br/>
 <br/>
I give instructions to Firo. <br/>
 <br/>
"Food?" <br/>
 <br/>
The enemy's face turns blue. <br/>
 <br/>
"I will sacrifice myself for god...... God will lead me to heaven." <br/>
 <br/>
......Religion. <br/>
Against these kinds of fanatics threats will not work. <br/>
 <br/>
"Hey brat, you have any ideas?" <br/>
 <br/>
The goddamn brat shakes her head in fear. <br/>
 <br/>
"Say, what religion do you believe in? It'll probably be to some stupid god anyway." <br/>
"The three Heroes Church! You damn Devil! You dare mock God?" <br/>
 <br/>
As I thought. These fools can't stand it when their religion is mocked. <br/>
Now, if I can skilfully manipulate him with insults I may be able to get some information. <br/>
 <br/>
"The religion of this country." <br/>
 <br/>
Raphtalia mutters alone. <br/>
 <br/>
"Do you know about it?" <br/>
"This country mostly believes in the teachings of the Three Heroes. I did not believe since my parents were from a different religion." <br/>
"......Then this guy is just using religion as a tool for personal gains." <br/>
"Ah, Yeah" <br/>
 <br/>
I find a Rosary-like Accessory on the people who Raphtalia tied up. <br/>
 <br/>
"I'm going to place this on the ground." <br/>
"Hah......" <br/>
 <br/>
What a strange symbol. Three weapons pile on top of each other. <br/>
Sword, Spear, and Bow? <br/>
Quite an unpleasant line up of weapons. <br/>
 <br/>
"Now, I will step on this tool if you guys don't speak obediently." <br/>
"St-Stooooooop!" <br/>
 <br/>
The enemy's cry stops me. <br/>
That was quite early...... <br/>
Is this lump of metal so important? <br/>
Rather than anything special, it just reminds me of a fashion accessory, it doesn't even have any special effects. <br/>
Though it might just be the case for me since people in my world start wars for religion. <br/>
 <br/>
"Look at this." <br/>
 <br/>
I repeatedly stomp on the strange symbol with my foot. <br/>
 <br/>
"You devil of the shield! God will never forgive such acts!" <br/>
"I know, now tell me quickly why you're trying to kill her. Or is this the degree of your faith? Huh?" <br/>
"Damn......" <br/>
"To think there would be a devil stepping on god's symbol right in front of you. Shouldn't god be on your side?" <br/>
 <br/>
It's the opposite of the loyalty test. <br/>
Since this guy recognizes me as the devil, he will not stand by as I perform barbaric acts. <br/>
 <br/>
"If you spit it out I'll stop." <br/>
"I'm not going to listen to anything a d-devil has to say." <br/>
"ah I see." <br/>
 <br/>
I stomp on the symbol hard enough that it sinks into the ground. <br/>
 <br/>
"You bastaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaard!" <br/>
 <br/>
Hmm...... I wonder what happened. <br/>
Did he finally realise his position? <br/>
 <br/>
"Hey brat, who is this guy anyway?" <br/>
"Aau......" <br/>
 <br/>
The goddamn brat still seems to be recovering from the fear of almost being killed.  <br/>
 <br/>
"Mel-chan. Master and Firo is here so you'll be alright." <br/>
"......Firo-chan" <br/>
 <br/>
The goddamn kid collects herself, gives me a look and mutters. <br/>
 <br/>
"Uhm. These people are my father's knights." <br/>
"That reminds me, who is your father?" <br/>
"Father?" <br/>
"Yeah, which noble family are you from?" <br/>
"Uhm" <br/>
 <br/>
Not nobility? Then what is it? <br/>
She looks considerably well-bred, is she the daughter of a famous merchant? <br/>
Daughter of the accessory merchant? Though there should be no reason for malice if that's the case. <br/>
......From this guy's speech and behaviour her dad should be quite powerful and respected. <br/>
I still think she's some noble's daughter. <br/>
 <br/>
"Father is the king of this country." <br/>
"......What?" <br/>
"Holt Clay = Merlot Mark the 32nd. I am Melty = Merlot Mark......This country's princess." <br/>
(Tl note: Holt Clay...... as expected of the trash. If anyone has a better name let me know.オルトクレイ＝メルロマルク３２世。私はメルティ＝メルロマルク……この国の第二王女) <br/>
 <br/>
Thus, I somehow became embroiled in a ridiculous conspiracy.
