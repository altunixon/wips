Chapter 270: The Pig King<br/>
The next day.<br/>
Witch was successfully transported, and Motoyasu returns by portal. I’m made to watch the Guro movie of Witch being violated by Faubley’s Pig King.<br/>
Some of the king’s soldiers are here as well.<br/>
Apparently, they’re here to confirm that I watched the video.<br/>
Even I don’t want to watch it alone. I bring Ren, Motoyasu, and Itsuki along to do a private screening of it.<br/>
The soldiers caution me that it isn’t a pretty recording.<br/>
Well, Raphtalia and Rishia are watching as well.<br/>
Female Knight… would be dangerous to show it to, so I drove her away.<br/>
"Hero of the Shield-san, are you watching~?"<br/>
Uwah… It’s a fat, wrinkly, pig-like fatty.<br/>
I think he resembles something.<br/>
Ah, he looks like that monster that appeared in that famous movie about wars in space. (ED: Jabba the Hutt from Star Wars XD)<br/>
How old is he? He’s definitely older than Trash, but his terrible looks take away any age-distinguishing features.<br/>
It’s like he’s an ageless demon.<br/>
"Noooooooo!" (Witch)<br/>
Witch screams out.<br/>
"You’re being loud. Like this, I can’t send a message to Hero of the Shield-san."<br/>
He violently grabs her by the hair and swings the naked Witch around.<br/>
"Ugu… Noooooo!" (Witch)<br/>
It seems that at this point, Witch can do nothing but scream.<br/>
For some reason, it puts my heart at ease.<br/>
"I told you to shut up."<br/>
With his chubby hands, he grabs Witch’s neck. His motions seem highly practiced.<br/>
Oy, that’s the movement used to break a chicken’s neck.<br/>
"Ah… ku…"<br/>
Witch resists with her life on the line, but to no avail. Eventually, bubbles start coming out of her mouth, and she faints.<br/>
After that, the Pig King enthusiastically introduces himself, and wakes Witch with slaps to the face. The Guro scenes follow.<br/>
It’s a mix between a health video featuring the copulation of pigs, and an overly sadistic snuff film.<br/>
If you made something like this in my old world, it would be a matter left to the police.<br/>
I was right to bar the others from viewing it.<br/>
Melty may have been fine, but Kiel and Taniko would be shaking in their boots.<br/>
Regardless, this would cause quite a few traumas, so I probably won’t watch if he sends another.<br/>
"Uu…" (Ren)<br/>
Within three minutes, Ren is covering his mouth and breathing deeply.<br/>
He and Raphtalia leave the room together.<br/>
Though I feel it’s revolting as well.<br/>
How about Motoyasu, Itsuki, and Rishia?<br/>
"Fu-fufufun" (Motoyasu) (TL: Humming SFX)<br/>
Motoyasu is… spreading out a sheet of paper and sketching.<br/>
When I peek over to see what he’s drawing, I’m not surprised to find that it is Firo.<br/>
To be able to draw while witnessing this footage, I’m amazed. I honestly want to admire him.<br/>
No wait, he’s not even watching.<br/>
When I’m feeling this unpleasant, he’s humming and singing…<br/>
"Don’t get distracted. Just watch." (Naofumi)<br/>
"What’s so fun about watching pigs mate? And I’ve already seen the scene happen, Father-in-Law." (Motoyasu)<br/>
"So you can remain cool while watching this?" (Naofumi)<br/>
"It’s not really different from watching monsters get killed. Hahaha." (Motoyasu)<br/>
Yes. I feel madness from Motoyasu.<br/>
His three followers are watching the film while drooling.<br/>
"That pig. It has a lot of fat on it. Doesn’t it look tasty?" (Kuu)<br/>
"But doesn’t it look a little tough?" (Marin)<br/>
"If you let it rot for a while, it’ll become softer and tastier. Leave the preparations to me." (Midori)<br/>
They truly are beasts.<br/>
But I guess this is how Filo Rials are.<br/>
Ah, I found this out later, but Midori is of a subspecies that could control poison and decay.<br/>
But for them to watch this footage and stay calm, they really are monsters.<br/>
By the way, when I showed it to Firo the next day, she became sick.<br/>
Does it have to do with individual personality?<br/>
Ah, but at the start, she did say, ‘That pig looks tasty.’<br/>
The Pig King can’t even be classified as human at this point in time.<br/>
Now Itsuki and Rishia are…<br/>
Rishia’s already fainted.<br/>
Itsuki has a calm expression… No, he has no expression as he silently watches it.<br/>
"Itsuki, what do you think?" (Naofumi)<br/>
"I don’t understand what’s fun about it." (Itsuki)<br/>
"What a coincidence. I’m of the same opinion." (Naofumi)<br/>
I’m already regretting ordering this video to be taken.<br/>
No, I wanted it as evidence, but I never thought I would have to watch it to the end.<br/>
Can I not fast forward?<br/>
"To make sure you’re actually watching, we’ll be taking a video." (Soldier)<br/>
The soldier holds up a crystal in my direction.<br/>
"I’ll at least pretend to watch it." (Naofumi)<br/>
"Yes… Um… I’m truly sorry for the trouble, Hero-sama." (Soldier)<br/>
This soldier’s perceptiveness is a life saver.<br/>
To avoid any complaints, I have to continue watching the video to the end.<br/>
I absentmindedly stare at the screen while I use status magic to check my slaves’ statuses, waiting for the end.<br/>
"Then, I’ll be coming to deliver another one in the near future. The King was exceedingly happy to hear that the Hero of the Shield requested such a video, so he will continue sending them." (Soldier)<br/>
"… Could you reproduce and edit the footage you took right now to make it seem like I watched them? If need be, I can do some acting to increase the variety of reaction footage." (Naofumi)<br/>
"Yes, of course we can do that." (Soldier)<br/>
The soldier said as such, and when he brought the next video, we opted not to watch it.<br/>
Our hearts are as one.<br/>
If I had to see these videos again and again, I would go crazy.<br/>
At the end of the video, Witch was all beaten up, and she was put to sleep by strangling again. But only after she had lost an arm.<br/>
Her facial expression must have been appealing, because the Pig King gave a face of ecstasy.<br/>
I’ve played Guro Galge and Rape Galge before, but this is too much.<br/>
With something like this, if you simply owned it, you would be liable for arrest.<br/>
And in the end, Witch was easily killed off. But as the Pig King was under the impression that I was still deriving enjoyment from his videos, he thought that I would like to see a large variety of woman being violated.<br/>
Instead of playing with his favorite toys for long periods of time, he seemed to have found something else to take delight in.<br/>
Go to hell. Why do I have to watch these guro videos of other women being violated?<br/>
The end result, is that a large amount of useless video crystals ended up piling up in the village store house.<br/>
I really don’t want to meet that pig.<br/>
I once again pledge that in my heart.<br/>
"Ah… I feel sick." (Naofumi)<br/>
A few days later, in the evening.<br/>
I mutter those words as I entered the onsen at Cal Mira.<br/>
I assigned everyone their jobs, and when evening came, I took Itsuki and Rishia here by Portal.<br/>
Itsuki doesn’t recover Mana or SP, so he can’t use portal.<br/>
That’s why I have to bring them.<br/>
I got permission for Rishia to bathe in the men’s side.<br/>
She was worried that if I was the only one there, Itsuki would die from drowning.<br/>
Wearing a white robe, Rishia helps Itsuki submerge himself in the water.<br/>
Wouldn’t a swimsuit be fine here?<br/>
Ah, Raphtalia, Firo, and Melty are also here, albeit on the women’s side.<br/>
Atlas was going to come as well, but Fohl stopped her.<br/>
An onsen is perfect if you want to rest your body and mind.<br/>
I had just washed my body and was about to step in, when Firo jumps over the hedge separating the two baths with Melty on her back.<br/>
"Master~ Let’s bathe together again~" (Firo)<br/>
"Firo-chan! This is the men’s bath! Naofumi is here, isn’t he!?" (Melty)<br/>
Melty frantically covers her important places with a towel as she embarrassingly complains to Firo.<br/>
Firo. You sure brought a troublesome person to a troublesome place.<br/>
"Don’t worry, Melty-chan. Right now, only Master, the bow person, and Rishia-oneechan are here." (Firo)<br/>
"Isn’t the fact that Naofumi and the Hero of the Bow are here the problem!?" (Melty)<br/>
"Eh?" (Firo)<br/>
It may sound strange, Firo, but Melty’s reaction is the correct one.<br/>
I should leave disciplining her to Raphtalia and Melty.<br/>
It would be strange for me to be telling her that.<br/>
"But bathing with master is fun, so Melty-chan should have fun too." (Firo)<br/>
"No! I’ll get dirty!" (Melty)<br/>
"Hey." (Naofumi)<br/>
I submerge myself in the bathwater as I speak.<br/>
Seeing her love of cleanliness and her innocence, I’m beginning to doubt whether or not she’s truly the sister of that Witch.<br/>
But I guess it’s fine.<br/>
Firo ignores her, changes into human form, and sits beside me.<br/>
"Pii!"<br/>
From the towel wrapped around my waist, one of the Filo Rial familiars appears.<br/>
"Where did you come out of!?" (Naofumi)<br/>
"N-Naofumi gave birth to a Filo Rial!" (Melty)<br/>
Melty shouts out, but from her towel, a chick emerges as well.<br/>
I heard about it, but I guess they’re parasitizing off Melty as well.<br/>
"Look who’s talking!" (Naofumi)<br/>
"S-shut up!" (Melty)<br/>
"Ahaha~ Master and Melty are having fun." (Firo)<br/>
"We’re not!" (Naofumi & Melty)<br/>
Dammit, these birds can’t read the mood.<br/>
"Master, can you wash Firo’s back?" (Firo)<br/>
"Ah, yes, yes." (Naofumi)<br/>
If I don’t do it, she’ll complain.<br/>
It’s been a few days since I started coming here to alleviate my curse.<br/>
Firo coming to the men’s bath has become a daily occurrence.<br/>
Though, this is the first time she’s brought Melty along.<br/>
I use some soap and begin rubbing Firo’s back. Because she has wings, quite a few bubbles form.<br/>
"Hey, Melty-chan should get her back washed too~" (Firo)<br/>
"Don’t! Want! To!" (Melty)<br/>
Melty sure is stubborn.<br/>
Though, I think I’m an expert in that field as well.<br/>
But Firo sure likes taking people over to the men’s side.<br/>
Ah, the first person she brought over was Kiel.<br/>
Apparently, for the male-hearted Kiel, the women’s bath was uncomfortable, so she got Firo to bring her over.<br/>
After that, it became natural to scold Firo and Kiel, who swam around the male bath as if it were natural.<br/>
Why do I have to act like a parent and scold these kids when I’m supposed to be relaxing in the onsen?<br/>
Raphtalia always lectures them not to come over, but they don’t listen.<br/>
"Look, you’re all clean now." (Naofumi)<br/>
"Ya~y."(Firo)<br/>
I pour a bucket of hot water on her to wash away the bubbles, and Firo shakes her entire body like a dog to dry herself. Water droplets fly everywhere.<br/>
"Master, thank you~. Is Firo clean?" (Firo)<br/>
"If you doubt it, then wash yourself." (Naofumi)<br/>
"Bu-" (Firo)<br/>
Firo pouts, and Melty refuses to take her body out of the water.<br/>
The bath is as lively as ever.<br/>
"Then I’m going to be soaking for a while, so you guys better return to the women’s bath." (Naofumi)<br/>
"Got~ it." (Firo)<br/>
I get in the water again to cure my curse, when Firo changes to Filo Rial form and sits next to me.<br/>
She’s floating. (ED: LOL)<br/>
Is she some sort of water bird? Though, Firo can swim.<br/>
"Ah!?" (Firo)<br/>
Firo seems to have figured something out as she lets out a noise. She puts Melty on her back.<br/>
"Firo-chan, what are you…" (Melty)<br/>
Before Melty can finish speaking, Firo jumps over the hedge and returns to the women’s side.<br/>
"W-what was that about?" (Rishia)<br/>
Rishia inquires.<br/>
"Who knows?" (Naofumi)<br/>
"Will Rishia-san not go to the women’s bath as well?" (Itsuki)<br/>
Itsuki tilts his head as he asks.<br/>
It seems that a little bit of common sense still lingers in his head.<br/>
Though, I have no idea how much we should trust Itsuki’s common sense.<br/>
"I’m alright, Itsuki-sama." (Rishia)<br/>
These two are acting like an idiot couple.<br/>
Now that I think about it, since we started using this bath, Itsuki’s condition has gradually been changing.<br/>
He’s still expressionless, but his indecisiveness is beginning to heal.<br/>
The fact that he can ask things like this is proof.<br/>
"Oh my! If it isn’t Father-in-Law!?" (Motoyasu)<br/>
Aa, so this is the reason Firo quickly retreated.<br/>
