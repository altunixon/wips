<br/>
"Takki-dono!" <br/>
*Don!* An empty mug hits the table.<br/>
O-Ooh…<br/>
That gentle Fuji-yan is mad.<br/>
Haven’t seen this since the time I accidentally erased his game data a long time ago.<br/>
How nostalgic—wait, this is not the time for that.<br/>
How did it end up like this?<br/>
◇◇<br/>
 "Takatsuki Makoto-sama, are you there?" <br/>
One day around noon.<br/>
In the dining area of the Adventurer Guild, the one who came while I was having lunch with Lucy was the clerk that works at the store of Fuji-yan.<br/>
The rabbit ear girl.<br/>
"Makoto-kun is here." (Mary)<br/>
Mary-san leads her to me.<br/>
"So Makoto-kun even knows a cute rabbitkin girl like this, huh…" (Mary)<br/>
For some reason, Mary-san sat on the table as well.<br/>
Is it okay to not work?<br/>
"Good afternoon, it has been a while." (Makoto) <br/>
I greet the rabbit girl.<br/>
"Good afternoon, friend of master. My name’s Nina, from the Fujiwara Store." (Nina)<br/>
She lightly bows.<br/>
"Have some business with Makoto?" (Lucy)<br/>
Be a bit more friendly, okay?<br/>
But Nina-san didn’t break her smile.<br/>
"Oh! You must be the comrade of Takatsuki-sama, Lucy-sama, right?! I heard that you are an incredible fire magic user." (Nina)<br/>
"Eh? T-That’s right. I am surprised you know." (Lucy)<br/>
Lucy was flustered at being suddenly praised.<br/>
How easy.<br/>
"To mark this moment that I met a future great mage-sama, here." (Nina)<br/>
She gives us something.<br/>
It seems like there’s one for Mary-san too.<br/>
"Wa! This is really delicious." (Lucy)<br/>
"Yum! This is the first time I have eaten this. It is delicious!" (Mary)<br/>
Lucy and Mary-san were overjoyed.<br/>
That’s probably chocolate. <br/>
As expected of Fuji-yan, he even has that in stock?<br/>
"So, what business do you have?", I ask Nina-san.<br/>
"Right! I have a message from Goshujin-sama. ‘At 18 o’clock today, let’s have dinner at Cat Ear Garden’." (Nina)<br/>
"The usual establishment." (Makoto)<br/>
A restaurant that Fuji-yan frequents where all their employees have cat ears.<br/>
"Are you available?" (Nina)<br/>
"Now that I think about it, I haven’t met him for 1 month. I want to meet him too. It is okay." (Makoto)<br/>
"That’s a relief. Goshujin-sama will be happy." (Nina)<br/>
"Eh? What should I do today?" (Lucy)<br/>
Lucy turns my way as if sulking.<br/>
I just thought it would be fine to act separately every now and then, you know. Don’t look at me with those eyes.<br/>
"If it is okay, you can bring your comrade, Lucy-san, with you." (Nina)<br/>
Nina-san invites her.<br/>
"I want to go too~." (Mary)<br/>
Even Mary-san pokes her head in.<br/>
"Mary-san, you okay with work?" (Makoto)<br/>
"Today it is until night…" (Mary)<br/>
"Then you can’t." (Makoto)<br/>
"Makoto-kun, so cold!" (Mary)<br/>
Mary-san goes ‘so cruel~’ as she returns to the reception.<br/>
"Well then, we will be waiting there." (Nina)<br/>
Nina-san also left.<br/>
"Hey hey", Lucy pulls my sleeve.<br/>
"What?" (Makoto)<br/>
"The owner of the Fujiwara Store is a shrewd merchant that came from a parallel world, right? So he was your friend!" (Lucy)<br/>
"Yeah. You know him, Lucy?" (Makoto)<br/>
"What are you saying?! When talking about the Fujiwara Store’s owner, you talk about the many trades he has succeeded in 1 year, and there’s rumors about him having connections with the feudal lord of Makkaren. He grasps the weaknesses of his opposing merchants one after the other, and shuts them up, and it is said that he knows everything about the underground world of this city. He is a big hit that’s at the top ranking of the people you shouldn’t go against in this city!" (Lucy)<br/>
"Is that so…" (Makoto)<br/>
I didn’t know.<br/>
Even when I ask Fuji-yan about this city, he only goes ‘no, it is nothing big-desu zo’.<br/>
It sounds like he has been using his cheat skill and climbing well.<br/>
"Then, let’s train till evening." (Makoto)<br/>
"Eeh? Isn’t it okay not to for today?" (Lucy)<br/>
"I will train alone then." (Makoto)<br/>
"I was joking! I will work hard too!" (Lucy)<br/>
We trained real hard till evening.<br/>
◇◇<br/>
 """"Cheers!""""<br/>
At night, in the Cat Ears Garden.<br/>
Today we have Fuji-yan, Lucy, Nina-san, and me. <br/>
Maybe he showed consideration by not letting Lucy be the only girl?<br/>
The food here is delicious and the variety of drinks is numerous. <br/>
Also, the employees are all cat eared (beastkin).<br/>
I don’t see the appeal of it, but regardless of cat ears, I think the employees are cute.<br/>
We were guided to a table in the deep areas in this restaurant that’s always packed.<br/>
Fuji-yan is a frequent VIP.<br/>
"N-Nice to meet you, I am the mage, Lucy." (Lucy)<br/>
It is rare to see Lucy be this nervous.<br/>
"Nice to meet you. My name is Fujiwara. Please call me Fuji-yan like Takki-dono does." (Fujiwara)<br/>
"I am Nina. I work in the Fujiwara Store, and am also working as an adventurer. I am Silver Rank." (Nina)<br/>
Saying this, she shows us her silver badge.<br/>
"That’s impressive." (Makoto)<br/>
"No no, not really." (Nina)<br/>
It is said that one of the walls of adventurer ranks is Silver.<br/>
Apparently a decently good adventurer can reach around Iron Rank if they work hard. <br/>
Silver Ranks up are called when there’s an emergency quest where strong monsters appear, and they are trusted by the guild.<br/>
She is being humble, but Nina should be pretty strong.<br/>
"We are bronze rank. We have to work hard, Lucy." (Makoto)<br/>
"I-I have a Monarch Grade Skill after all!" (Lucy)<br/>
Oi oi, don’t try taking the high ground here.<br/>
Fuji-yan who is an information network probably already knows that you can’t use it properly at all, you know?<br/>
"Weell, Takki-dono, you are good. To be able to get a beautiful elf mage like this as your party member." (Fujiwara)<br/>
"Now now, go ahead, Lucy-sama." (Nina)<br/>
"Eh? T-Thank you." (Lucy)<br/>
Fuji-yan stretches, and Nina-san pours wine for Lucy.<br/>
Lucy was just drinking whatever they poured in.<br/>
Aah, she is gonna collapse real quick at this rate.<br/>
I was eating bone meat, pasta with a whole lot of tomato sauce on, and garlic toast.<br/>
The food here really is good. <br/>
◇◇<br/>
"Makoto, you are way too zealous!" (Lucy)<br/>
Lucy is drunk.<br/>
When Lucy gets drunk, she either falls asleep, or gets stormy; today it is the latter, huh.<br/>
How troublesome.<br/>
"He is training everyday, every single day, without getting bored of it. And on top of that, Mary-san is wooing him." (Lucy)<br/>
"That last part has no relevance with me being zealous though." (Makoto)<br/>
She is just being kind with me.<br/>
"But I have heard talk about you two. Being able to defeat a Griffon even though you guys are bronze rank is impressive. Even I wouldn’t be able to defeat one alone." (Nina)<br/>
"We were just lucky. I ended up burning myself." (Makoto)<br/>
"Burned?! The Griffons of this world can spit fire?" (Fujiwara)<br/>
"That’s right. It is scary, ya know?" (Makoto)<br/>
"Makoto~, don’t lie." (Lucy)<br/>
I was bullshitting there and Lucy retorted. <br/>
But telling him that I was burned from the magic of a party member doesn’t sound cool.<br/>
We were having a fun talk there for a while, but when the conversation moved to Jean and Emily, who we were getting along with lately, the expression of Fuji-yan got sterner. <br/>
Eh? Did I say something weird?<br/>
Fuji-yan gulps down his ale till it is empty.<br/>
"…"<br/>
He goes silent.<br/>
"Goshujin-sama?" (Nina)<br/>
Nina-san makes a troubled expression.<br/>
"Fuji-yan?" (Makoto)<br/>
I called my friend who was now few in words.<br/>
Lucy is sleeping.<br/>
She is down.<br/>
"Takki-dono!" (Fujiwara)<br/>
*Don!*, he hits the empty mug onto the table.<br/>
"Y-Yes?" (Makoto)<br/>
"Why are you not inviting me to your party?!" (Fujiwara)<br/>
"Huh?" (Makoto)<br/>
That’s what he is angry about?<br/>
"I was waiting this whole time, you know?! Didn’t you say you would form a party with me when you got stronger!" (Fujiwara)<br/>
"D-Did I…?" (Makoto)<br/>
"Goshujin-sama was always fidgety waiting, thinking that Takki-dono will soon be coming." (Nina)<br/>
Achaa.<br/>
I did something bad there then.<br/>
"I felt abandoned there, you know. Even though I was the first one to invite you in this city." (Fujiwara)<br/>
"Sorry, Fuji-yan. I was thinking about doing that once I raised my level a bit more." (Makoto)<br/>
"If it is Takatsuki-sama’s level, you should have no problems with an easy dungeon." (Nina)<br/>
I see, you are right.<br/>
I have been getting experience points one way or another.<br/>
"Fuji-yan, I look forward to working with you. Let’s form a party as the former A class duo." (Makoto)<br/>
"Yeah! I have been waiting for those words!" (Fujiwara)<br/>
He shakes my hand.<br/>
Ah, I decided without consulting with Lucy. Is that okay?<br/>
Oh well, it should be fine.<br/>
