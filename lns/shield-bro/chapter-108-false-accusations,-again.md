<br/>
Not as rage inducing as I expected, the voodoo doll I prepared went unused. Still, quite angry though.<br/>
False Accusations, Again<br/>
The other heroes seem to have all boarded the ship. I was informed by Shadow as the ship departed.<br/>
I am thinking about the future while watching the sun set over the sea.<br/>
First of all, what are all the things that I need to ask the queen when we get back to the castle town?<br/>
Next, I need to go to the old man’s place to prepare for the next wave. On that topic, should I ask the queen for materials?<br/>
If there is time, it wouldn’t be bad to go demon hunting ourselves for the materials.<br/>
Afterwards, there is also that thing about completely tempering my shield. There is a limit to how many reinforcement materials I can get on the island.<br/>
At night, I headed up to the deck after finishing dinner .<br/>
I watch the sea and feel the evening wind.<br/>
……I found Firo exercising by swimming after her meal.<br/>
Just how obsessed are you with swimming right now.<br/>
(TLnote: マイブーム MaiBumu…… Apparently it means:" Something that a person is currently obsessed with."<br/>
I’ll pretend I didn’t see anything.<br/>
Naofumi:"Hm?"<br/>
I see Motoyasu at the corner of the deck…… And I also discover Rishia there.<br/>
Flirting again? That reminds me, Rishia was also included in Motoyasu’s beautiful girl ranking.<br/>
Just how much do you want to make a harem.<br/>
Do you even know what Itsuki would say?<br/>
For the time being, I’ll warn him a bit.<br/>
Naofumi:" Hey. Motoyasu, why don’t you stop flirting here–"<br/>
Motoyasu:"Ah! If it isn’t Naofumi! I beg you!"<br/>
Motoyasu seems to have a pale complexion and pushes Rishia to me by her shoulders.<br/>
Naofumi:"What’s up with you?"<br/>
Motoyasu:"It’s fine! I’ll leave it to you!"<br/>
What’s the matter? To think that womanizer would entrust me with something…… When I look at Rishia, she seems surprised.<br/>
For some reason……Her eyes are swollen up and bloodshot.<br/>
Rishia was probably sitting down in that corner crying over and over.<br/>
Naofumi:"Wh-What’s wrong!?"<br/>
Motoyasu:"Th-Then with this I’m done!"<br/>
Naofumi:"Wait! Surely you didn’t……Not on a ship……"<br/>
Did you fall so low as to commit a crime?<br/>
Since she didn’t obey did you say: "It’s alright, it’ll only hurt in the beginning……" and rape Rishia?<br/>
It does seem like a Motoyasu’s modus operandi.That guy seems like he could nonchalantly steal someone else’s lover.<br/>
And so, it leads to her being so upset and crying.<br/>
What a terrible sleazebag. I’ll never let you escape.<br/>
Motoyasu:"Th-That’s not it!"<br/>
Naofumi:"Then prove it."<br/>
Rishia:"Mo-Motoyasu-sama isn’t responsible……"<br/>
Rishia muttered in a hoarse voice.<br/>
Damn, was I just over thinking?<br/>
As expected even Motoyasu isn’t rotten to this degree.<br/>
Naofumi:"Then what happened?"<br/>
Motoyasu:"There are certain circumstances. But I’m no good at dealing with it. Therefore I’ll entrust it to you!"<br/>
After saying that while laughing, Motoyasu escaped back to his cabin while trembling after a large sigh.<br/>
That’s the first time I’ve seen such an expression on Motoyasu.<br/>
Or perhaps, Is that guy the type that is not good at dealing with women?<br/>
Was it because of what type Rishia is? That guy’s good luck looks a little weak.<br/>
Firo:"What happened~?"<br/>
Firo noticed the situation and asked after returning to the deck.<br/>
Rishia:"Please don’t worry about it."<br/>
Naofumi:" I’m afraid I can’t do that, I feel uneasy thinking you might have been raped by Motoyasu."<br/>
Rishia:"No……I just couldn’t put up with it any more."<br/>
Naofumi:"You couldn’t put up with Motoyasu:"<br/>
Rishia:"Th-That’s not it!"<br/>
Though still tearful, for a moment she looked slightly angry. Did she get a little vigor back?<br/>
Rishia:"Motoyasu-sama tried to cheer me up at first too……As I though, I don’t think I should talk about it."<br/>
Naofumi:"Don’t say something like that……You help me once before, I am grateful."<br/>
It was Rishia that taught me about the ore that Itsuki uses.<br/>
If Rishia is troubled, I want to co-operate as much as possible.<br/>
Rishia:"No……Really, please don’t worry."<br/>
After saying that, Rishia escaped by departing.<br/>
Naofumi:"……What was that about?"<br/>
In the end, only unpleasant examples of what might have happened remains.<br/>
Next morning.<br/>
I was reading a book in the cabin while questioning Rishia’s attitude last night.<br/>
Naofumi:"I’m worried after all."<br/>
For some reason……This is something that by all rights I could ignore, but my heart is noisy.<br/>
This feeling resembles the time when Melty was attacked by the guard and when I was falsely accused by Bitch.<br/>
I have a very bad feeling about this.<br/>
Raphtalia:"Is something wrong?"<br/>
Naofumi:"Just a little. I can’t relax so I’ll just go investigate something a little."<br/>
Raphtalia:"I see……"<br/>
I left the room as Raphtalia continued to do push-ups.<br/>
What on earth could have happened? I can’t understand this by myself.<br/>
I feel a little anxiety as I eavesdrop on Ituki’s cabin.<br/>
For some reason, happy voices could be heard.<br/>
Am I over thinking too much?<br/>
Rishia:"Ah……"<br/>
Then I see Rishia, who is for some reason staring enviously at the cabin.<br/>
When she noticed me, she ran away.<br/>
……What is wrong? Really.<br/>
I might be able to discover the circumstances by questioning Motoyasu.<br/>
With that reasoning I knock on the door to Motoyasu’s cabin.<br/>
Woman1:"Yes~"<br/>
Woman 1 Opens the door.<br/>
An amazing smile that I have never seen before was shown to me.<br/>
This girl……She can make such a face?……<br/>
Is this an act to get along with Bitch and Woman2? Frankly, it makes me sick.<br/>
To have the ability to make such a face when she habitually has a deadpan expression.<br/>
Women are scary.<br/>
Woman1:"……Ah, It’s you! If it’s just you, then I can remove the mask!"<br/>
After a few seconds, her facial expression dampened tremendously, vented her anger for acting towards me.<br/>
I absolutely cannot understand why she would be angry.<br/>
Naofumi:"Is Motoyasu here?"<br/>
Bitch:" Is there a reason why I must tell you?"<br/>
Naofumi:"Heey. Motoyasu–"<br/>
Bitch:" Don’t ignore me!"<br/>
Woman2:"Yeah Yeah!"<br/>
Woman 2 is taking advantage of the opportunity. I pretend that Bitch isn’t in my field of view and ignore her.<br/>
I would rather not come here due to the trauma from before.<br/>
This guy doesn’t matter to me.<br/>
Motoyasu:"What’s up with you Naofumi, everyone here seems to hate you."<br/>
Motoyasu talks to me while being sandwiched in a harem-like situation between Bitch and Woman2.<br/>
What an irritating pose.<br/>
It would be impossible to ask about his position without being sarcastic.<br/>
Naofumi:"Such a thing doesn’t matter. I just want to ask about something."<br/>
Motoyasu:"……What is it?"<br/>
Naofumi:"The matter from last night. Something about entrusting me before you left."<br/>
Motoyasu:"……I understand. However, after that I’ll leave everything to you."<br/>
Naofumi:"Leaving it to others……well fine. I’m acting on curiosity. I’ll accept the risk that comes along with it."<br/>
There is an idea forming in my mind, as that guy Motoyasu comes out of the cabin with a pale face while telling his followers to stay.<br/>
When we head up to the deck, he is still looking at me with a pale face.<br/>
Motoyasu:"About Rishia-chan’s situation."<br/>
Naofumi:"Yeah."<br/>
I can’t get the reason why Rishia was crying from questioning her.<br/>
So I’ll ask Motoyasu about the circumstances, since I think he is kind to women.<br/>
Motoyasu:"To tell the truth–"<br/>
The situation was explained from Motoyasu’s point of view……<br/>
After hearing Motoyau’s story, and realising that my intuition was right, there was a lump in my throat as anger surged up.<br/>
Naofumi:"Itsuki——————!"<br/>
I forcefull kick down the door to Itsuki’s room.<br/>
The door opened with a loud bang, and everyone inside stared at me simultaneously.<br/>
Itsuki:"Wh-What is it!?"<br/>
Armour:"Hero of the Shield you bastard!What do you want!"<br/>
Naofumi:"What do I want? Ask yourselves! You trashes!"<br/>
Due to my loud voice, the whole ship felt noisy.<br/>
Itsuki and Armour flinched momentarily due to my oppressive attitude.<br/>
Itsuki was the first to recover and he raises his voice in anger as well.<br/>
Itsuki:"That’s why I asked what the hell happened!"<br/>
Naofumi:"Do you seriously not understand yet!?"<br/>
This is dangerous, if I keep this resentment smouldering in my heart, then the Wrath Shield will appear.<br/>
If Ren comes, it would go on a rampage.<br/>
Armour:"I don’t know what suspicions you have, Hero of the Shield!"<br/>
Armour tried to grab me.<br/>
So I avoided Armour’s arms and applied a joint-locking technique.<br/>
[The rules of a legendary weapon, it is prohibited to have a weapon other than the exclusive weapon]<br/>
(Sfx*)Bashin*Bashin* I received pain through my arm, but I ignore it.<br/>
Am I prohibited from even doing a Joint-lock attack?<br/>
Throwing was okay though, what’s the difference?<br/>
Armour:"Ouch! Owowow!"<br/>
Naofumi:"I came here to talk to Itsuki. Don’t get in my way, you small fry!"<br/>
I thrust away Armour, and glare at Itsuki.<br/>
I haven’t felt this anger in a long time.<br/>
Since I calmed down a lot thanks to Raphtalia.<br/>
I don’t intend to suppress it now.<br/>
Naofumi:"You……For someone who has a habit of claiming justice, you know nothing!"<br/>
Itsuki:"What are you……"<br/>
While angrily looking at Itsuki, I see that Rishia ran towards the commotion and is looking in to the room.<br/>
Itsuki:"Seriously, the reason I think you are so mad, is it that thing?"<br/>
Naofumi:"So you do know."<br/>
Itsuki:"She is the bad one."<br/>
Naofumi:"Don’t joke around!"<br/>
The story that I heard from Motoyasu, it’s—<br/>
The reason that Rishia was grieving that way.<br/>
On the last day of activation, Rishia finished shopping for the day and returned to her companions.<br/>
Itsuki:"Rishia-san. Was it you?"<br/>
Rishia:"Eh? What are you talking about?"<br/>
After Rishia returned, she tilted her neck to Itsuki’s disappointed question.<br/>
Itsuki:"It’s not use to pretend you don’t know. You are the one that broke my accessory."<br/>
After saying so, Itsuki brought out his cherished bracelet that was cruelly broken.<br/>
Rishia:"Eh? I-I have no idea. What is that?"<br/>
Itsuki:"To think you would tell a lie like that……There is evidence."<br/>
After saying so, Itsuki directs his gaze to his other companions.<br/>
Armour:"Yes, we all saw it. Rishia broke the bracelet that Itsuki-sama cherished and hide it."<br/>
No Name:"That’s right."<br/>
No Name2:"I saw it."<br/>
Rishia:"Ehh!? Th-That’s not it! I didn’t do anything……I really didn’t know!"<br/>
Rishia pleaded desperately.<br/>
However, Itsuki doesn’t belive it.<br/>
Itsuki:"So do I not believe in the eye-witness either?……I can’t be helped. I intended to forgive you if you apologized…… Rishia-san, please leave the party starting today."<br/>
Rishia:"N-No way! I really didn’t know anything!"<br/>
At that moment, Rishia saw that Armour was chuckling faintly.<br/>
However, Rishia at that moment was clinging to Itsuki and pleading to not be thrown away.<br/>
Rishia:"I beg you! Please! Let me stay near Itsuki-sama!"<br/>
Itsuki’s eyes swim around and seem to be tormented with a little sense of guilt.<br/>
Armour:"It’s not okay to permit it here, Itsuki-sama!"<br/>
No Name:"There is suspicion that Rishia leaked information to the other Heroes."<br/>
Armour argued with his companion backing him up.<br/>
Itsuki:"It’s regrettable, but…….Farewell."<br/>
Rishia:"Itsuki-sama!? I really really beg you! Please reconsider, I’ll do anything!"<br/>
At Rishia’s tearful begging, Itsuki turned his back and didn’t respond.<br/>
Armour:"How long are you going to provoke Itsuki-sama’s pity! You liar! You don’t have the qualifications to approach Itsuki-sama!"<br/>
Itsuki’s companions forcibly expelled Rishia out.<br/>
After that, even though she wanted to approach even a little……The results were the same.<br/>
This was roughly the contents from Motoyasu’s story on Rishia.<br/>
