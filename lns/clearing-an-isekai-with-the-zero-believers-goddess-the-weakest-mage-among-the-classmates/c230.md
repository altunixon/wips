n<br/>
n“Momo, as an apology for being late to get you, I will avenge you.” (Makoto)n<br/>
nI said to Momo.n<br/>
n“Eh?” (Momo)n<br/>
nShe raised her voice and her cheeks dyed pink.n<br/>
nDid I act a bit too cool there?n<br/>
n“…Did I hear wrong there? I thought I heard the foolish nonsense of livestock.” (Balam)n<br/>
nBalam furrowed his brows in displeasure.n<br/>
nLooks like he can hear me.n<br/>
n“Abel-san, can I leave Momo to you?” (Makoto)n<br/>
nI entrust Momo to Hero Abel.n<br/>
n“Please wait, Makoto-san!” (Abel)n<br/>
n“Makoto-sama!” (Momo)n<br/>
nThe two are still flustered, but I faced the Impenetrable Demon Balam.n<br/>
n“Kill everyone except the Hero.” (Balam)n<br/>
nBalam gave his order bluntly.n<br/>
n“““Yes sir!”””n<br/>
n“““Guooooooooooo!!”””n<br/>
nThe demons and monsters jumped at us at the same time.n<br/>
n“Kuh!” (Abel)n<br/>
n“Hiiih!” (Momo)n<br/>
nHero Abel is protecting Momo who is screaming.n<br/>
nI call to the surroundings.n<br/>
n“XXXXXXXX (Spirit-sans, please do).” (Makoto)n<br/>
n(((((Yes!)))))n<br/>
nI requested to the Water Spirits in Spirit Language.n<br/>
nRight before the swarm of monsters crush us…n<br/>
n“[Ice World].” (Makoto)n<br/>
nThe monsters closeby were frozen.n<br/>
nBut there’s still a lot of enemies.n<br/>
nI could hear Balam going ‘Hooh…’ impressed.n<br/>
n“DIE!!” n<br/>
nA demon holding a pitch black giant scythe jumped at us.n<br/>
n“That’s…?!” (Momo)n<br/>
n“The Vampire Commander!” (Abel)n<br/>
nI heard Momo and Hero Abel.n<br/>
nIs it a famous demon?n<br/>
n“XXXXXXX (Undine, please).” (Makoto)n<br/>
n(Yes, if it is the request of our King.) n<br/>
nIt seems to be a strong enemy, so I ask Undine.n<br/>
n…What’s with the ‘our King’?n<br/>
nI should confirm that later.n<br/>
n“Water Magic: [Frozen Barrier].” (Makoto)n<br/>
nI use the mana of Undine to use Saint Rank Water Magic.n<br/>
n“Guwaaaaaa!” n<br/>
nThe Vampire Commander person was frozen with barrier and all.n<br/>
nIt has been one dimensional for a while now…n<br/>
nWell, that’s fine.n<br/>
nFreezing them is the most efficient method after all.n<br/>
n“Attack them all at once.” (Balam)n<br/>
nBalam ordered to his subordinates with a slightly angered tone.n<br/>
nThe monsters and demons rush at us like a tsunami.n<br/>
nI borrow the mana of the Water Spirits and Undine to fight them back.n<br/>
nThe mana of Spirits is infinite.n<br/>
nBut I lost control in the past and the Great Sage-sama got angry at me though…n<br/>
nIs it thanks to my 999 Water Magic Proficiency?n<br/>
nI can easily use any spell.n<br/>
nI glance at Hero Abel and Momo.n<br/>
nThe two had their mouths wide open.n<br/>
nWhen my eyes met with Momo’s, she said ‘That’s incredible, Makoto-sama!’ with sparkling eyes.n<br/>
nHer looks are that of the Great Sage-sama, so it feels weird…n<br/>
n“You bastard! Where are you looking?!” n<br/>
n“[Ice World].” (Makoto)n<br/>
nAn excited demon jumped at me, so I froze him.n<br/>
nThere’s still a lot of enemies.n<br/>
nLet’s do this without lowering my guard.n<br/>
n◇POV of a certain Demon Lord Confidant◇n<br/>
nI am called the Impenetrable Demon, Balam. I have been serving Bifrons-sama for 500 years.n<br/>
nI have ended uncountable fools who aimed for the Demon Lord-sama.n<br/>
nThis time around it was the execution of the Heroes Setekh captured.n<br/>
nThe stupid gargoyles ended up letting a number of Heroes escape, but one of them brazenly came back.n<br/>
n‘Definitely kill the Light Hero’.n<br/>
nThat’s the order of the Great Demon Lord-sama.n<br/>
nIt has been over 1,000 years since the world has become peaceful for the demons.n<br/>
nIf this so-called Light Hero is a worthy enemy, I would like to cross blades with them.n<br/>
nBut I have no expectations.n<br/>
nOnly few can pose a threat to the Demon Lord-samas.n<br/>
nI haven’t even met a decent fighter in 100 years.n<br/>
nUntil today.n<br/>
nMy subordinates are being frozen one after the other.n<br/>
n“Interesting…” (Balam)n<br/>
nAn opponent with backbone.n<br/>
nPeople who are acting rude right by the vicinity of Bifrons-sama.n<br/>
nHowever, compared to the Lightning Hero who is trembling, he is acting completely composed here.n<br/>
n“I am the Impenetrable Demon Balam! The first confidant of the Demon Lord Bifrons-sama!” (Balam)n<br/>
nI unsheathe the magic sword at my waist.n<br/>
nThis is my first time introducing myself to a human.n<br/>
nThe human mage glanced at me, but didn’t answer.n<br/>
n“Introduce yourself!” (Balam)n<br/>
nI shouted, but there was no response.n<br/>
nI was disappointed.n<br/>
nIn the end, he is just a lowly human.n<br/>
nTo think he can’t even do honorable introductions as warriors.n<br/>
nThen, I will cut you down in one stroke.n<br/>
n“Impenetrable Sword: [Darkness Cut].” (Balam)n<br/>
nA giant dark sword wave was released from my magic sword.n<br/>
n“XXXXXXXX.” n<br/>
nThat mage speaks in unfamiliar words and a giant barrier blocked the sword wave.n<br/>
nIce World, huh.n<br/>
nIt is impressive, but it is not as if he has infinite mana.n<br/>
nWhen you run out of mana, it is your end.n<br/>
nI used my magic sword to continue my attack.n<br/>
nNow, how long will you last?n<br/>
n◇◇n<br/>
n“Impossible, impossible, impossible, impossible, impossible, impossible, impossible, impossible, impossible…” (Balam)n<br/>
nMy slash, stabs, magic; everything was blocked by his magic.n<br/>
nBy the time I noticed, my subordinates had been wiped out.n<br/>
nJust how many spells did he even use?n<br/>
nWhy is his mana not running out?n<br/>
nIt doesn’t make sense.n<br/>
nHe nhasn’t moved one step nfrom his position.n<br/>
nHe continues shooting spells with a cold face.n<br/>
n“XXXXXXXX? XXX…”n<br/>
nHe has been talking in a language I have never heard before in a direction no one is in.n<br/>
n…No, is that the Spirit Language that Cain-sama uses rarely…?n<br/>
nIs he a Spirit User?n<br/>
nBut even if that’s the case…n<br/>
nHe looked over here with eyes that I can’t read…n<br/>
nHe slowly walks towards me.n<br/>
n“C-Come!” (Balam)n<br/>
nI take stance with the magic sword that has been passed down for generations, and pour all of my mana into it.n<br/>
n“Uooooooooooohhhh!!” (Balam)n<br/>
nMy ultimate technique that lowers my lifespan when used.n<br/>
nI put my all in this attack through my magic sword.n<br/>
n99 slashes that cut down any enemy into small pieces attack him.n<br/>
nBut…n<br/>
n“[Frozen Barrier].” (Makoto)n<br/>
nMy ultimate technique was blocked by a heartless ice barrier.n<br/>
nMy blade stopped without even reaching him.n<br/>
n“Kuh!” (Balam)n<br/>
nI fell on my knees after unleashing my strongest technique.n<br/>
nThe ground was frozen.n<br/>
nA cold wave was slowly creeping up.n<br/>
nAnd he approached me.n<br/>
nWhy is a mage closing the distance…?n<br/>
nBut this is my chance.n<br/>
nM-My last resort…n<br/>
nIt is an underhanded technique that’s unlike a warrior…n<br/>
n“Don’t, Makoto-san! The eyes of Balam are the magic eyes of fear! If you look at his eyes, you can’t move from the fear!” n<br/>
nThe Lightning Hero shouts, but it is too late.n<br/>
n“This is the end!!” (Balam)n<br/>
nI activate the Magic Eyes of Fear, and look at his eyes.n<br/>
nHe stopped moving…or was supposed to.n<br/>
nThis is the first time I felt fear after I made contact with the eyes of an enemyn.n<br/>
n“Aaah…aah…” n<br/>
nI couldn’t speak.n<br/>
nHe hasn’t been responding to me for a while now no matter how many times I called him.n<br/>
nI understand now.n<br/>
nLivestock that doesn’t even know how to introduce himself.n<br/>
nThat’s how I looked down on him.n<br/>
nThat in the end he was just a barbarian and not a warrior.n<br/>
nBut that wasn’t it.n<br/>
nHis eyes…the eyes he is using to look at me…were those of someone looking at an nant crawling on the groundn.n<br/>
nOr a mosquito flying close to the ear.n<br/>
nThe person that I acknowledged as my enemy was looking at me as if I were just a mere pebble on the road.n<br/>
nHe had no interest in me.n<br/>
nHe…didn’t think of me as his enemy.n<br/>
nI couldn’t move.n<br/>
nMy body has been frozen from water magic.n<br/>
nBut my body that has been given the blood of Bifrons-sama is undying.n<br/>
nNo one can kill me…is what I thought.n<br/>
nAnd yet, what’s this feeling?n<br/>
nI will be killedn.n<br/>
nDespairing fear was attacking me.n<br/>
nThat man unsheathed the dagger at his waist and raised it high.n<br/>
n“Water Goddess Eir-sama…I offer it to you.” (Makoto)n<br/>
nWater Goddess Eir! n<br/>
nSo you are the Water Hero, huh! n<br/>
nBut the Water Hero should have been killed by Cain-sama…n<br/>
nA new Hero was born?n<br/>
nNo matter how you see it, that’s way too fast! n<br/>
nNo, in the first place, the Water Hero is the weakest of Heroes that always gets killed first.n<br/>
nHe should be the Water Hero, but…n<br/>
nJust…what in the world are you?n<br/>
nMy head was in chaos, but I couldn’t move my body.n<br/>
nThe small dagger pierced my body.n<br/>
nThe next instant, small lights surround the area.n<br/>
n(Kuku…kuku…kuku…kuku…)n<br/>
n(Kya! Kya!)n<br/>
nWa?! n<br/>
nThey suddenly appeared in front of me…babies with small wings.n<br/>
nServants of the heavens that were smiling uglily with their teeth in full view -Angels.n<br/>
nThey began to neatn my body.n<br/>
n“AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAHHHHHHHH!!!” (Balam)n<br/>
nI screamed.n<br/>
nI am being eaten alive.n<br/>
nThe pain, fear, and most of all, my instincts understood that my soul itself was being eaten.n<br/>
nThis is impossible.n<br/>
nEven if I have received an undying body from the blood of the Demon Lord-sama, if my soul is eaten, I can’t revive.n<br/>
n“Momo, Abel-san, nI am donen.” n<br/>
nHe turned around and was returning to his comrades.n<br/>
n“…W-Wait! …Who in the world are you?!” (Balam)n<br/>
nI wrung out the last of my strength to ask this.n<br/>
nThere was no response.n<br/>
nBut he looked back.n<br/>
nAnd then, he looked at me as if in wonder.n<br/>
n“You can still talk?” n<br/>
nHe muttered as if pitying me.n<br/>
nAah…n<br/>
nHe is no Hero.n<br/>
nThe Heroes I have confronted until now have righteous indignation, had hatred because of the oppressed humans, were avengers that had their loved ones killed; all of them would move from powerful emotions.n<br/>
nBut he is different.n<br/>
nSense of righteousness, hatred, revenge; he has none of those.n<br/>
nIt was as if this were his ‘job’.n<br/>
nHe kills demons as if it were breathing.n<br/>
nA death god.n<br/>
nA death god for demons.n<br/>
nPlease be careful, Bifrons-sama.n<br/>
nThe abominable Gods of the heavens have sent an assassin.n<br/>
nPlease forgive me for perishing here.n<br/>
n—nI was eaten by the spell of the human that I looked down on as livestock…and died.n<br/>
n<br/>
