Chapter 64.3 : Moonlight’s Goddess<br/><br/>
That woman was… simply too beautiful.<br/><br/>
I could see her face clearly thanks to the full moon.<br/><br/>
She had an extremely well-ordered face and porcelain white skin. She had small red lips and eyes that gleamed like stars. And then, her most noticeable trait was her hair. Her silver colored hair that reflected the moonlight was quite a fantastical sight.<br/><br/>
I couldn’t take my eyes off of her.<br/><br/>
「What’s the matter, you a-」<br/><br/>
The butler-like man besides the woman suddenly cut in when the woman was about to say something.<br/><br/>
「Uhm… is something the matter?」<br/><br/>
The butler-like man was asking us. But, my brother’s eyes were still locked on the woman.<br/><br/>
「Eh… eer…」<br/><br/>
My brother was trying to say something, but it seems that he was too flustered.<br/><br/>
It’s natural. Afterall, this was the first time we’d seen such a beautiful woman.<br/><br/>
<br/>
I knew that my brother was really ecstatic right now.<br/><br/>
「Uhm… my apologies if we look like suspicious people to your honored knight but, we come from faraway to catch a glimpse of the Hero of Light. We definitely are not suspicious people.」<br/><br/>
Though the butler-like man was talking to my brother, my brother was still caught up in a daze. He simply couldn’t take his eyes off from the woman,<br/><br/>
The woman was looking at us with a doubtful look on her face.<br/><br/>
We might’ve accidentally disturbed her.<br/><br/>
「Nii-san!!」<br/><br/>
I brought my lips closer to his ear and called out to him.<br/><br/>
That seemed to have snapped him out of his daze.<br/><br/>
「Uhm…」<br/><br/>
「Look, you have yet to reply to him!!」<br/><br/>
「U-Uhm!! Please refrain from strolling around during the night since your life might be in danger if some hooligans target you!!!」<br/><br/>
My brother’s voice was all over the place.<br/><br/>
<br/>
And then, I looked for the woman’s reaction.<br/><br/>
She looked at my brother with piercing cold eyes as if to say, “What the h*ll is wrong with this dumb-looking man?”<br/><br/>
「I see… thanks for the warning. I guess we should take our leave.」<br/><br/>
After saying so, the butler-like man then left along with the silver haired woman.<br/><br/>
「She was so beautiful huh, Nii-san. You got unintentionally charmed by her, you know.」<br/><br/>
I called out to my brother from behind, but he didn’t react at all.<br/><br/>
「Wait a minute, Nii-san?」<br/><br/>
Despite my calls, his eyes were steadfastly locked in the direction where those two people had gone.<br/><br/>
「Goddess… she’s a Moonlight… Goddess.」<br/><br/>
My brother muttered so.<br/><br/>
He had this entranced face as he said that.<br/><br/>
I’d finally witnessed the moment my brother had fallen in love.<br/><br/>
<br/>

Dark Knight; Kuroki<br/><br/>
「Welcome back, Master(Husband), Kuna-sama.」<br/><br/>
Regena welcomed us as we returned to the Tormalkins’ second residence.<br/><br/>
I’d been in the middle of a night stroll with Kuna until just a bit ago.<br/><br/>
We’d decided to take a stroll around the city since it was still too early to sleep.<br/><br/>
「Uhm, Thanks for waiting for our return, Regena.」<br/><br/>
Kuna spoke proudly as she puffed out her ch*st.<br/><br/>
Her attitude had become akin to that of the lady of the house.<br/><br/>
「Thanks for waiting for our return, Regena.」<br/><br/>
I also thanked Regena.<br/><br/>
「Fufufu, thank you for the praise, Master. Did you enjoy your night stroll?」<br/><br/>
<br/>
「I’ve enjoyed it, Regena. Ariadya has far bigger population compared to other countries.」<br/><br/>
Even from my perspective, the Republic of Ariadya was the largest human country.<br/><br/>
Though the outside was typically enveloped by total darkness in the other countries once night came, the Republic of Ariadya was still bright during the night and had many places for amusement. But, since there were so many indecent things around those places, I refrained from visiting those places with Kuna.<br/><br/>
According to my research, the inns in this world also served dinner.<br/><br/>
Since the majority of these inn owners were the followers of the God of Liquor, Nectar, most of the inns around here had Nector’s holy crest hung at this storefront.<br/><br/>
The guests could enjoy food, beverage, or gambling on the first floor, the dining room. And then, they could use the second floor to sleep, or invite a female worker of the inn who was also working as a harlot up there.<br/><br/>
No matter what world it was, the majority of amusement for men remained the same with liquor, brawling, and women.<br/><br/>
But, this practice of prostitution was an open secret in the country whose main religion was the Goddess Faeria’s faith. The reason being that no one could suppress their innate human lust. That’s why it remained an open secret.<br/><br/>
Thus, we really were just strolling since I didn’t want to bring Kuna into such a place.<br/><br/>
Fortunately for us, the moon tonight was really beautiful.<br/><br/>
The figure of Kuna walking under the moonlight as her silver hair reflected the moonlight was simply wondrous and beautiful.<br/><br/>
I couldn’t help but notice that Kuna had become even more beautiful than before.<br/><br/>
<br/>
I simply couldn’t take my eyes off of Kuna.<br/><br/>
Moreover, the person herself didn’t seem to realize my gaze on her.<br/><br/>
And then, as we were enjoying our moon viewing together, a male knight in the middle of his patrol called out to us and ended up being charmed by Kuna’s beauty.<br/><br/>
Even though he was talking to me, I knew that he couldn’t look away from Kuna.<br/><br/>
Most likely, Kuna had already forgotten about the existence of that knight by now.<br/><br/>
That knight might not have realized it, but Kuna had almost killed him with her magic. He really might’ve died if I hadn’t cut in back then.<br/><br/>
Plus, that knight had a companion, a beauty.<br/><br/>
Seeing that she’d called him “nii-san,” could it be that they’re actually a pair of siblings?<br/><br/>
I mean, they didn’t give off the impression of being a couple.<br/><br/>
「By the way, have you prepared “THAT”, Regena?」<br/><br/>
Kuna suddenly asked such a question to Regena.<br/><br/>
「Yes, Kuna-sama. I’ve prepared the bath.」<br/><br/>
<br/>
「I see. Let’s take a bath together, Kuroki.」<br/><br/>
Kuna pulled me along as she spoke.<br/><br/>
「Eh… that’ll be bad right? I mean, Regena is here too.」<br/><br/>
Things would turn out really bad in various ways, mainly for my lower half.<br/><br/>
「It’s okay, Kuroki. I’ll allow Regena to bath with us since I’m in a really good mood tonight. Now, the problem is gone, right?」<br/><br/>
Kuna smiled coquettishly as she spoke.<br/><br/>
What a great ide– No, that’ll cause even more problems, mainly for my lower half.<br/><br/>
In the first place, Regena might hat–<br/><br/>
「REALLY!! THANK YOU VERY MUCH, KUNA-SAMA!! WELL THEN, I’M JOINING IN TOO!!」<br/><br/>
And yet, contrary to my expectations, she was jumping with joy.<br/><br/>
Thus, Regena joined in and dragged me into the bathroom.<br/><br/>
I, on the other hand, was powerless against their combined force.<br/><br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Though I was far more powerful than them, I couldn’t muster up my strength to oppose them.<br/><br/>
===<br/><br/>

Small Time Villain, Marchas<br/><br/>
I walked along the dark and narrow road.<br/><br/>
I could never feel good about this place no matter how many times I came here.<br/><br/>
After walking for a while, I arrived at an open place. There were a few women in that place. Those women, all of them were wearing a black attire.<br/><br/>
And then, a goat-headed demon, a Satyr’s statue was placed in the innermost part of the palace where those women had gathered.<br/><br/>
This place was an altar. It seems that these women were offering their prayers until just a moment ago.<br/><br/>
「You’ve come, Marchas.」<br/><br/>
One of the women was looking at me.<br/><br/>
She was a beauty that looked to be in the midst of her twenties. But, I knew that wasn’t her real appearance.<br/><br/>
「Hehehe, Ainoe-neesan. Do you have some kind of business for calling me to this place? I’m a busy man you see. I’ve to perform in front of that hero tomorrow after all.」<br/><br/>
<br/>
I spoke to her with a servile smile on my face.<br/><br/>
「This matter is related to that, Marchas. Tomorrow, you’ll perform in front of the Hero with that creepy lass, right? I’m not even invited you see.」<br/><br/>
Ainoe spoke with a vexed tone.<br/><br/>
The creepy girl she was referring to was Sienna. A girl whose feet I wanted to lick the most.<br/><br/>
Ainoe hated Sienna.<br/><br/>
She was the star actress of 「Donkey’s Ear」 until just a bit ago. But, that title was not in Sienna’s hand.<br/><br/>
It seems that she couldn’t accept the fact that her position as the troupe’s leading actress had been taken by Sienna. In addition, it looked like she couldn’t stomach the fact that Sienna was appointed to person in front of the hero in tomorrow’s performance.<br/><br/>
Even though I was nominated too, I was nothing more than a freebie.<br/><br/>
Tomorrow, Sienna would have to dance while I played my flute in a Satyr’s costume. In short, I’m just to be the clown of that performance.<br/><br/>
「Well, it can’t be helped. A job is a job after all.」<br/><br/>
I shook my head while raising both of my hands.<br/><br/>
「Humph, whatever. Take this, Marchas.」<br/><br/>
<br/>
Ainoe held something in her hand.<br/><br/>
「Is this, a flute?」<br/><br/>
I looked at the flute that was given to me.<br/><br/>
I looked at the flute that was given to me.<br/><br/>
「Indeed, you’ll perform with this flute. It’ll call a monster that you will be able to control with this flute. In addition, I want you to kill that girl with this.」<br/><br/>
Ainoe ordered me so without even batting her eyes.<br/><br/>
「Kill… Sienna?」<br/><br/>
I never thought that Ainoe hated Sienna to the point of wanting her killed.<br/><br/>
「Yes… kill that girl. Make it to look like you’re aiming for the guest. Nothing will happen to us as long as they have no idea who’s the culprit.」<br/><br/>
Ainoe had an enraptured face as she said those words.<br/><br/>
This woman was insane.<br/><br/>
The women at her side were giggling upon seeing her.<br/><br/>
<br/>
Every one of them was a witch. Every single one of them had gained a supernatural ability through their relationship with the Black Satyr.<br/><br/>
And I was their scapegoat.<br/><br/>
I looked at the flute in my hand.<br/><br/>
There was a black goat’s head crest inscribed on it.<br/><br/>
