<br/>
It looks like I have become the believer of an Evil God.<br/>
"T-Takki-dono?" (Fujiwara)<br/>
"…This is a problem." (Makoto)<br/>
The good mood of this friend reunion has fallen in an instant.<br/>
It is true that that Goddess was suspicious.<br/>
But to think she would be an Evil God.<br/>
She got me there.<br/>
"What’s an Evil God to begin with." (Makoto)<br/>
"Uhm, if I remember the myths correctly, it is what the old gods that were defeated in the God Realm War are now called." (Fujiwara) <br/>
The rulers of the God Realm that stand at the summit of the world. <br/>
According to mythology, the world has changed rulers 3 times in the past. <br/>
The Creation God that created the world.<br/>
The Creation God left one day from this world.<br/>
The next rulers were the sons and daughters of the Creation God.<br/>
Their rule continued for a long time.<br/>
Eventually, the Old Gods became arrogant, looked down on others aside from themselves as lower beings, and treated them rudely.<br/>
The ones who went against that were the current rulers, the Holy Gods. <br/>
After that, a war between the Old Gods and the Holy Gods that had the king of Gods, Jupiter, as their top began.<br/>
The God Realm War, Titanomaquia. <br/>
After an intense war, the Holy Gods side won.  <br/>
They are the current rulers of the God Realm. <br/>
And so, the Old Gods are now called Evil Gods. <br/>
I did learn about that myth in the Water Temple.<br/>
"It seems like the Goddess I am a believer of is an Old God then. The Old Gods are currently confined somewhere, and continue to aim for the recapture of the God Realm, is how the story goes, right?" (Makoto)<br/>
"The Goddess you made a contract with seems to be one of them." (Fujiwara)<br/>
"This is troubling." (Makoto)<br/>
She was such a dangerous Goddess?<br/>
"Takki-dono, you are going to continue being the believer of such a Goddess?" (Fujiwara)<br/>
 Fuji-yan asks me worried.<br/>
"Hmm…" (Makoto)<br/>
My head is still in chaos right now.<br/>
Being unable to say anything, and seeing me stay in silence, Fuji-yan changed the topic.<br/>
"By the way, this dagger is amazing, you know! I appraised not only the name of the weapon, but its abilities too!" (Fujiwara)<br/>
I see.<br/>
It certainly did have shocking sharpness.<br/>
"So, what abilities does it have?" (Makoto)<br/>
"The material is the legendary metal, adamantite. There’s a lot of abilities endowed to it with the power of a God. [Godly Strike], [Indestructible], [Beheading Demon], [Mana Resonance], [Spirit Resonance]…there’s also a lot of abilities that I have not heard of before. There’s other things like…" (Fujiwara)<br/>
"O-Ooh…" (Makoto)<br/>
Fuji-yan explained the abilities of the dagger in detail. <br/>
Eh? Isn’t this a cheat weapon?<br/>
"Could this possibly be amazing?" (Makoto)<br/>
"It IS amazing! It is by far the best weapon I have seen within all the ones I have worked with! This is a weapon that could be treated as a national treasure, you know?!" (Fujiwara)<br/>
"I see." (Makoto)<br/>
Fumu, so that part about being a divine treasure was true. <br/>
This is the first cheat I got since coming to this world.<br/>
A contract with an Evil God in exchange though.<br/>
"Goddess-sama, thank you for giving me something this good." (Makoto)<br/>
I put both of my hands together and prayed. <br/>
"Is it okay that it ended up being an Evil God?" (Fujiwara)<br/>
"I will have to question her about that." (Makoto)<br/>
"But it would be hard to meet her." (Fujiwara)<br/>
"I wonder about that. She might be listening to this conversation right now." (Makoto)<br/>
"Seriously?" (Fujiwara)<br/>
Fuji-yan looks around restlessly.<br/>
She did say she was always watching.<br/>
Are you watching, Goddess-sama?<br/>
(……..)<br/>
No response.<br/>
Oh well.<br/>
"I will think carefully about whether to continue as her believer or not." (Makoto)<br/>
"I see. If I can be of help somehow… There might not be anything I can do, but please consult with me if you need to." (Fujiwara)<br/>
"Thanks." (Makoto)<br/>
Fuji-yan finished gulping down his ale.<br/>
By the way, this is his third one.<br/>
After that, he asked the waitress for a drink on the rocks.<br/>
"Fuji-yan, you can really hold your alcohol." (Makoto)<br/>
I am still on my first one and it still has around half left.<br/>
"I am made to drink all the time as a merchant." (Fujiwara)<br/>
The bitter smile of Fuji-yan was that of an experienced man.<br/>
"I don’t think I can become a merchant then." (Makoto)<br/>
I can’t drink that much.<br/>
"I will take it slow as an adventurer." (Makoto)<br/>
I take only a small sip of my glass.<br/>
"By the way, have you heard about this? The Great Demon Lord is apparently going to revive in 10 years." (Fujiwara)<br/>
First time I heard of that.<br/>
"I didn’t know. Is that true?" (Makoto)<br/>
"That’s the rumor that’s been spreading around. The countries are denying it though. All 6 Oracles excluding the Moon one apparently received an oracle like that." (Fujiwara)<br/>
"I didn’t know that. If that’s the case, the guys that were chosen as heroes are gonna have it rough." (Makoto)<br/>
Like the Light Hero Sakurai-kun.<br/>
At any rate, the Demon Lord, huh.<br/>
If I were stronger, I would have wanted to try challenging it.<br/>
"Just between you and me, there seems to be rumors that we might have been called to this world to fight the Demon Lord." (Fujiwara)<br/>
Fuji-yan whispers this to me.<br/>
"That does sound plausible, but if that’s the case, I would have liked more powerful skills." (Makoto)<br/>
"No no, I am not good at fighting. Being a merchant fits just fine for me." (Fujiwara)<br/>
I personally would like skills that make me stronger in battle.<br/>
"I have heard that each nation is gathering military power in preparation for the battle against the Demon Lord." (Fujiwara)<br/>
"Aah, so that’s why there were so many scouts coming to the Water Temple from a variety of countries." (Makoto)<br/>
Fuji-yan is an information network. It is really helpful.<br/>
"By the way, what do you plan on doing from now on, Takki-dono?" (Fujiwara)<br/>
"I will raise my level as an adventurer for a while." (Makoto)<br/>
"If it is okay with you, do you want to form a party with me?" (Fujiwara)<br/>
"With you, Fuji-yan?" (Makoto)<br/>
Can a merchant fight?<br/>
Didn’t he say he wasn’t good at fighting?<br/>
According to him, merchants can’t fight, but they can hire adventurers to do things like exploring dungeons.<br/>
He did say that the clerk I met at noon was a Silver Rank adventurer.<br/>
If I go together with the fighting force that Fuji-yan hired with his money, I will be able to have safe adventures.<br/>
It is enticing.<br/>
But…that’s way too lukewarm.<br/>
"Thanks for the offer, but I will try to do my best solo first. I did train in the temple for the sake of that after all." (Makoto)<br/>
"I see, that’s a shame. But if you have a problem with anything, feel free to give me a call." (Fujiwara)<br/>
I am really grateful for that. <br/>
One should really have a good classmate friend.<br/>
After that, we had fun talking about memories of our previous world, and the fun memories we had in this world.<br/>
The memories of our previous world are, as always, about games.<br/>
It has already been a year, so we definitely must be missing a lot of titles. <br/>
Fuji-yan said he ate a whole lot of food from around the continent, and it seems like the level is unexpectedly high and praised it.<br/>
But it seems he didn’t like the fact that there’s no ramen in this world.<br/>
So he was talking about making a ramen chain one day.<br/>
I would like to eat hamburgers.<br/>
In the past, I would pass my days eating things like cheese burgers, potatoes, and drinking cola while playing games.<br/>
Aah, I miss those days.<br/>
"You are way too unhealthy, Takki-dono. Passing 3 days without sleeping while eating only hamburgers and potatoes is crazy." (Fujiwara)<br/>
"I don’t want to hear that from you who ate ramen and curry for breakfast." (Makoto)<br/>
"I haven’t been able to do that now." (Fujiwara)<br/>
"You end up being healthy in this world. Our meals in the temple would be bland vegetable soup with rice gruel." (Makoto)<br/>
"That was indeed bland. You should go to the Commercial Country, Camelon, one day. That place is the country of the rich, and the food is delicious." (Fujiwara)<br/>
We talked till late in the night.<br/>
We left probably when it had already passed midnight.<br/>
Fuji-yan invited me again and again to stay in his house, but I didn’t want to impose so much on him, so I refused.<br/>
He did pay for all the food after all.<br/>
Next time, it will be my treat.<br/>
I went to the resting room for adventurer use in the Adventurer Guild, and wrapped myself at a corner of the large room. And so, I passed my first night as an adventurer.<br/>
It was noisy with the snoring and sleep-talking of the adventurers, but I was tired, so I managed to fall asleep pretty quick.<br/>
◇◇<br/>
That night, I dreamed again.<br/>
A space with nothing.<br/>
It’s been one day since last time.<br/>
"…What are you doing, Goddess-sama?" (Makoto)<br/>
The Goddess was prostrating.<br/>
Her back was completely straight and her hands positioned diagonally from each other on the ground.<br/>
Apparently showing the top of your head is a display of submission towards the other party.<br/>
Her nape that’s peeking out slightly is a bit sexy.<br/>
No wait, that’s not it.<br/>
"Noah-sama." (Makoto)<br/>
I kindly call her.<br/>
The Goddess’s shoulders quiver.<br/>
"That’s your name right, Goddess-sama?" (Makoto)<br/>
"……..Yes." (Noah)<br/>
She tells me in a fleeting voice.<br/>
"You were an Evil God?" (Makoto)<br/>
"…"<br/>
There’s no answer.<br/>
"For now, please show me your face. Staying prostrated won’t let me relax." (Makoto)<br/>
"You won’t stop being my believer?" (Noah)<br/>
"……"<br/>
"Please don’t stay silent!" (Noah)<br/>
She snapped her head up, stood up, and grabbed my shoulders.<br/>
"I am sorry! I didn’t intend to deceive you. I simply didn’t say it." (Noah)<br/>
That’s called a fraud.<br/>
"It is not a fraud! Also, there’s no mistake that I am a Goddess!" (Noah)<br/>
"But you are an Old God, right?" (Makoto)<br/>
"Calling me old is also a bit… I don’t really like that way of calling us. Within the Titan Gods, I am on the young side, you know." (Noah)<br/>
She sulks and makes a gesture of kicking the air.<br/>
As cute as always.<br/>
Ah, she grinned.<br/>
Right, she can read minds.<br/>
"Cute Goddess-sama, looks like you will be okay even if I am not your believer anymore." (Makoto)<br/>
The face of the Goddess stiffens.<br/>
"I won’t I won’t I wont!! It took me a 1,000 years to even get one believer, you know?! Without believers, a God will stay weak. I am being treated as an Evil God, so I can’t get believers. I can only recruit otherworldlers!" (Noah)<br/>
And most of those otherworldlers were seized by the six Great Goddesses.<br/>
"H-Hey, the dagger was good, right?" (Noah)<br/>
"This?" (Makoto)<br/>
I look at the dagger at my waist.<br/>
Based on what Fuji-yan said, it certainly is an impressive weapon.<br/>
It isn’t something I would have been able to obtain by adventuring normally in this world.<br/>
"But getting caught as an Evil God from an Appraisal was a bit careless of your part." (Makoto)<br/>
"That’s not it! A normal appraisal wouldn’t have managed to!" (Noah)<br/>
So Fuji-yan’s skill isn’t normal.<br/>
That’s an [Appraisal: Superior] for ya.<br/>
Or more like, you totally intended on deceiving me then.<br/>
"No, well, you see…" (Noah)<br/>
The Goddess fidgets. <br/>
Looks like she can’t find a good excuse.<br/>
Well, she did hide that she was an Evil God, but the quality of the weapon she gave me is the real deal.<br/>
I wasn’t given a weapon at the Water Temple, so having this dagger and not having it makes a lot of difference.<br/>
Then, what I should say is…<br/>
"Noah-sama, thank you for this dagger. I will use it with care." (Makoto)<br/>
"I am glad that you like it." (Noah)<br/>
She smiles.<br/>
When looking at her like this, she really doesn’t look like an Evil God at all.<br/>
"No, it is just the Holy Gods arbitrarily calling us Evil Gods. I am also a Goddess." (Noah)<br/>
She puckers her lips and says this.<br/>
I see. <br/>
Apparently Goddesses can’t lie.<br/>
Fuji-yan told me that.<br/>
So her saying she is a Goddess is not a lie.<br/>
When thinking about it in that way, our conversation the first time wasn’t a fraud. <br/>
"I am okay staying as your believer." (Makoto)<br/>
"R-Really?!" (Noah)<br/>
"Yeah." (Makoto)<br/>
Honestly, I was happy.<br/>
This Goddess was the only one who has told me ‘I have high hopes for you’ since coming to this world.<br/>
Other people only made fun of me, pitied me, or worried about me.  <br/>
Aah, but she is reading my mind.<br/>
Maybe it really was pity?<br/>
While I was thinking that, the Goddess suddenly approached me.<br/>
"Makoto." (Noah)<br/>
And hugged me.<br/>
"You are my important believer. I have high hopes for you, so slowly become stronger." (Noah)<br/>
"This is so obvious that it stinks of fake, you know." (Makoto)<br/>
"S-So horrible! I did my best there!" (Noah)<br/>
She lightly beats my head.<br/>
I am sorry. <br/>
[Clear Mind] and [RPG Player] are just too good at their job, you see.<br/>
Seeing from the side my own figure being hugged by the Goddess is embarrassing.<br/>
Anyways, the contract still stands.<br/>
I will do my best as a believer of the Goddess Noah-sama.<br/>
"By the way, don’t you have any instructions for me, Goddess-sama?" (Makoto)<br/>
"Why is it that you want such an oracle that much?" (Noah)<br/>
"Meeting a Goddess and the only event is receiving a dagger, is just a bit, you know…" (Makoto)<br/>
Most times it is ‘defeat the Demon Lord’ or something unreasonable.<br/>
It is kinda the usual trope of an RPG.<br/>
"What a weird believer." (Noah)<br/>
The Goddess says with a troubled expression.<br/>
"Then, how about this? I am currently imprisoned for the sin of going against the Holy Gods. How does saving me sound?" (Noah)<br/>
Ooh, nice!<br/>
A classic event.<br/>
Saving the captured Goddess.<br/>
I have dreamed of situations like this.<br/>
Right right, that’s the kind of thing I wanted.<br/>
"The place where the Old Gods are imprisoned in, right?" (Makoto)<br/>
"Aah, that’s a different place. The place where the Old Gods are imprisoned in, Tartaros, cannot be reached by a mortal in the first place. I am still a young god, so I am in a different place. It is a place that a mortal can just baaarely get to." (Noah)<br/>
Really?<br/>
So there’s a lot of things that can’t be learned with only the passed down myths.<br/>
"The place I am currently in, you see, is the Deep Sea Temple." (Noah)<br/>
"Eh? What did you say just now?" (Makoto)<br/>
"At the abyss of the deep sea. The dungeon that’s said to be the deepest in this world. The Deep Sea Temple is in the very last location of that place." (Noah)<br/>
The Goddess Noah-sama just said the name of one of the 3 top most difficult dungeons in the world.<br/>
A dungeon that mankind has not reached yet.<br/>
"Ahaha, want to call it quits after all?" (Noah)<br/>
The Goddess asks me with a smile.<br/>
"I will go. I will aim for it. I will save you as thanks for this dagger." (Makoto)<br/>
"The dagger is my thanks for you becoming my believer. You don’t have to mind it. If you pray everyday, you might eventually get a divine protection, so it would benefit you to continue being my believer, you know." (Noah)<br/>
The Goddess speaks as if she is making a sales pitch for a newspaper subscription.<br/>
"Well, excuse me. Then, it is about time you wake up." (Noah)<br/>
My consciousness grows hazy. <br/>
"Come rescue me when you feel like it, okay? I will wait patiently." (Noah)<br/>
Noah-sama waves her hand all smiles.<br/>
I only have 10 years of lifespan though.<br/>
For now, let’s raise my level and earn lifespan.<br/>
"If you free me, I will do whatever you want me to~." (Noah)<br/>
I heard that voice as my consciousness grew further and further away.<br/>
Aren’t you just saying random stuff without meaning it, Goddess-sama?<br/>
 ◇◇<br/>
I wake up and look at the back of my hand.<br/>
The crest is there as always.<br/>
My Soul Book has Goddess Noah’s Believer written in it.<br/>
I am glad it doesn’t say Evil God.<br/>
(I will do my best, Noah-sama.) (Makoto)<br/>
I hold the dagger in both hands, and offer a prayer. <br/>
"Okay, let’s do this." (Makoto)<br/>
Today will be the day my life in Makkaren starts!<br/>
I come out from the resting area of the Adventurer Guild and head to the reception. <br/>
It is early morning so it is free.<br/>
"Uhm, with the level and adventurer rank of Takatsuki-san, it would be around here." <br/>
The quests that the guild receptionist recommended me were.<br/>
<br/>
Hunt horn rabbits in the great forest (3). <br/>
A porter for a trip to the Fire Country by carriage (includes 2 meals and lodging).<br/>
A porter for a trip to the Sun Country by carriage (includes 3 meals and lodging).<br/>
<br/>
They were all errands.<br/>
"Is there no quests like monster subjugation?" (Makoto)<br/>
"You are acting solo, right? Lately, there have only been subjugation quests for parties." <br/>
"I see… Then, the horn rabbit hunt quest." (Makoto)<br/>
"Understood. By the way, you can kill or capture goblins and orcs. They are quests that are always active, so there will be a reward for it too." <br/>
Hoh, is that so. <br/>
"At your level, I think it would be difficult to kill them, so it would be better to run away." <br/>
She warned me.<br/>
Well, I haven’t fought orcs before.<br/>
If I meet one, I will check the situation first.<br/>
"Are there any questions?" <br/>
"No, I am okay." (Makoto)<br/>
"I see, then, do your best. Next one please." <br/>
I leave the Adventurer Guild and head to the west gate. <br/>
I showed my guild license to the gatekeeper and he easily let me pass.<br/>
He gave me a ‘do your best’.<br/>
I bowed lightly and headed to the forest.<br/>
My destination is the Great Forest.<br/>
—Great Forest—<br/>
The Tree Country Spring Log neighbors the Water Country Rozes.<br/>
Most of it is comprised of forests.<br/>
Inside the Great Forest, there’s a natural dungeon called the Forest of the Lost, also called the Demonic Forest, which is filled with strong monsters.<br/>
By the way, at the back of the Water Temple I trained for 1 year, there’s the Spirit Forest that’s within the Great Forest, and it is famous for being a safe place where no monsters show up.<br/>
This time’s quest is to capture Horn Rabbits that inhabit a wide area of the Great Forest. <br/>
A rabbit with a horn on its head that has the cute appearance of an animal.<br/>
It doesn’t attack people, but it is a harmful monster that devastates farms.<br/>
Because of that, there’s quests to deal with them.<br/>
Their meat is apparently suited for consumption.<br/>
According to the book I read, it is a light brown rabbit that has a small horn on its forehead, but as it grows, the horn also grows. <br/>
[Water Magic: Ice Arrow]<br/>
I approach it with [Stealth], and before it notices me, I shoot an [Ice Arrow].<br/>
The power of my magic is so low, that I couldn’t kill it with that, so I finish it with my dagger.<br/>
I soon finished hunting the 3 I needed.<br/>
I was thinking about going back now, but my Detection skill has been ringing for a while now. <br/>
This feeling, goblins.<br/>
There’s probably a goblin colony around here.<br/>
I don’t have much knowledge about the geography of the Great Forest, but from the information I gathered beforehand, this place should be close to the Demonic Forest. <br/>
The strong monsters are in the deep parts of the Demonic Forest.<br/>
The weak ones are at the beginnings of it.<br/>
(There’s around 40.) (Makoto)<br/>
10 times the amount I fought before.<br/>
Thinking about it normally, the only choice would be to run away.<br/>
But the vicinity of the Demonic Forest is covered in a thick mist, and the visibility is close to zero.<br/>
I have Detection and Night Vision, so there’s no problem.<br/>
(There’s a number of them that are moving alone.) (Makoto)<br/>
If I use Stealth to defeat them one by one, I might be able to reduce their numbers.<br/>
(What should I do?) (Makoto)<br/>
Run ←<br/>
Fight<br/>
[RPG Player] is reading the mood and showing me choices.<br/>
I will report this to the guild, but since I am here, it should be okay to defeat them, right?<br/>
(Don’t raise a weird flag!)<br/>
I feel like I heard someone say that.<br/>
Goddess, you are watching me too much.<br/>
I erased the sound of my footsteps, and silently creeped my way to 1 goblin.<br/>
