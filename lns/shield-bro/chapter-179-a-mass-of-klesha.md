NAAAOOOOFFFUUUMMMIIII!!! CCCOOOMMMEEE BAAACCCKKKK!!!!<br/>
Chapter 179: A Mass of Klesha (TL: Google it)<br/>
"It should be somewhere around here." (Naofumi)<br/>
I climb the mountain, only to find that the ecosystem here is just as messed up as ever.<br/>
The soil is polluted, and it feels like the flow of magic here is abnormal.<br/>
I never thought that I’d have to return here someday.<br/>
Taniko stares back at the village with angry eyes. What exactly is she mad about?<br/>
Last time, Firo was able to send all of the monsters we encountered flying, but this time is different.<br/>
We wasted time fighting the battles.<br/>
Though having Sadina, Rat, Taniko and Melty here sped things up.<br/>
"I lead the flow of the power of the land, and give it the power of incarnation. Earth Pulse, become my power.「Dark Firebolt」!" (Taniko)<br/>
Taniko’s magic summons black flames that burn the monsters.<br/>
The incantation seems to be fundamentally different from the magic I know of.<br/>
"Her magic seems to concentrate the surrounding energy and release it." (Melty)<br/>
"It really is a strange magic." (Naofumi)<br/>
"Yeah… I’ve only learned the basics, but this is a magic that borrows powers from the surroundings." (Taniko)<br/>
"I see." (Naofumi)<br/>
"Father could use much more powerful magic." (Taniko)<br/>
Taniko continues casting her strange spells. I wonder what sort of mage her father was.<br/>
Rat looks at the magic and cocks her head.<br/>
"That magic is…" (Rat)<br/>
"You know it?" (Naofumi)<br/>
"It doesn’t seem to be a power of human or demi-human origin." (Rat)<br/>
But Taniko is a demi-human, right?<br/>
She has dog-ish ears and everything.<br/>
I never asked her exactly what race she was, because I wasn’t interested, though.<br/>
"Could she have received special protection from something?" (Rat)<br/>
(TL: as in Divine protection, divine gifts.)<br/>
"By the way, what sort of magic can you use?" (Naofumi)<br/>
"Recovery Magic." (Rat)<br/>
"Ah, I see. I’ll leave support to you." (Naofumi)<br/>
"That’s what I planned on doing anyways." (Rat)<br/>
Sadina eliminates the remaining monsters in silence.<br/>
"It’s not widely known, but it isn’t an extinct form of magic. Perhaps I should teach her some advanced spells." (Sadina)<br/>
Sadina spins her harpoon and begins to cast magic on the monsters that begin appearing in great numbers. She pulls out a canteen of water and holds it out.<br/>
"I, Sadina, Draw out the power of Water to do my bidding. Dragon Pulse, eliminate my enemies. 「Saint Aquabolt」!" (Sadina)<br/>
Using a similar chant as Taniko, Sadina unleashes a shining mass of water.<br/>
Everyone there is taken aback.<br/>
"By the way, I can also use the main varieties of magic as well." (Sadina)<br/>
"I who has understood the origin of power command you. Once again be read and come forth. Pierce all with spheres of water, 「Faust Aquashot」!" (Sadina)<br/>
She takes out another monster with a magic I am familiar with.<br/>
It seems Sadina is needlessly skillful.<br/>
It’s not like she was hiding anything, I just don’t know too much about her in general.<br/>
"Understand? Magic that takes from one’s surroundings has power proportional to the surrounding environment. Make sure to prepare things to aid you beforehand." (Sadina)<br/>
Sadina hands the canteen to Taniko.<br/>
"This flask contains holy water, so it works well on the monsters of this land. But if you use it to much, the effectiveness drops so be careful." (Sadina)<br/>
"G-got it." (Taniko)<br/>
"If you’re really in a tight situation, you can try borrowing power from the sky. It’s hard to control, though." (Sadina)<br/>
"Amazing, you can use the same magic as father." (Taniko)<br/>
"Only a little. I usually use magic that changes the flow of energy in my own body." (Sadina)<br/>
"What sort of magic is that?" (Naofumi)<br/>
That sounds convenient, of course it’s not like I’ll be able to learn it.<br/>
"Humans and Demi-Humans need special blessings to learn it, so it’s rare. Perhaps Naofumi-chan will be able to use it." (Sadina)<br/>
"What do you mean?" (Naofumi)<br/>
"Ah, but with Firo-chan here, that might be difficult." (Sadina)<br/>
I can’t learn it if I’m with Firo?<br/>
I’m getting more and more curious as to what sort of magic it is.<br/>
"… Are you possibly referring to that?" (Rat)<br/>
Rat seems to have figured something out. She addresses Sadina.<br/>
"One of the extinct magics. Currently only known and passed down by high class monsters, Dragon Pulse Order?" (Rat)<br/>
"Correct. I was once taught it a long time ago." (Sadina)<br/>
"T-that’s kinda amazing." (Melty)<br/>
Melty seems to have never heard of it before.<br/>
"Ah, Melty-chan might have the aptitude for Choral Magic." (Sadina)<br/>
"Eh!?" (Melty)<br/>
Choral Magic? What’s that?<br/>
Is it similar to ritual magic?<br/>
In the magic books I’ve read, was that magic there? I think I’ve heard about it before, but I can’t remember where.<br/>
"Impossible, Impossible, not happening." (Melty)<br/>
"It’s fine. Melty-chan. Even your hair color signifies that you have the talent. Trust me." (Sadina)<br/>
Melty is frantically denying it.<br/>
Ah, I think Choral Magic was that thing Bitch was doing. Casting several magics at once.<br/>
"Anyways, you have the Talent, Melty-chan. Work hard." (Sadina)<br/>
"Uuu…." (Melty)<br/>
Even so, Melty’s level isn’t that high. I don’t think you should expect that much from her.<br/>
"I’ll teach you when you’re ready. Shall I lecture on magic as we head there?" (Sadina)<br/>
This has somehow begun to feel like a Picnic. You know, Firo’s life is on the line here…<br/>
Anyways, we talk as we climb up the mountain. We arrive at the area that the Dragon Zombie had previously lain. It’s been 3 hours since we set out.<br/>
There isn’t a single blade of grass growing in the area.<br/>
Even now, this land is heavily polluted…<br/>
"Where could Gaelion be?" (Naofumi)<br/>
"… I think that way." (Taniko)<br/>
Taniko points further up the mountain.<br/>
What?<br/>
As if answering her statement, black fog begins rising from that area.<br/>
"My, my… That seems quite ominous." (Rat)<br/>
"But we have to go." (Taniko)<br/>
Taniko begins to lead the party.<br/>
"You know the way?" (Naofumi)<br/>
"Yeah… This way." (Taniko)<br/>
Taniko seems familiar with the area as she leads the party.<br/>
"I see, so that’s it." (Sadina)<br/>
"What? What happened?" (Naofumi)<br/>
Sadina seems to have figured something out. If you don’t explain it, I won’t get it.<br/>
"Naofumi-chan, are you the type of person that digs up people’s pasts? Shall I tell you this Onee-san’s past?" (Sadina)<br/>
"Don’t care!" (Naofumi)<br/>
She seems to be dodging the subject.<br/>
Past? Did Taniko live here before?<br/>
Was she part of a reclusive village of Demi-humans that lived with the dragon… This area’s population died out from plague. Perhaps she had tried to escape it and gotten sold off.<br/>
And the magic was passed down through that village.<br/>
Was it something like that?<br/>
…<br/>
"There!" (Taniko)<br/>
Two hours later, Taniko suddenly jumps and begins pointing. Of course, we had to fight a lot of monsters on the way. Firo’s remaining time is running out, yet we were wasting time on the way here.<br/>
Gaelion is lying down in front of a cave.<br/>
Is he asleep? He’s not moving at all.<br/>
We remain hidden as we approach him.<br/>
If we can get close enough, I can seal him with Shield Prison. After that, we can prepare magics and release them the moment the prison vanishes to weaken him. And then Rat can use her drug.<br/>
After that, I’ll just need to get Gaelion to spit up the core.<br/>
But that’s just the best case scenario.<br/>
Shield Prison’s range is 5 meters. We are 20 meters from Gaelion.<br/>
I analyze him. His level is 55. He’s stolen more than 20 levels from Firo.<br/>
"GYAOOO!" (Gaelion)<br/>
Gaelion suddenly opens his eyes and rushes into the cave.<br/>
"Damn!" (Naofumi)<br/>
A failure.<br/>
But now we can trap him in the cave.<br/>
We carefully peer into the cave.<br/>
Gaelion seems to be scampering around the cave, frantically looking for something.<br/>
"What is he doing?" (Naofumi)<br/>
"I think he is looking for his treasure… The villagers took it already." (Taniko)<br/>
"Dragons have a habit of collecting things. I think the soul in the core Gaelion ate had some lingering affections for his treasure." (Rat)<br/>
I see, so Dragons are that sort of lifeform.<br/>
"…" (Taniko)<br/>
Taniko quietly murmurs something.<br/>
But I have no time to hear her out.<br/>
"Okay, let’s go." (Naofumi)<br/>
"Gaelion!" (Taniko)<br/>
And we approach the target.<br/>
"GYAOOOOOOO!" (Gaelion)<br/>
Gaelion shouts out.<br/>
Thump!<br/>
The Shield pulses in response to the yell.<br/>
W-what is this!?<br/>
When Gaelion shouted out earlier, nothing like this happened.<br/>
"This seems to be dangerous. We should create a bit more distance." (Rat)<br/>
"Gaelion! Come here! Please!" (Taniko)<br/>
But the shield continues to pulsate.<br/>
A visible black aura emanates from it and begins enveloping Gaelion.<br/>
And Gaelion even begins sucking up the pollution from the surrounding land.<br/>
Gaelion’s body gradually increases in size.<br/>
"I’m getting a very bad feeling, but Rat, do you know anything?" (NAofumi)<br/>
"How should I know? Isn’t it your shield’s fault?" (Rat)<br/>
"Probably… I think I absorbed some things like Firo did." (Naofumi)<br/>
"Hey, Naofumi. Why do you look a little happy?" (Melty)<br/>
"Ha?" (Naofumi)<br/>
Well, this did give off a bit of a ‘Boss Battle’ vibe.<br/>
… But I’m getting a very ominous feeling. Something must be wrong with me.<br/>
"Naofumi, You got power from the Zombie Dragon’s core, right?" (Melty)<br/>
"Yeah, the shield I used to defeat the Spirit Turtle, the Wrath Shield used the core’s power." (Naofumi)<br/>
"Didn’t that shield appear whenever you got mad at Sister and Father?" (Melty)<br/>
"Sister? Ah… Why was I angry at her again?" (Naofumi)<br/>
"THAAAAT’S IT!" (Melty and Sadina)<br/>
Melty and Sadina point their finger at me and shout out.<br/>
"Naofumi, that thing sucked up your hatred for Sister, among other things!" (Melty)<br/>
"W-what!?" (Naofumi)<br/>
Damn. I can’t remember anything.<br/>
I get the feeling that it’s something I’m better off forgetting. The world around me seems off.<br/>
Now that I think about it… Sadina is quite a beauty as well.<br/>
Why didn’t I notice it before?<br/>
"Naofumi, your eyes are creepy. Go back to your normal self." (Melty)<br/>
"Even if you tell me that~" (Naofumi)<br/>
Rafatalia. When I think of her, my heart beats faster.<br/>
Firo is in trouble. Even when shes a bird, she’s quite cute. In her human form, I might fall for her like Motoyasu.<br/>
Melty looks like a standard Tsundere, which is quite nice as well.<br/>
Atlas is also a blind cute girl. I can imagine her growing up to be a beauty. Fohl’s Sis-con is understandable.<br/>
Fufufu. If this was an Eroge, it would be NTR.<br/>
… This is realy bad! I don’t know what’s bad, though.<br/>
What’s this about NTR? Useless!<br/>
Is the me without Hate, Resentment, and Killing intent just a mass of Klesha?<br/>
I must retrieve my negativity fast, or things will get dangerous.<br/>
In numerous ways.<br/>
