Take Our Poll<br/>
Chapter 193: The 7 Deadly Sins<br/>
We found and searched the bandit’s hideout, but Ren was nowhere to be found.<br/>
He will probably take up a cowardly tactic such as dividing us and picking us off one at a time.<br/>
"Now then… What should we do?" (Naofumi)<br/>
"I never thought the Hero of the Sword would be the boss…" (Female Knight)<br/>
"I wish it weren’t so. He should have Witch backing him right now." (Naofumi)<br/>
"The former princess… There’s been an order issued to arrest her, but how long will she continue this idiotic cycle." (Female Knight)<br/>
We didn’t find any signs of Witch in the hideout either.<br/>
She may be waiting to ambush us somewhere.<br/>
"Hey, you." (Naofumi)<br/>
I approach the bandit that seems to be managing the place.<br/>
It’s quite a familiar face.<br/>
One that I’ve seen quite recently… Wait, isn’t he the one who was apprehended by Ren, and embezzled by me?<br/>
Why is he in a place like this?<br/>
"Oy… Didn’t you get captured?" (Naofumi)<br/>
These are the thieves that I always threaten with Firo.<br/>
It seems they’ve been left to manage this hideout.<br/>
They had an arrogant atmosphere around them, but as soon as they see me, they start shaking in their boots.<br/>
"Ah, this time we don’t have Firo with us." (Naofumi)<br/>
"S-shut up! I don’t care about that!" (Bandit)<br/>
"Instead, we have…" (Naofumi)<br/>
"KYUA!" (Gaelion)<br/>
And Gaelion steps forward in a fighting stance.<br/>
"Your opponent is this guy." (Naofumi)<br/>
"Wha!? He seems even more menacing than that man-eating bird!" (Bandit)<br/>
"I’ll leave that to your imagination." (Naofumi)<br/>
Well Dragons give off more of a man-eating vibe than Filo Rials.<br/>
I guess my arsenal is improving. The Bandits’ faces are blue.<br/>
I think I can easily draw out some info on Ren.<br/>
"Ha. Ha. Ha. Now then, Gaelion." (Naofumi)<br/>
"Kyua?" (Gaelion)<br/>
"Dinner is ser-" (Naofumi)<br/>
"We surrender!" (Bandit)<br/>
The bandit surrenders immediately.<br/>
Some of the people around him also have looks of resignation. The people who don’t know me are whispering among themselves.<br/>
"Hm? If you want to fight then come at me." (Naofumi)<br/>
I provoke them.<br/>
And some of the bandits lift their weapons and rush at me while yelling.<br/>
"KYUA!" (Gaelion)<br/>
"Earth Break!" (Taniko)<br/>
"Tei!" (Atlas)<br/>
"What is your relation with these bandits, Iwatani-dono?" (Female Knight)<br/>
"These people’s movements are too poor." (Rishia)<br/>
We have quite a few people with us, so it was extremely easy.<br/>
"W-what are these people!? Are they monsters!?" (Bandit)<br/>
"T-that’s right. This one is a monster stronger than that oppressive leader." (Bandit)<br/>
"Flattery will get you nowhere, now pay up." (Naofumi)<br/>
"Ku…" (Bandit)<br/>
"Anyways, why are you still running rampant after getting captured?" (Naofumi)<br/>
It’s weird that they got out so quickly.<br/>
They should be in this country’s equivalent of a prison.<br/>
"… The carriage we were transported in was attacked by robbers, and we escaped." (Bandit)<br/>
"I see…" (Naofumi)<br/>
What a messy reason.<br/>
So the carriage was attacked… That sounds really cliché.<br/>
This country’s security is surprisingly unreliable.<br/>
"With the help of the leader." (Bandit)<br/>
"Reeeeeeeen!" (Naofumi)<br/>
I unintentionally shout out.<br/>
So that idiot saved the bandits.<br/>
He released the bandits he apprehended himself.<br/>
"How long ago was that?" (Naofumi)<br/>
"Um… Around 2 weeks ago." (Bandit)<br/>
That means… Right after Witch invited him, he made a Bandit Organization.<br/>
That was around the time when Gaelion was born I think.<br/>
I met Witch when I was still carrying his egg.<br/>
"I see, then Ren… wait. Did your leader have a gaudy redheaded woman with him?" (Naofumi)<br/>
"Woman? The Leader was always alone." (Bandit)<br/>
Well, he did always act alone.<br/>
In a Net Game, he would be a so-called Solo Player.<br/>
It doesn’t appear that these Bandits are covering for her.<br/>
They really don’t know. They really haven’t seen her.<br/>
So Witch isn’t with Ren?<br/>
Now that I think about it, Ren’s equipment was quite rusted.<br/>
Assaulting adventurers seems to be quite profitable. But he hasn’t been able to sell and live off these and profits.<br/>
Is he earning money for the Witch?<br/>
Yeah, the treasures that the thieves have saved up is quite large.<br/>
Could the hidden leader have already been cast away?<br/>
… There are a lot of possibilities, but I can’t jump to any conclusions now.<br/>
He had a sword that seemed to be from the Curse Series.<br/>
From its skills and power, it’s definitely related.<br/>
But I don’t know what sort of curse it is.<br/>
Wrath… I think the series relates to the Seven Deadly Sins.<br/>
The skill he used was… Guillotine I think.<br/>
Like Blutofer, it summoned a torture or execution device. It had similarities, but the skill was clearly a different one.<br/>
If it’s a sin besides Wrath, it probably summons a different weapon.<br/>
I think the Sins were…<br/>
-Pride Envy, Wrath, Sloth, Greed, Gluttony, Lust.<br/>
I think.<br/>
For me, my hatred towards Witch, Trash and the people of this world awakened Wrath.<br/>
I don’t think Ren… awakened Sloth or Lust.<br/>
But all the others seem plausible.<br/>
I don’t think I will be able to identify it.<br/>
"Anyways, why did no one notice that the Bandit Leader was the Hero of the Sword?" (Naofumi)<br/>
"Most likely, no one would believe someone if they said it. The fact would merely remain as a rumor." (Bandit)<br/>
He did hide his face with a mask. If I didn’t see his Sword, I might not have recognized him myself.<br/>
If they haven’t heard his voice before, they wouldn’t have been able to identify him…<br/>
If he was so easily recognizable, he would have been captured as soon as he was found out as the cause of the Spirit Turtle Incident.<br/>
If everyone could recognize a hero, there would be a problem.<br/>
Is that why he began wearing a mask and asking as an adventurer?<br/>
Also, the lower soldiers of this country probably don’t know the whole truth.<br/>
The Queen and other country leaders agreed to make Melromark the only country without restrictions on the Heroes movements, in order to gather them in one place.<br/>
It seems that that this method successfully drew in Ren and Motoyasu. Hidden Justice is acting as a mercenary in Zeltburg.<br/>
However… The residents of this world believe rumors very easily.<br/>
They try to act on their own sense of justice, and cause trouble for those who are said to be evil.<br/>
But in this vast world, it is difficult to tell what is justice and what is vice.<br/>
Some may arbitrarily believe that the cause of their misfortunes are the heroes.<br/>
(TL: Thanks Obama)<br/>
But a ridiculous claim such as The Hero of the Sword being the Bandit Boss would never spread very far.<br/>
"Did none of the bandits here recognize the Hero of the Sword’s voice?" (Naofumi)<br/>
"He threatened to kill me if I told anyone else. He told me not to start a commotion." (Bandit)<br/>
Ah, so Ren also has a habit of concealing himself.<br/>
And that’s the reason for his mask.<br/>
"Honestly, I’m relieved. I can finally stop working here." (Bandit)<br/>
"I see." (Naofumi)<br/>
What exactly is Ren doing?<br/>
I think as I tie up the bandits and collect the spoils.<br/>
"I guess I should report to the Queen later." (Female Knight)<br/>
"Go do so. I think I have sufficient Authority to take these thieves’ belongings, and no matter what you report, it is of no concern to me." (Naofumi)<br/>
"*Sigh*…" (Female Knight)<br/>
Female Knight’s personality is troublesome.<br/>
Why must I make a compromise here?<br/>
These bandits have tried to swindle me and call me a fake. They’re a perfect example of the corruption that plagues this world.<br/>
"Really… Are all of the Heroes like this?" (Female Knight)<br/>
"No Idea, but don’t compare me with that guy." (Naofumi)<br/>
"I am under the impression that Iwatani-dono is the  most wicked of them all." (Female Knight)<br/>
"I’m more earnest than those guys that just do whatever they want." (Naofumi)<br/>
They’re always just living in a game. When things look bad for them, they’ll follow whoever offers them sweet words.<br/>
On the other hand, I distrust whoever tries to be kind to me.<br/>
Those people are the most suspicious.<br/>
It’s no concern to me whether or not they can get back up after their footholds are crushed.<br/>
"This world revolves on money." (Naofumi) (TL: Unlock the Shield of Greed)<br/>
"*Sigh*…" (Female Knight)<br/>
The Female Knight sighs deeply.<br/>
What is everyone else doing, anyways?<br/>
"KYUA!" (Gaelion)<br/>
"Gaelion! You can’t play with that!" (Taniko)<br/>
Child Gaelion is diving into the hoard of treasure.<br/>
Dragons are a race that loves treasure.<br/>
He seems delighted. Taniko is trying to calm him down.<br/>
Rishia is looking around with a very troubled expression. Atlas is facing me with a flirtatious pose.<br/>
"As expected of Naofumi-sama. Your ability to instantly annihilate the bandits is amazing." (Atlas)<br/>
"Really?" (Naofumi)<br/>
I left it to Atlas and the others, and didn’t really do anything, though…<br/>
Though I am treating them as a harvestable crop.<br/>
How should we bring these back? The current Gaelion will probably happily carry them.<br/>
"And so, Taniko. You were listening, right?" (Naofumi)<br/>
"… What of it?" (Taniko)<br/>
"Ha?" (Naofumi)<br/>
Taniko’s father’s enemy is hiding in the area, but she seems calm.<br/>
"The one who killed my father is definitely the Hero of the Sword. But I am not the type of person who would enthusiastically vie for revenge." (Taniko)<br/>
"I see. I thought it would motivate you." (Naofumi)<br/>
"… No." (Taniko)<br/>
Taniko tilts her head sideways.<br/>
"After being killed by the Sword Hero, Father never came home… So I don’t want to fight him. I don’t want to see him, and I want him to die in a ditch somewhere. But I have decided that I won’t involve myself with him." (Taniko)<br/>
"…I see…" (Naofumi)<br/>
Her resolve is good. This is the first time I respect Taniko.<br/>
I always hold grudges. I want to see the people I hate suffer.<br/>
When I act as such, Rafatalia and the others get angry, but that’s just my personality.<br/>
I know I’ll have to get over it sooner or later if I want to be happy.<br/>
I somehow feel like I’ve lost.<br/>
"…"<br/>
Gaelion quietly stares at Taniko.<br/>
"So, what does Iwatani-dono plan to do? I think that reporting to the country is the best option." (Female Knight)<br/>
"Let’s see… It is quite a pain, but if we let the Hero of the Sword do as he pleases, it will most likely affect my social status." (Naofumi)<br/>
I don’t want people coming to the conclusion that all the summoned heroes are villains.<br/>
I’ve finally gotten a force to oppose the wave. I don’t need this sort of trouble now.<br/>
… Yeah, the Hero of the Sword is a problem that we have to deal with.<br/>
I never thought he would commit crimes of his own accord.<br/>
He needs to feel the pressure of being pursued.<br/>
Like what I had to face during the time with that Second Princess assassination attempt.<br/>
He helped me during that pope incident, so I thought I would leave him be for now, but I never forget.<br/>
"In the end, my workload will just increase after this, right?" (Naofumi)<br/>
"R-right. The 7 star heroes will probably send you requests after this." (Female Knight)<br/>
"Then we better take care of this while we can." (Naofumi)<br/>
If it’s something I’ll have to do eventually, then there’s no helping it.<br/>
I’ll have to enhance the Wrath Shield.<br/>
Recently I’ve been having nothing but failures. My ingredients aren’t going to hold up.<br/>
"Atlas, can you sense Ren’s location?" (Naofumi)<br/>
She can sense something outside of human perception. She should be able to find him.<br/>
My Hate Reaction has a cooldown time, so I can’t use it consecutively .It’s range is large, but I don’t think I’ll be able to approach Ren so easily.<br/>
"Yes, I think I can, but… He has a teleporting power similar to Naofumi-sama, right?" (Atlas)<br/>
"… yeah." (Naofumi)<br/>
That’s right.<br/>
Even if Atlas manages to find him, if he finds himself at a disadvantage, then he’ll run away.<br/>
To capture him, we’ll have to take him out in one blow.<br/>
He’s a hero that has something like the Curse Series. This will be difficult.<br/>
"GYAU!" (Gaelion)<br/>
Gaelion runs at me and puts me on his back.<br/>
He puts his head near my ear.<br/>
"I have an idea. Will you not leave it to me?" (Gaelion)<br/>
He speaks in a small voice so Taniko doesn’t hear.<br/>
"Do you have a reason?" (Naofumi)<br/>
"Yeah, I have a desire to broil his entrails, so I would like to have a rematch with him." (Gaelion)<br/>
"Understood." (Naofumi)<br/>
And in whispers, we discuss a plan.<br/>
"I’m putting Gaelion in charge of drawing him out. Everyone else is on standby until he gives the signal." (Naofumi)<br/>
"What are you deciding by yourself!?" (Taniko)<br/>
Taniko raises an objection. Well, it’s her beloved dragon. I guess she doesn’t want him to face the same fate as her father.<br/>
Rishia… is as nervous as always.<br/>
It’s as if she hasn’t grown as all.<br/>
"Can we leave it to you?" (Female Knight)<br/>
Female Knight looks troubled.<br/>
"GYAU!" (Gaelion)<br/>
Gaelion makes a confident pose.<br/>
However, Gaelion.<br/>
Remember this. Child Gaelion says Kyua.<br/>
"Rishia, go with Taniko and keep watch outside." (Naofumi)<br/>
"Listen to me!" (Taniko)<br/>
"Gaelion says he wants to do it." (Naofumi)<br/>
"GYAU!" (Gaelion)<br/>
"Gaelion can’t do it!" (Taniko)<br/>
"GYAUGYAU!" (Gaelion)<br/>
Gaelion makes several gestures in protest.<br/>
If only he would speak…<br/>
"KYUA!" (Gaelion)<br/>
He returns his mind to the child one.<br/>
This one gestures as well.<br/>
It seems both dragons want to duke it out with the Sword.<br/>
"Mu… I don’t care anymore!" (Taniko)<br/>
Taniko pouts and walks off.<br/>
Rishia rushes after her.<br/>
"Now then, Wyndia is away." (Gaelion)<br/>
"It Spoke-!?" (Female Knight)<br/>
Female Knight jumps back in surprise.<br/>
Ah, she didn’t know.<br/>
I never told anyone, so the people who know that he can speak are quite few.<br/>
"Let me introduce myself once more. My name is Gaelion. I am the Dragon Emperor Fragment that acted as Wyndia’s father." (Gaelion)<br/>
Female Knight points at Gaelion.<br/>
"I have a grudge against the Sword Hero, so I want to be the one to lure him out. Also, I have an idea." (Gaelion)<br/>
"What sort of idea?" (Naofumi)<br/>
"I haven’t tested if it was possible yet… and the time between shots is quite long, but…" (Gaelion)<br/>
Gaelion begins explaining his idea to us.<br/>
"I see… That might work well. I’ll leave it to you." (Naofumi)<br/>
"Much appreciated." (Gaelion)<br/>
"Somehow… I was surprised with Firo-dono, but it seems that strange monsters do gather around you, Iwatani-dono." (Female Knight)<br/>
Female knight scratches her head as she speaks.<br/>
Why does she seem so amazed?<br/>
With that attitude, you won’t survive in that village.<br/>
Everyone there grows quite weirdly.<br/>
"Fufufu… I’ll let that brat taste the true terror of the reincarnated me." (Gaelion)<br/>
"Watch out for his surprise attacks from his concealed state." (Naofumi)<br/>
"Who the hell do you think I am? I’ll never let such low class attacks effect me." (Gaelion)<br/>
His concealment skill isn’t that high in level.<br/>
My Hate Reaction is unable to lift the current Rafatalia’s  invisibility magic.<br/>
Gaelion’ll probably notice him.<br/>
Though I didn’t notice him, and took a critical to the back.<br/>
Without the Shield’s protection, I am but an ordinary person.<br/>
I don’t know exactly how it works, but I’m merely using its power.<br/>
I can’t call this power my own.<br/>
The only thing I can really brag about since coming to this world is my knowledge of the language.<br/>
But that’s common sense to a large part of the population, so it’s nothing special.<br/>
To draw the Hero of the sword out, Gaelion became the bait.<br/>
