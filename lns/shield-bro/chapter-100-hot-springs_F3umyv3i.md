There are bound to be a few lines that I probably didn't translate correctly or didn't phrase correctly. If so point it out and I'll try to fix it. If you see a * on a line, it means I wasn't completely sure about the sentence and if you can correct it if you think of something better. <br/>

Chapter 100: Hot Spring <br/>
 <br/>
After that, Since we lightly played at the sandy beach while the day waned we returned to the inn, then I looked for the shadow to ask about the schedule. <br/>
 <br/>
Naofumi: "That reminds me, what time is the meeting?" <br/>
Shadow: "After Heroes bathing and meal degojaru." <br/>
Naofumi: "I see. " <br/>
 <br/>
So after a bath and dinner is the meeting huh, and how much information I can draw out from those guys, everything is hanging on me. <br/>
Before that...... <br/>
 <br/>
Naofumi: "Then I'll go to the bath.." <br/>
Raphtalia: "Aa, Yes. We'll also take a bath shortly." <br/>
Naofumi: "Aah. " <br/>
 <br/>
So, leaving those two behind, I went to enter the bath.  <br/>
 <br/>
Naofumi: "Fuuu..." <br/>
 <br/>
Soaked in a Japanese style hot spring of open air, I let out a sigh while looking to the sky.  <br/>
*Since it's also a hot spring, lately it's good and refreshing entering the bath everyday. <br/>
Feels like my body's sluggishness is considerably improving too. <br/>
Though I've yet to recover from my status. <br/>
Or maybe despite my body being sluggish, I'm getting accustomed to it. <br/>
So, I had entered the bath with that good feeling but. <br/>
 <br/>
Motoyasu: "Oh? Well if it isn't Naofumi." <br/>
 <br/>
Motoyasu enters the bathroom.  <br/>
Where is the spear? <br/>
After saying that, If I look well enough, there is a really small spear attacked to his waist. <br/>
Figured it was like that. <br/>
I too had reduced the shield as much as possible and placed it on my back.  <br/>
Since I'm not able to remove it from the body, it helps to be able to change where it's attached. <br/>
After pouring hot water on himself, Motoyasu enters hot spring bath.  <br/>
 <br/>
Naofumi: "You already fine after that hangover?" <br/>
Motoyasu: "Can YOU talk?" <br/>
Naofumi: "You ate that yourself right? I didn't tell you to eat it." <br/>
Naofumi: "Well, seems like your world is a different Japan, with a different constitution. " <br/>
Motoyasu: "Yea Yea." <br/>
 <br/>
Well, not like I was drunk though. <br/>
To begin with, I'm sure you had fun being nursed by the bitches. <br/>
Though you might have not realized it with a hangover and all. <br/>
 <br/>
Motoyasu: "Heeey. It's quite a good bath ya know." <br/>
 <br/>
Motoyasu raises a loud voice toward someone.  <br/>
Who's he talking to? <br/>
 <br/>
Itsuki: "I can see that myself. How many times do you think we've come here?" <br/>
 <br/>
Itsuki and his male followers had entered. <br/>
Thus, seeing Motoyasu, Itsuki makes a turbid expression. <br/>
 <br/>
Itsuki: "Because I have a lot of things I want to say to you in the meeting, Please keep it in moderation." <br/>
Motoyasu: "Those are my words but it's an hot spring you know? You gotta enjoy it." <br/>
 <br/>
What are you enjoying? <br/>
Was what I was thinking but then I noticed Ren was among the group as well. <br/>
Well, today's the meeting after all. <br/>
Something like this happens too. <br/>
 <br/>
Firo: "Master-" <br/>
 <br/>
Jumping over the fence, Firo comes to the mens bath. <br/>
Of course, in her demon appearance.  <br/>
 <br/>
Naofumi: "Hm? Something wrong?" <br/>
Firo: "I want to enter with Master. " <br/>
Naofumi: "You are a bird. Enter a different hot bath. Actually, rather than a normal bath, go to a bird bath." <br/>
Firo: "Noo" <br/>
 <br/>
Such a selfish fellow.  <br/>
Well...... <br/>
 <br/>
Naofumi: "Get rid of any loose feathers." <br/>
Firo: "Yay" <br/>
 <br/>
Firo soaks in the bath next to me. <br/>
 <br/>
Motoyasu: "Bathing together with Firo-chan." <br/>
 <br/>
Motoyasu approaches here with some disgusting eyes.  <br/>
Firo backed off and used me as a shield. <br/>
 <br/>
Motoyasu: "Firo-chan. Your angel form if you will." <br/>
Firo: "No!" <br/>
 <br/>
This guy is persistent. <br/>
How much can a guy like angels? <br/>
To begin with, is bathing together with a bird so much fun? <br/>
I don't understand.  <br/>
Motoyasu starts bathing in high spirits. <br/>
 <br/>
Motoyasu: "With that, We all did the party exchange so, who do you guys think is the most beautiful girl?" <br/>
 <br/>
Uwaa... He though of an awfully stupid topic. <br/>
This isn't a school trip. <br/>
No, Maybe for Motoyasu it's like a school trip from his world? <br/>
Ren and Itsuki are making questionable faces too. <br/>
But, maybe he thought this out for the sake of making conversation with Itsuki. <br/>
 <br/>
Motoyasu: "Next, have you guys already done it? I... heheh." <br/>
 <br/>
Motoyasu is endlessly annoying. <br/>
What does this guy want to do. <br/>
Rather, that statement reeks of a virgin. <br/>
Was this guy really a ladies man? <br/>
This is a tremendously unpleasant mood. <br/>
I just entered, but should I leave? <br/>
 <br/>
Motoyasu: "Hey, Naofumi, you've already done Raphtalia right?" <br/>
Naofumi: "Why are you turning the conversation my way?" <br/>
 <br/>
This guy, to talk as if there was nothing between us. <br/>
Rather, who was it that was glaring at me as if I was their parents enemy when it was the incident with the queen. <br/>
Is this light mood something a hero needs? <br/>
Can't be. <br/>
 <br/>
Motoyasu: "Isn't it fine. This time's festivities is for the sake of growing friendships right?" <br/>
Naofumi: "What are you misunderstanding?" <br/>
 <br/>
Well, The official stance may be like that, but truth is, it's for drawing out information. <br/>
No... If it's Motoyasu, It's likely friendship. <br/>
Though I'm sure it's less friendship than snatching women to him. <br/>
Ren and Itsuki have memories I'm sure. <br/>
Excessively unpleasant expressions shoot toward Motoyasu. <br/>
 <br/>
Motoyasu: "Anyway, I'll tell ya my particular cute girl rankings." <br/>
Naofumi: "I refuse." <br/>
Itsuki: "Unproductive." <br/>
Ren: "Not my hobby." <br/>
 <br/>
While saying that, Ren and Itsuki couldn't silence Motoyasu. <br/>
Just listening is useless. <br/>
 <br/>
Motoyasu: "My type of girl is Whore, Raphatalia-chan, Firo-chan, and Rishia-chan." <br/>
Naofumi: "......" <br/>
 <br/>
What the hell is Motoyasu's taste. <br/>
All members and types scattered all over. <br/>
It's fine as long as the face is good? <br/>
 <br/>
Itsuki: "That's so isn't it. Whore is a former princess after all. It seems her personality is bad, but I was normally interacting with her during my time." <br/>
 <br/>
And here Itsuki is joining into the conversation. <br/>
Armor is.... muttering something to Itsuki's ear. <br/>
I can slightly hear it. <br/>
*Something like talking to Itsuki about their own taste or so. <br/>
Every last one of them is going with the flow. <br/>
 <br/>
Ren: "Well, you say the Queen's personality is bad, But I don't mind it." <br/>
 <br/>
Then, Ren jumped in too. <br/>
You... Didn't you say this wasn't your hobby? <br/>
 <br/>
Ren: "Rather, Raphtalia-san personality is severe right? Or perhaps damn serious. she's hardheaded. But her face looks is very put in order." <br/>
Motoyasu: "Right?" <br/>
Itsuki: "...Certainly, her face is good. Though her personality is bad." <br/>
 <br/>
Again, why are you guys getting swallowed into Motoyasu's pace. <br/>
It's easy to spit out a complaint, but I don't want to play along with them. <br/>
Or rather, It's not that her personality is bad, You guys handled Raphtalia wrong. <br/>
 <br/>
Firo: "Is Firo cute?" <br/>
 <br/>
Firo asks me of all things in the world.  <br/>
 <br/>
Naofumi: "Who knows."  <br/>
Firo: "Buuu....." <br/>
Motoyasu: "In my heart Firo-chan is the cutest! So turn into your angel appearance." <br/>
Firo: "No!" <br/>
 <br/>
Motoyasu, is her human form really getting to you that much? <br/>
Even though if you raise a Philorial yourself, It'll become similar to Firo.  <br/>
 <br/>
Motoyasu: "Rishia-chan has some praiseworthy cuteness too... I'm jealous of you Itsuki." <br/>
Itsuki: "No... that girl is...... " <br/>
 <br/>
Itsuki, somehow seems to be getting embarrassed. <br/>
The guy who will do anything for the sake of being an ally of justice. <br/>
*Doubt grows in me too about how Rishia became a party member of Itsuki's, with how he likes to stir up trouble just to get the fame for solving it and all. <br/>
 <br/>
Ren: "Was there such a person?" <br/>
 <br/>
Seems like she was outside Ren's view huh. <br/>
Well, I can't negate the possibility of Itsuki's party moving on his basis......They may have feigned friendliness with Ren and Motoyasu. <br/>
In the first place, Rishia's weak good luck, or rather, she's not very self-assertive herself.  <br/>
If you look at it from Ren's side, there were only plain people. <br/>
 <br/>
Motoyasu: *"Seems like everyone and me has the same realization." <br/>
Itsuki: "Well, in general that's right. If it's just the face." <br/>
Ren: "......" <br/>
 <br/>
Ren and I ignore in silence <br/>
Rather, what's with this conversation. <br/>
No, probably something between men. <br/>
 <br/>
Firo: "Firo's going back to Oneechan now. "  <br/>
Naofumi: "Aah, Just go." <br/>
Firo: "Yea!" <br/>
 <br/>
And, the cheerfully nodding Firo jumped over the fence and returned to the woman's bath. <br/>
Now, guess I'll leave. <br/>
Somehow, it feels like Motoyasu is in high tension, and wants to open up a conversation with just men. <br/>
 <br/>
Motoyasu: "Hey, Naofumi, How far have you gone with Raphtalia-chan?" <br/>
Naofumi: "That again, As I said before, we don't have that kind of relationship." <br/>
Motoyasu: "Well, Surely Raphtalia thinks differently." <br/>
Naofumi:"What are you joking about..." <br/>
Motoyasu:"Then, was there no kind of action?" <br/>
Naofumi: "None." <br/>
Motoyasu: "Well, Then maybe Raphtalia approached you or so? <br/>
Naofumi: "No Approaching or anything. In the first place, she's a kid." <br/>
Motoyasu: "Are you dense? Then Raphtalia hasn't undressed or anything? I can't tell with the clothes and armor but her proportion is good right?" <br/>
 <br/>
Seems like I gotta keep him company for us to move on. <br/>
He really is a troublesome guy. <br/>
 <br/>
Naofumi: "Come to think of it, Before..." <br/>
 <br/>
An event at the time I was peddling. <br/>
It was a time when we went to a famous region with hotsprings all over to sell things. <br/>
The inn I entered likewise had a hot spring. <br/>
 <br/>
Raphtalia: "Naofumi-sama......" <br/>
 <br/>
*The evening of that day, Raphtalia, who was wearing a bathrobe, entered the room and talked to me while I was in the middle of compounding. <br/>
Somehow, in an appearance only of wrapped in a towel, I remember her seeming embarrassed to me. <br/>
Not knowing what she was thinking, Raphtalia undid the large cloth and displayed her own body. <br/>
 <br/>
Raphtalia: "H, how is it?" <br/>
 <br/>
She acquired muscles to an extent, I know her breast were big too, from that time she hugged before, I thought they would become a hindrance. <br/>
How should I say, They are plump, I thought where did all that power come from. <br/>
Her hair was wet too. <br/>
Thought there were some scars on her back , now there's no trace of them left. <br/>
Because the time I got her to show me them before, since I had effective medicine for scars I smeared it on them.. <br/>
Raphtalia was showing me its whole body shamefully.  <br/>
 <br/>
Naofumi: "Well, It's gotten considerably better right? There's a huge difference between now and the time we met." <br/>
Raphtalia: "Eh? Um...... is it just that?" <br/>
Naofumi: "Is there something else?" <br/>
 <br/>
To my question, somehow Raphtalia had her mouth opened wide as if she was astonished and at a lost for words. <br/>
 <br/>
Naofumi: "Also, you'll catch a cold if you stay naked like...." <br/>
Firo: "Ah! Oneechan got naked!" <br/>
 <br/>
Firo returned to the room and raised a fuss. <br/>
Thus took off her one piece, got completely naked and charged here. <br/>
 <br/>
*Firo: "Let Firo mix in too!" <br/>
*Raphtalia: *"We aren't mixing! What is that?" <br/>
 <br/>
*Normally, from the standpoint of the naked Firo, She was eager to get naked. <br/>
 <br/>
Naofumi: "And that's what happened. " <br/>
Motoyasu: "This dense motherfucker------!" <br/>
 <br/>
Motoyasu with a look of some anger, came swinging his fist at me. <br/>
I stopped and gripped that fist. <br/>
 <br/>
Naofumi: "What's with you so suddenly." <br/>
Motoyasu: "That was a open appeal! To not chow down on a meal set before you is rude!" <br/>
Naofumi: "What are you saying. I said it before didn't I? Raphtalia's a kid. And also 'damn serious', she wouldn't be thinking of such a thing." <br/>
 <br/>
Try having a relationship poorly, and when it comes time to fight waves she's pregnant and not covered as war potential. <br/>
Among other such things. <br/>
Raphtalia who gets fired up for a mission wouldn't desire such a thing. <br/>
Rather, I'm sure she'd hate it. <br/>
I view creating an environment for Raphtalia to fight easily as my motto.  <br/>
 <br/>
Motoyasu: "That level of denseness, I can't believe it." <br/>
 <br/>
Motoyasu, seems like he willfully consents and backs off. <br/>
After that, Motoyasu instantaneously switches over, this time shifting his focus on the fence. <br/>
 <br/>
Motoyasu: "If we are men, then the obligatory pe-ek-ing, is our responsibility as Heroes!" <br/>
Naofumi:"How is that responsibility!" <br/>
Motoyasu: "Look, you guys are interested too right?" <br/>
 <br/>
And here, Justice dumbass Itsuki isn't keeping silent. <br/>
 <br/>
Itsuki: "You mustn't do such a thing!" <br/>
 <br/>
And while saying such things, Itsuki doesn't stop Motoyasu very much, instead he gets closer. <br/>
You too huh. <br/>
Armor and other men are interested too and are gathering around the fence. <br/>
Hey Queen. <br/>
Seems like Friendships are deepening in a difference meaning. <br/>
 <br/>
Ren: "Stupid." <br/>
 <br/>
While Ren grumbles such, he doesn't try to get out the bath. <br/>
I don't want to go along with these guys anymore. <br/>
 <br/>
Naofumi: "Bath in moderation." <br/>
 <br/>
Because I'm quite feed up I leave the bath. <br/>
 <br/>
Motoyasu: "What Naofumi, you aren't joining in?" <br/>
Naofumi: "I said it before, I have no interest." <br/>
 <br/>
To insist on what seeing the body of a real woman. <br/>
Even under normal circumstances, I recall bitch and become instantly unhappy. <br/>
In the first place, if I impudently stay in this place, I might be charged with an unjustified crime again. <br/>
They say a wise man keeps away from danger. <br/>
So if even Shadow and me are talking in the room safely, when something happens, I would have an alibi. <br/>
 <br/>
Motoyasu: "Seriously dense. I understand Raphtalia-chan's hardships." <br/>
Naofumi: "Whatever." <br/>
 <br/>
Maybe the Raphtalia in your head is in love with me, wants a relationship and is merely waiting for a chance to strike, but reality's different. <br/>
She only has respect towards me as a hero. <br/>
From such a Raphtalia  it'll become a betrayal of expectations. <br/>
Sheesh.... they say great men have great fondness for the sensual pleasures, but how about loving it too much. <br/>
Motoyasu will surely, after the waves are over, have various experiences with women. <br/>
The party by the Bitch for the Bitch is on the verge of collapse.  <br/>
 <br/>
Naofumi: "Fuu." <br/>
 <br/>
After the bath, I cool myself off in the room. <br/>
Up until just now, Shadow and I had some idle chat, but they said some kind of report came in and vanished. <br/>
Before long, I could hear the sound of footsteps and Raphtalia in a towel came rushing in. <br/>
 <br/>
Raphtalia: "Naofumi-sama!" <br/>
Naofumi: "What? Were Motoyasu and them found peeping?" <br/>
Raphtalia: "Aa, Yes! Just now, the other heroes are reflecting." <br/>
 <br/>
Sheesh...... Well, It was the Shadow's observations after all. <br/>
*Though this says as friendship is deepened, becomes silent, and is so.  <br/>
Now that I think about it, what is the standard of peeping in this world? <br/>
The norm in my world is around Edo Period or so there appeared to be holes for peeping use in the bath. <br/>
Here the men's bath and such had been separated but comparatively in different inns in the region there was mixed bathing. <br/>
 <br/>
Raphtalia: "Not that! Naofumi-sama was?" <br/>
Naofumi: "Why do I need to peep?" <br/>
 <br/>
Raphtalia drops her head crestfallenly to my answer.  <br/>
 <br/>
Raphtalia: "...I thought talking with the other heroes would have awoken something in you a little.. " <br/>
Naofumi: "Awoken?" <br/>
 <br/>
A different power or the shield's true strength maybe? <br/>
I want to awaken that. <br/>
Unfortunately, nothing.  <br/>
 <br/>
Firo: "What's wrong with oneechan?" <br/>
 <br/>
Firo who came back, tilted her head to Raphtalia who head was dropping. <br/>
 <br/>
Naofumi: "Who knows." <br/>
 <br/>
What made Raphtalia get so depressed? <br/>
 <br/>
Naofumi: "What's got you depressed? Did being seen naked by Motoyasu put you into shock?" <br/>
Raphtalia: "I wasn't seen!" <br/>
Naofumi: "Then that's good. " <br/>
Raphtalia: "Haaaa, whatever.. " <br/>
 <br/>
Raphtalia returned with a weary look  after just stepping out of the bath. <br/>
By the way, after retuning I asked for the reason but, I didn't get a reply.
