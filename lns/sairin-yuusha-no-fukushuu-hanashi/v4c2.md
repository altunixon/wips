Beyond the border within the Empire and the Religious State, there is a large mountain soar ahead. It is called Palum sacred mountain and it is the dangerous place where demonic being incident occurs naturally.<br/>
Beyond that Palum sacred mountain is the holy city of Schmelz.<br/>
It is said to be related to the “Holy Light God” and it is one of the most important holy city of the Religious State.<br/>
――In a small village in the vicinity of the holy city, there is an orphanage where the two of my revenge targets live.<br/>
We have decided the holy city of Schmelz as our destination for the time being.<br/>
I wanted to go to see what kind of life of my vengeance target are having right now at once, but there are necessary preparations I need to take first.<br/>
The maintenance of equipment and information gathering about the orphanage.<br/>
In addition, the fifth demon lord labyrinth that exists in the Religious State――I have made preparation about “Mourning Light labyrinth”.<br/>
That’s why we were climbing Palm holy mountain to head for Schmelz first.<br/>
I’m used to climbing experience, but climbing this mountain is a bit of a chore.<br/>
The foothold is bad and the ground surface is hollowed.<br/>
The trees and flowers are strangely large and visibility is bad due to the miasma that naturally breaks out from sacred mountain.<br/>
In addition,<br/>
「……Three from the front」(Elfi)<br/>
「Got it」(Iori)<br/>
We often encounter the demonic being because of the influence of the miasma.<br/>
As for appearing frequently is the “Tail Spear Monkey” that a tail is sharp like a spear and the “Monster Tree Trent” that mimicking trees and shrubs.<br/>

「It is the “Monster Tree Treant” ahead. Eei, one after another! Iori, enemies!」(Elfi)<br/>
「……Aa!」(Iori)<br/>
The demonic being appears frequently when we barely walked just several steps from the one before.<br/>
This mountain seems to have a connection with the “Fallen Light God” and perhaps that has influenced all of this.<br/>

Report this ad「If I am still the demon king, I would have subjected these demonic beings」(Elfi)<br/>
Elfi looked at the remains of the defeated demonic being while muttering so resentfully.<br/>
A demon king, is it not?<br/>
Come to think of it, Elfi had the “Demon King Crest” which is a proof of the demon king.<br/>
「Did the demonic being follow the Mazoku with the Demon King Crest or those who were recognised by it?」(Iori)<br/>
「Ah, yeah. That’s how it’s work」(Elfi)<br/>
「Base on what kind of principle?」(Iori)<br/>
「Hmm……I don’t quite get it though」(Elfi)<br/>
「Then, don’t say it while looking that proud」(Iori)<br/>
……This fellow is useless.<br/>
「Elfi, you still have the Demon king crest on your body, don’t you? It’s not the demonic being of the labyrinth which obedient to the demon king, but are the demonic being that born naturally from the miasma will be able to obey too?」(Iori)<br/>

“Did such kind of possibility existed!?” I can easily read that she having such thought from her expression.<br/>
No way! By any chance did she have not tried it before?<br/>
「Hm……hmm. I will praise you for such idea, Iori」(Elfi)<br/>

「D, don’t look me with such eyes!」(Elfi)<br/>
This fellow……<br/>
「……Well, can you do it now?」(Iori)<br/>
「Who do you think I am?」(Elfi)<br/>
As Elfi laughs conceitedly.<br/>
Just in time, there are three tail lance monkeys approaching before us.<br/>
Hence, Elfi went out to the front of the demonic being while brimmed with confidence.<br/>
「I command thee under the name of Elfisuzaku Gildegaldo!!」(Elfi)<br/>
Elfi shouted with full of spirit voice that echoes throughout the mountains.<br/>
Her dignified air is transmitted to me who was watching from behind.<br/>
Perhaps, this might really work.<br/>
「――Obey Me!!」(Elfi)<br/>
Therefore, Elfi ordered the tail spear monkey with her perfect dignify gesture. With the vigour that worthy of the former demon king, meanwhile, the tail spear Monkeys is――<br/>
『GIAaaAAAA!』<br/>
「UWaAA, Iori! It was worthless!」(Elfi)<br/>
They thrust their spears simultaneously at Elfi that make she acrobatically dodging those spear while<br/>
having complicated facial expression.<br/>

I was asked about such a thing by Elfi who is directing her gaze on my stew.<br/>
I remember the feeling of battle and shook my head.<br/>
「……Not really. Even though I used three Labyrinth Core, only less than half of the magical power from the heyday has return」(Iori)<br/>
For the current me, I was able to use the “Magic Break Suppression” or “Magic Usurpation” with my currently magical power after having to adjust it a few time. For the present time, it became possible for me to use enough magical power without using the magic stone.<br/>
However, it is still far from the heyday.<br/>
It seems better to think about the possibility that the original power will not return even if you use all of the labyrinth core<br/>

I tried it a couple of times, but I could activate it only for a moment.<br/>
It was lucky enough if that happens because sometimes it does not even activate at all.<br/>
「I can’t say anything because I can’t use the mental magic myself……」(Elfi)<br/>
Elfi put her hand on her mouth and groaning as she pondering about something.<br/>

Report this adNone of those demonic being that I fought was an opponent that acquire me to use the mental magic.<br/>
It is only small fry that does not compare with Dionis, and it might be activated against the opponents who I cannot win by my base power alone.<br/>
「I understood, let’s do that」(Iori)<br/>
 <br/>
◆<br/>
 <br/>
――due to the raging wind, the barrier is begun to creak.<br/>
I barely parry the soundless approaching wind with the jade longsword.<br/>
That’s right――the opponent that I’m dealing with is like the wind itself.<br/>
When you about to perceive its presence, it is already pass through.<br/>
「――”Demon leg・Windless Flash”――」(Elfi)<br/>
One of the innate abilities of the third part the『Both legs』 that Elfi regained.<br/>
It is an instantaneous force that moves at a speed like the blowing wind.<br/>
But the threat is not just that speed, with exceptional skill, Elfi comes close to me in “silence”.<br/>
「……Again, it is outrageous」(Iori)<br/>
While moving with the “Demon leg”, Elfi hammering me with the “Demon arm”.<br/>
It is possible to respond to it and it is thanks to the knowledge that I acquired during those heroic eras.<br/>
By using the “soft sword”, I elude the overwhelming power to the ground.<br/>
「What’s the matter, Iori? The one that you used on that Ogre, aren’t you going to use that “Ogre Sword”?」(Elfi)<br/>
「To use that, neither my muscle power nor magical power is good enough to use it!」(Iori)<br/>
I eluded Elfi pursuit while answering her question.<br/>
The “Ogre sword” is a sword skill that created by Dionis. Because it is made to consume an exclusively enormous amount of magical power and muscular strength that he has which surpassing the humans, neither of them can be used by the present me who is weakened.<br/>
「――”Demon arm・Rupture Break”」(Elfi)<br/>
「!?」(Iori)<br/>
I evade the five claws which swung down at me by back step.<br/>
But,<br/>
「Kuh……」(Iori)<br/>
A single blow of Elfi greatly scooped out the ground and my footing has been snatch that causes my posture greatly broken.<br/>
「――”Demon eye”」(Elfi)<br/>
「――――!」(Iori)<br/>
――at the back.<br/>
The time I perceived Elfi, she was already in my rear.<br/>
In the dark night, a pair of crimson eyes is glittering.<br/>
With this position, I won’t be able to dodge it. Both of the “Magic Ursupation” and “Magic Suppression” will not be in time.<br/>
I was able to sense it from Elfi as I can felt stung on my skin due to the magical power alone.<br/>
I won’t be able to prevent it with this equipment alone.<br/>
I could see Elfi has loosened her cheeks in the wind as if she was convinced of her victory.<br/>
「――”Complete Destruction Explosion”」(Elfi)<br/>
Hence, the flaming crimson destruction light is approaching me.<br/>
This idiot, can’t you holding back a bit.<br/>
Oh crap, I won’t get away with just a scratch if I take the hit directly.<br/>

I set up my luggage and departed.<br/>
We were attacked several times on the way by a demonic being, but we have repulse it lightly.<br/>
「It was a lot of horrors even when it was only a severed head, but when the arm and the foot were added, it became extra eerie. Honestly, it was sickening」(Iori)<br/>

It seems that it will be a frightful scene to watch bodiless creature.<br/>
We advancing onward while sandwiching the break for several times during those several hours.<br/>
Finally, we arrived at the summit of the holy mountain.<br/>
A small town is visible not far from here.<br/>
「Oh, so that is the holy city of Schmelz」(Elfi)<br/>
「Aa, it seems in terms of distance, we will be able to arrive at it tomorrow」(Iori)<br/>
Here is the turning point.<br/>
It will become easy physically since we were going to descend the mountain.<br/>
Without having trouble to lose our way, it should not take a long time.<br/>
「Let descend the mountain as much as possible before the sunset」(Iori)<br/>
Saying so, it was when I was going to go down from the top of the mountain.<br/>

「……Obstruction Barrier」(Iori)<br/>
 <br/>
Due to this barrier, I do not know where they are attacking from.<br/>
However, there was something that I’m curious regarding this barrier.<br/>
That is.<br/>
「 This barrier is……the Kingdom……technique」(Iori)<br/>
The magician who can exercise this is quite limited in the kingdom.<br/>
Hence, I understood who set it shortly.<br/>
A pursuer from the kingdom, the “Selector”.<br/>
And probably the one who leads them――<br/>
「……Luser!」(Iori)<br/>
Thus, the magic attack is being downpoured from the outside the barrier.<br/>
