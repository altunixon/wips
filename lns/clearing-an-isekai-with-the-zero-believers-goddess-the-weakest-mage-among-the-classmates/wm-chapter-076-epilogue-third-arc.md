<br/>
-Christiana POV-<br/>
"Takatsuki-sama really is an incredible person. It is just as Danna-sama said!" (Nina)<br/>
Nina’s ears shook up and down.<br/>
"Oh my, Nina. Are you not going to get happy at the fact that Fujiwara-sama became a noble?" (Chris)<br/>
Even this light talk would have gotten the mood thorny if it had been in the past.<br/>
"Ah! Sorry, Danna-sama!" (Nina)<br/>
"No no, I am also proud of him-desu zo. To think my friend would be chosen as a hero. Makkaren has become a city where a Hero is living in it, and it will grow even more, Chris-dono." (Fujiwara)<br/>
"Yeah, that’s exactly right." (Chris)<br/>
The effect that the title of Hero has is big.<br/>
Especially with the rumors that the legendary Great Demon Lord is reviving. The people are living their lives with worries.<br/>
The people made slaves by the demons, the Dark Era.<br/>
It is being rumored that this era will also be coming back.<br/>
In the public, there’s also rumors about strange heretics who are not in the religion of the Goddesses, and the drug that softens the fear called Weed spreading more widely.<br/>
Everyone is scared.<br/>
Because of that, a city where a Hero is in would be a priced land where everyone would want to live in.<br/>
That’s the pattern for the capitals of the various countries.<br/>
Also, the cities where a Hero is in are all big cities.<br/>
(Makkaren will be a city where a Hero lives in…) (Chris)<br/>
It will get busy, Chris-dono." (Fujiwara)<br/>
"Yeah, you are right." (Chris)<br/>
Fujiwara-sama speaks to me as if he had read my mind.<br/>
Makkaren will most likely have a whole lot of skilled people coming.<br/>
This is the chance for Makkaren to become big!<br/>
"You look like you are in joy there, Chris." (Nina)<br/>
"You will also be busy, so steel yourself, okay?" (Chris)<br/>
Nina and I laughed.<br/>
"Ah! Makoto has returned." "Takatsuki-kun, how was it?" <br/>
I heard the voice of Lucy-san and Sasaki-san.<br/>
Looks like the so talked about Hero-sama has returned.<br/>
"Nothing, we simply had a casual talk." (Makoto)<br/>
Takatsuki-sama, who just recently became the country designated hero, scratched his cheek.<br/>
(He doesn’t look strong though…) (Chris)<br/>
But he has fought against those fearsome Taboo Monsters twice and won.<br/>
The people that came from a parallel world are all amazing.<br/>
"What did you talk about?" (Aya)<br/>
"Uhm, things like, ‘I will work hard as a Hero from now on’. Also, Princess Sofia made tea for me." (Makoto)<br/>
"Hmm, sounds normal." (Aya)<br/>
"Right?" (Makoto)<br/>
(Eh?) (Chris)<br/>
Hearing this, I stiffened.<br/>
"Takatsuki-sama! Princess Sofia poured tea for you herself?!" (Chris)<br/>
"Y-Yeah, that’s right. Is there a problem with that?" (Makoto)<br/>
"Isn’t it because it is rude to make a Princess do that?" (Lucy)<br/>
"Even if you tell me that…" (Makoto)<br/>
"No, that’s not it, Lucy-san. That’s not what I meant…" (Chris)<br/>
Even when I looked around, I was the only one who seemed surprised.<br/>
"Chris-dono?" "Chris, what’s the matter?" <br/>
Fujiwara-sama and Nina were wondering what’s happening.<br/>
"N-No, it is nothing. I was simply a bit surprised…" (Chris)<br/>
Yeah, it might just be me jumping to conclusions.<br/>
It should be better if I don’t say anything rash.<br/>
—A woman of Rozes inviting a man to their own room and serving something that they themselves made.<br/>
The meaning of that is: ‘I want to get more intimate with you personally’.<br/>
It is an old tradition of the refined noble women of Rozes.<br/>
It is currently a thrown away practice, and there’s practically no one doing that lately.<br/>
But I have been told by my personal tutor: ‘There’s times when men misunderstand, so don’t do something like that, okay?’.<br/>
Princess Sofia is the personage who has the highest and most thorough education of the country. <br/>
There’s no way she doesn’t know about that.<br/>
In other words, she knowingly did it.<br/>
To the Hero of Rozes, Takatsuki Makoto-sama.<br/>
Cold sweat passed through my back.<br/>
(…I definitely must not act rudely towards Takatsuki-sama.) (Chris)<br/>
"You are making a scary face there, Chris. What’s the matter?" (Nina)<br/>
"No, there’s no problem." (Chris)<br/>
That’s right, no problem.<br/>
On the contrary.<br/>
(But this matter is way too much for me to take on my own…) (Chris)<br/>
Let’s consult with Fujiwara-sama immediately after this.<br/>
Together with Nina.<br/>
I etched this deeply in my heart.<br/>
That the Country Designated Hero of Rozes, Takatsuki Makoto-sama…might be the person Princess Sofia loves.<br/>
◇◇<br/>
 -Takatsuki Makoto POV-<br/>
"I am sorry, Takki-dono, but I have to return to Makkaren for a bit." (Fujiwara)<br/>
"You will return a few days later, right?" (Makoto)<br/>
Because of helping out in the restoration of the capital, Fuji-yan left a massive amount of work in Makkaren undone, so he is gonna be going back to Makkaren for now.<br/>
Lucy, Sa-san, and I will be staying in Horun. <br/>
Fortunately, the princess has prepared us a place to stay at! <br/>
What got me curious a bit was the attitude of Chris-san.<br/>
Until now, it felt like there was a bit of distance between us since she simply knew me as a friend of Fuji-yan, but…<br/>
"Takatsuki-sama, when you return to Makkaren, I will prepare the highest quality room, and have a chef of us prepare meals for you, so if you have any request, just tell me, okay?!" (Chris)<br/>
"N-No, I am okay with something normal." (Makoto)<br/>
She is worrying about me quite a lot now.<br/>
The title of Hero really is impressive.<br/>
I must be careful not to let it get on my head…<br/>
◇◇<br/>
The next morning.<br/>
I did my daily prayer to Noah-sama, and left for my morning training.<br/>
The place is the garden in the Rozes Castle that has the biggest fountain.<br/>
(There’s…no Spirits at all.) (Makoto)<br/>
Well, can’t be helped in the Rozes Castle.<br/>
I deactivate [Clear Mind].<br/>
"Spirit-sans, Spirit-sans." (Makoto)<br/>
I try using Spirit Magic without the mind stabilizing skill.<br/>
After a good while small amount of Spirits begin to gather, and…<br/>
A giant water mass was created.<br/>
"Yeah, it ain’t that different…" (Makoto)<br/>
Is the way of doing it different?<br/>
Or is it because there’s so few Spirits in the Castle?<br/>
Or maybe the influence of the Holy God?<br/>
"Hero-dono?" <br/>
I was spoken to.<br/>
When I look back, the former guardian knight was standing there.<br/>
No, not former, he has returned to being a guardian knight. <br/>
"Ah, good morning." (Makoto)<br/>
"Are you training this early in the morning?" <br/>
"You as well, patrolling must be tough." (Makoto)<br/>
"Yeah, there’s no knowing when monsters might appear, so we have a patrol schedule with shifts that covers all 24 hours." <br/>
Damn.<br/>
Should I be helping them out too?<br/>
I am the Hired Hero of the Water Country after all.<br/>
"By the way, I was able to go back to being a Guardian Knight thanks to you, Hero-dono! You have my gratitude!" <br/>
"No, that was where you were originally anyways." (Makoto)<br/>
"My family is a family that has been holding the title of The Shield of the Rozes Royalty for generations. Thanks to you, I have regained my honor!" <br/>
Uwaah…and I took away that important position of his?<br/>
The guilt…<br/>
But the old man couldn’t feel how awkward I was feeling and simply laughed out loud.<br/>
"This is one breathtaking garden no matter how many times I see it, don’t you think so as well?" <br/>
The great garden of Rozes Castle has flowers blooming all year long.<br/>
"Y-Yeah." (Makoto)<br/>
I honestly am not interested in flowers at all. I was only seeing whether there are Spirits or not.<br/>
"We have to do our best in order to protect this sight." <br/>
The old man speaks while caressing a flower as if admiring it.<br/>
…It doesn’t fit a brawny big man that much, but I shouldn’t tease him here.<br/>
The old man is unexpectedly a romanticist, huh.<br/>
"When the Great Demon Lord resurrects, I will become the shield of our Hero-dono." <br/>
"Yeah, I will be counting on you." (Makoto)<br/>
My defense is paper after all.<br/>
The Skill of the old man that allowed him to tank an attack of that Giant and still be completely alright is really reliable.<br/>
"By the way, what was the Northern Expedition Plan that Princess Sofia spoke of?" (Makoto)<br/>
That’s apparently going to be my first job after being appointed a Hero.<br/>
"Ooh, about that plan! Hero-dono, you know about us being in the west continent and there being a continent at the north, right?" <br/>
"Uhm, demons live in the north continent, was it?" (Makoto)<br/>
I remember learning about it in the Water Temple.<br/>
"Yeah. The 9 Demon Generals that obeyed the Great Demon Lord. The north continent is ruled by the 3 that survived and are acting as Demon Lords." <br/>
I have heard about that.<br/>
It is also called the Demonic Continent.<br/>
"Could the Northern Expedition Plan be…" (Makoto)<br/>
I feel like I have an idea about what it is now.<br/>
"Before the Great Demon Lord revives, we will defeat all the Demon Lords in the northern continent. That’s the Northern Expedition Plan." <br/>
"Ooh…" (Makoto)<br/>
Demon Lord extermination.<br/>
Finally an event like that.<br/>
As an RPG player, there’s a lot to think about in this, but I feel like my current strength won’t be enough.<br/>
As I thought, I should master Spirit Magic.<br/>
"Are you not scared, Hero-dono?" <br/>
"Eh? Yeah, I don’t know how strong those Demon Lords are, but looks like I gotta train my magic more." (Makoto)<br/>
"You even look like you are looking forward to it. How dependable." <br/>
I look like that, huh.<br/>
Sounds like I am a dangerous guy.<br/>
"Well then, I will be returning to my patrolling." <br/>
"Alright. Thanks for teaching me a lot of things." (Makoto)<br/>
I give my thanks to the old man, and return to my training.<br/>
Or more like, I would prefer if you were to speak to me in a more familiar manner though.<br/>
Like before.<br/>
(Makoto, you are doing well with the people of the Water Country, huh.) (Noah)<br/>
"Noah-sama." (Makoto)<br/>
(I have spoken to the Water Goddess, Eir. She says she doesn’t mind you being the Hero. There’s no strong fighters in the Water Country, so she was happy, you know?) (Noah)<br/>
"I see… So you can talk to the Holy Gods?" (Makoto)<br/>
Weren’t they your sworn enemies?<br/>
(Having a war a long time ago doesn’t mean that we can’t talk after, right?) (Noah)<br/>
"Well, that’s true…" (Makoto)<br/>
If you couldn’t speak to an enemy country after war, Americans wouldn’t be able to speak with anyone.<br/>
The Divine Realm War seems to have been quite a long time ago and all.<br/>
(That’s how it is. But you won’t be able to get the Divine Protection of the Water Goddess. Don’t expect that, okay?) (Noah)<br/>
"I wouldn’t ask for such luxury. I am good enough with the Divine Protection of you, Noah-sama." (Makoto)<br/>
(Good boy, good boy. Do your best~.) (Noah)<br/>
I couldn’t hear the voice of Noah-sama anymore. <br/>
"Haah…" (Makoto)<br/>
Oh well, let’s work hard in my training.<br/>
Battles against Demon Lords are apparently waiting ahead after all.<br/>
…A Hero, huh.<br/>
What’s gonna happen, I wonder.<br/>
—Fufu!<br/>
Hm?<br/>
I kind of heard a laugh?<br/>
Am I hearing things?<br/>
