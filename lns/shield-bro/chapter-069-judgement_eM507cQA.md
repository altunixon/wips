The cliffhanging never stops <br/>
Chapter 69 <br/>
 <br/>
Judgement  <br/>
 <br/>
Raphtalia appears behind the bitch and slashes. <br/>
Clang! The bitch barely blocks Raphtalia's sword with her sword by turning around. <br/>
There was probably another illusion piled upon the one that was dispelled. <br/>
 <br/>
"You're just a pebble on the side of the road!" <br/>
"To treat others as pebbles...... Is that that attitude of one meant to rule!?" <br/>
 <br/>
Raphtalia and bitch continue their game of cat and mouse while also insulting each other. <br/>
Bitch's sword must have been expensive. However, she is unable to break Raphtalia's sword. <br/>
I don't know if it's simply because Raphtalia's ability exceeds hers, I have to hurry and help... <br/>
 <br/>
"I will not collapse just yet!" <br/>
 <br/>
Motoyasu who was on the ground from Self-Burning Curse gets up with great difficulty and is barely able to stand in front of me. <br/>
 <br/>
"You think you can stop me with these kind of burns? I will not acknowledge it!" <br/>
 <br/>
Although Motoyasu has taken considerable damage from Self Curse Burning, he continues on without consideration for his body. <br/>
His steps are a little unsteady. <br/>
 <br/>
"This amount of damage is nothing that can't be fixed with recovery magic." <br/>
"Do you have someone who can apply it?" <br/>
 <br/>
I do not know what kind of magic Motoyasu uses. <br/>
When I look at his companions I see the one that wasn't stabbed desperately using recover magic. <br/>
Raphtalia and the bitch are still engaging each other in close combat, neither of them are backing off. <br/>
 <br/>
"Don't forget about Firo either~!" <br/>
"Firo!? Are you okay?" <br/>
 <br/>
Firo should have been induced into a state of frenzy when I took out the shield of anger. But she's showing no signs of losing her mind. <br/>
After the shield of anger's second form shield of anger 2 was unlocked, it's power increased without changing to that form. <br/>
I am also able to send my companions into a frenzy with the angry dragon's roar. <br/>
Maybe that's why I can stop the shield of anger 1 from from sending Firo out of control. <br/>
 <br/>
"Whats up?" <br/>
 <br/>
When I look at Firo's head...... her ahoge is glowing. <br/>
 <br/>
"Somehow my body has become extremely light" <br/>
 <br/>
Black flames are covering Firo, her white limbs are being dyed black. <br/>
Firo's mind doesn't seem to be eroded though...... <br/>
It seems the reward from the Queen of Philorials is amazing. <br/>
 <br/>
"I am one who commands the origin of power. I have read and deciphered a law of nature. Cure this person!" <br/>
"Al ・Tzuvait ・Heal!" <br/>
 <br/>
Motoyasu's companion casts healing magic him after a long chant. <br/>
Range recovery, they had such a hand available? <br/>
 <br/>
"You saved me!" <br/>
 <br/>
But......Motoyasu, you have made one big miscalculation. <br/>
The light of recovery falls onto Motoyasu and his group to heal. <br/>
 <br/>
"Alright......Huh?" <br/>
 <br/>
The recovery magic that Motoyasu was waiting for barely did anything for him. Motoyasu tilted his neck looking puzzled. <br/>
 <br/>
"Did you think you could recover completely with just one cast? I'm sorry to disappoint you. I have my own hand to prevent that." <br/>
 <br/>
This is funny, the side effect of Self-Burning Curse slows down healing. <br/>
His long awaited recovery magic barely did anything. <br/>
 <br/>
"I think the outcome is decided." <br/>
 <br/>
His companions turn towards Raphtalia and starts chanting magic. <br/>
 <br/>
"Firo" <br/>
 <br/>
I give instructions to support Raphtalia. <br/>
 <br/>
"Okay~!" <br/>
 <br/>
Firo charges even faster than earlier. <br/>
As Firo approaches Raphtalia who is preparing to defend with her sword, both Raphtalia and the bitch back off to start preparing magic. <br/>
 <br/>
"Not yet!" <br/>
 <br/>
Without learning his lesson Motoyasu tries to stab me with his spear. <br/>
 <br/>
"Air Strike Javelin!" <br/>
 <br/>
A thrown spear flies towards me. <br/>
 <br/>
"Like that would work!" <br/>
 <br/>
I catch the flying spear. <br/>
Gakin! Sounds of metal clashing rings out when I grab the spear. <br/>
When I completely stop the spear, it disappears from my hand and reappears in Motoyasu's. <br/>
Throwing skills...... Certainly Self Curse Burning is ineffective at a long distance. <br/>
If you are a gamer you would understand after seeing it once. <br/>
 <br/>
"I won't......I won't lose here! If I lose then princess Melty, Raphtalia-chan, and Firo-chan will all become tools for the devil of the shield." <br/>
 <br/>
...... In a way coming all the way here believing in justice in itself is somewhat praiseworthy. <br/>
But I am treated as the villain. <br/>
No way, In Motoyasu's eyes am I a mid-boss within a game? <br/>
What an unpleasant treatment. Who is a boss character. <br/>
 <br/>
"I will absolutely help you!" <br/>
"A buffoon of a womaniser coming here, it's too pathetic." <br/>
 <br/>
Don't you understand you're the one being brainwashed? <br/>
It's such a waste to not be directing your passion somewhere more productive...... <br/>
 <br/>
"Damn......" <br/>
 <br/>
He doesn't even respond to my remark. His Companions are being trampled on by Firo. <br/>
Well, his unyielding will is certainly Hero-like. <br/>
However, if you insist of blindly following justice like that, then there is no saving you. <br/>
 <br/>
"Give it up, you cannot beat us." <br/>
 <br/>
You don't even know your allies are the ones behind this. <br/>
I look at Melty anxiously while thinking about what's to do next. <br/>
Victory or defeat is also decided on whether or not the cage can be destroyed. <br/>
It is admirable that she can act so bravely knowing her own older sister is trying to have her assassinated. <br/>
 <br/>
......Killing intent surges within me. <br/>
But if I murder anyone here my innocence will never be proven. <br/>
If I murder anyone, I will be no different than that trash who is trying to frame me. <br/>
I refuse to become an existence similar to trash. <br/>
To even sacrifice your own flesh and blood without hesitation. <br/>
Is that really alright? <br/>
No, I will prove my innocence! <br/>
 <br/>
"Not yet......I haven't lost yeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeet!" <br/>
 <br/>
Motoyasu suicidally charges me, it's like he;s trying to die an honourable death. <br/>
It will be deicide with the next move- <br/>
 <br/>
right before a decide a foreign sound echoes. <br/>
Applause is heard from a strange place. <br/>
 <br/>
"Iya~...... as expected of the spear, truly a strong will. It was a good show." <br/>
 <br/>
The area is filled with magical pressure. <br/>
All of Firo's feathers stand on end as she covers Rapthalia. <br/>
 <br/>
"Eh--" <br/>
"Mel-chan!' <br/>
"Kyaaaaaaaaaaaaaa!" <br/>
"Uwaaaaaaaaaaaaa!" <br/>
"I-I am a princess! how dare you treat me with so impolitely--" <br/>
"Firo-cha--fube!" <br/>
 <br/>
And without any hesistation,everyone including Bitch and Motoyasu were kicked towards me, freely using high-speed magic Firo appears in front of me <br/>
Everyone, whether friend or foe is gathered together at my feet by Firo. <br/>
 <br/>
"Master! We'll defend with everything!" <br/>
"What's happening Sudden-" <br/>
"Hurry up! Something big is about to come!" <br/>
"Damn! I know!" <br/>
 <br/>
While Firo was watching with a threatening attitude, while I use Shield Prison, Air Strike Shield, and Second Shield. <br/>
Just as the shields appear a huge pillar of light poured down on us from the sky. <br/>
 <br/>
"Guu......" <br/>
 <br/>
It was a heavy attack that shook my body to it's core <br/>
I endure it while chanting Fast Heal. <br/>
Air Strike Shield and Second Shield are blown away immediately, and Shield Prison is barely holding up. <br/>
As the shield is protecting everyone from the sky a Bakin sound could be heard. <br/>
The Prison is destroyed and the light falls onto me. My shield is somehow blocking the thick beam of light. <br/>
As I was about to slip Firo wraps her wings around me and supports me. <br/>
 <br/>
"Uguguguuuuuuuuuu......" <br/>
 <br/>
The light reduces my physical strength. <br/>
 <br/>
"A little more......It's over!" <br/>
 <br/>
The light suddenly vanishes but I still hold my shield ready. <br/>
Firo stands up and covers everyone with her wings. <br/>
The area around us......It's all scorched-earth. <br/>
It looks like a meteor fell and we were at it's epicentre. <br/>
There were some villagers groaning outside the crater that was part of the aftermath of the magic the enemy cast. <br/>
It was horrible. <br/>
 <br/>
"Wh-What on earth......" <br/>
"Oh my what's this? To think the devil of the shield could withstand the High class synthesis magic [Judgement] and remain calm." <br/>
 <br/>
When I look towards the voice, what greeted me was the smiling face of the priest back in the church of castle town. <br/>
Followed by a dozen church officials, with some knights mixed in. <br/>
 <br/>
"You.....!" <br/>
 <br/>
Motoyasu looks at the priest in frustration. <br/>
They're not your reinforcements? <br/>
No wait, Motoyasu would have been caught up in that blow as well. <br/>
This is...... <br/>
 <br/>
"Oh dear oh dear, How could I forget to introduce myself. I am the pope of the Church of Three Heroes."
