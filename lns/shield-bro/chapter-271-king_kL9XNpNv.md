"Hey if it isn't father-in-law. Should I wash your back?" <br/>
"It's fine. Rather, it's already been washed." <br/>
 <br/>
...Motoyasu came over. <br/>
There is the reason why Firo fled. <br/>
Together with him are his three companions. Behind them, Ren is also there. <br/>
 <br/>
Are you coming in the bath with that Motoyasu...? <br/>
If it were me I'd come up with some reason and enter at a different time. <br/>
 <br/>
Huh? The women's bath became noisy. <br/>
 <br/>
"Kyua!" <br/>
 <br/>
Even Gaelion came over. <br/>
Did Ren bring him along? <br/>
Which means, Taniko and Female Knight should be in the women's bath as well. <br/>
Gaelion came flying over here, then soaked on the bath. <br/>
 <br/>
"Among you three, two are female right? Go to the women's bath." [He's talking about Motoyasu 3 companions, the Filo Rials] <br/>
"What's with that! Are you trying to separate me from Mokkun!?" <br/>
"That's right, no mater what you say, I'll aaalways be with Moーchan!" <br/>
 <br/>
The red one declared that while looking agitated, the blue one agreed. <br/>
Right now they're in human form. <br/>
Looking it over again, though their colors and hairdos are different from Firo, their physiques are similar. <br/>
 <br/>
"Even though you're that female's owner, don't push it!" [red one] <br/>
 <br/>
For some reason, with a strong-willed expression she raises a shrill voice. <br/>
Motoyasu to be liked with this type of strong desire to monopolize, is he releasing some kind of pheromones? <br/>
To keep him company is a pain. <br/>
 <br/>
"Father-in-law said it's no good. C'mon you two, go to the women's bath." <br/>
"That's right. Kuー and Mamire are female so you're going to the women's bath." <br/>
 <br/>
And like that, Midori ["the green one"] happily pushed the two other's backs and forcibly drove them away to the hedge. <br/>
As I thought, she's a little black-hearted. <br/>
However, it's better than the usual noisiness. <br/>
Drive them away quickly. <br/>
 <br/>
""Buー!"" <br/>
 <br/>
As they leave behind the same complaint as Firo usually does, the two jump over the hedge. <br/>
After that, a very happy-looking Midori took Motoyasu's arm and walked over here. <br/>
 <br/>
"All riーght, I'm washing Midoriー" <br/>
"Yes!" <br/>
 <br/>
In an extremely good mood Midori was washed by Motoyasu. <br/>
Ren was pleasantly watching that scene. <br/>
 <br/>
"So Naofumi also came over." (Ren) <br/>
"That's right. More importantly, the women's bath sure is noisy." <br/>
"There were some who said they wanted to come along so I took them over." <br/>
"So that was it after all." <br/>
 <br/>
Over there is really a noisy state of affairs. <br/>
"Kyaー" those kinds of screams like they're having fun can be heard. <br/>
 <br/>
"This is a good water." <br/>
"Indeed. How is the situation of the curse?" <br/>
"I think it's probably getting better. Just a little but today I got some experience." <br/>
"Oh really?" <br/>
 <br/>
Me too, I'm confident that since I started entering the hot springs little-by-little I can see my Status Degradation getting cured more rapidly. <br/>
Well then... taking a long bath is also good but, is it about time to get up? <br/>
Thinking the same, Rishia and Itsuki get up from the spring. <br/>
 <br/>
"Then, I'm leaving first. Recover yourself at ease." <br/>
"Sure." <br/>
 <br/>
It was by the time I was having such a conversation with Ren, I think. <br/>
Motoyasu was walking along the hedge and started peeping. <br/>
 <br/>
"Motoyasu-san. Stop this." <br/>
"What are you saying, Midori. I must confirm Firo-tan's growth with my eyes no matter what. For instance, even if there's a lot of pigs there, enough to make me nauseous, I'm not afraid." <br/>
 <br/>
Oh c'mon already... even if Motoyasu comes to the bath his broken state doesn't change? <br/>
Something troublesome seems to be starting. <br/>
This time, let me get up quickly. <br/>
 <br/>
"What are you doing!" <br/>
 <br/>
Ren took care of cautioning Motoyasu who started doing that. <br/>
Previously, you were aiming for the "cool", lucky lecher act, weren't you? <br/>
Judging by appearance, he cautioned him seriously, but. <br/>
 <br/>
"Fue~..." <br/>
 <br/>
To the Motoyasu trying to peek in right before her eyes, Rishia leaked out her voice. <br/>
Indeed, trying to peek with a woman right next to you! That guy is a Hero. <br/>
In a different sense. <br/>
 <br/>
"Even though I was thinking of how much I want to see Firo-tan." <br/>
"Indeed, you would think to want to see Firo-san, right?" <br/>
 <br/>
Itsuki gets on board with Motoyasu's words. <br/>
What's with that? Why are you getting on board. <br/>
 <br/>
"Itsuki-sama! What are you saying?" <br/>
"But you heard it how Firo-san has become pretty too, right? That's in that meaning, isn't it?" [the word here is kirei, which means both pretty and clean. Firo became "kirei" when Naofumi washed her in the previous chapter] <br/>
 <br/>
Indeed, when I washed Firo she asked 'Is Firo pretty~?', is that what you're talking about? <br/>
So you're still a little weird after all. <br/>
 <br/>
"All right, then Itsuki, let's go peep in on the women's bath together!" <br/>
"Understood." <br/>
"Stop Itsuki!" <br/>
"Please stop, Itsuki-sama!" <br/>
"Understood." <br/>
 <br/>
This routine sure is troublesome. <br/>
Should I get up already? <br/>
 <br/>
"Come on, Midori, become a foothold!" <br/>
 <br/>
Now you're trying to make a foothold to peep in!? <br/>
It's dislikable isn't it. Midori wanted to come in the bath with Motoyasu after all. <br/>
 <br/>
"I don't want to." <br/>
 <br/>
Just as one thought, it was rejected. <br/>
 <br/>
"Nono, Midori, here you must follow my order." <br/>
 <br/>
And so, Motoyaso took off the towel that was wrapping around Midori. <br/>
Why did you take off the towel!? <br/>
 <br/>
"""!?""" <br/>
 <br/>
Ren, Itsuki, Rishia all petrified in an instant. <br/>
I was looking away as I was leaving so I didn't see it, what's up? <br/>
 <br/>
"A... u... It, it's embarrassing." <br/>
 <br/>
For the first time Midori went into his Filo Rial form in front of me. <br/>
It's huge! <br/>
Even bigger than Firo in her Filo Rial form. <br/>
While in human form they don't differ much, even though among the 3 she's shortest, in Filo Rial form she's the tallest? <br/>
Is it because he's male? <br/>
No, in our Filo Rial barn there are other males but they're not this big. <br/>
 <br/>
"Huge!" Ren <br/>
"It's big." Itsuki <br/>
"Fueeeeee..." <br/>
 <br/>
Motoyasu jumped on the embarrassed Midori's back and tried peeking over the hedge. <br/>
Certainly I also think he's big but... why are you all surprised that much? <br/>
 <br/>
"Naofumi also saw it?" Ren <br/>
"Saw what?" <br/>
"You didn't see it!?" <br/>
"Like I say, saw what?" <br/>
"Before that one transformed, underneath the towel――" <br/>
"Wa, Waaaaaaa!" <br/>
 <br/>
Midori flails about and Motoyasu slips off, he sinks into the spring. <br/>
Midori then shuts up Ren's mouth. <br/>
 <br/>
"Truly a King!" <br/>
 <br/>
However, Itsuki ended up giving the continuation. <br/>
Don't let your emotions show up only at a time like this! <br/>
Was it really something to be that astonished about? <br/>
 <br/>
"King? Isn't that because he's a male?" <br/>
"That's not it..." <br/>
"Waaaaaaaaaa! Stooooooooop!" <br/>
"Understood." <br/>
 <br/>
Huh? <br/>
 <br/>
I don't quite get it. <br/>
 <br/>
"Naofumi-sama, did something happen?" <br/>
 <br/>
Rafutalia peeks over from the hedge, showing her face. <br/>
 <br/>
"Yeah, apparently this idiot tried peeping again but, Midori here――" <br/>
"Please. Not one more word, don't cause an uproar!" <br/>
 <br/>
Midori who returned to human form and covered his nether regions with the towel supplicated. <br/>
What are you so afraid of? <br/>
 <br/>
"Is that so?" <br/>
"Naofumi-sama... didn't participate, right?" Rafutalia <br/>
"Yeah, I was just trying to leave." <br/>
 <br/>
Already at the vicinity of the dressing room I wave my hand at Rafutalia as I answer. <br/>
Or should I say, don't you peep on the men's bath. <br/>
 <br/>
"...A little..." <br/>
"A? Come again?" <br/>
 <br/>
I'm not particularly going deaf. <br/>
The words Rafutalia was muttering, I heard them word for word. <br/>
Therefore, I try asking. <br/>
 <br/>
"You wanted me to see, is it?" <br/>
 <br/>
It's a fact that it's of no interest, but well. <br/>
At any rate, Rafutalia saying that kind of thing sure is unusual. <br/>
Is there some reason... Ah, is that it? <br/>
 <br/>
"Were you playing some kind of game? If you made me peep you'd win, that kind of game?" <br/>
"Haa......" [indeed, that was god-like dense] <br/>
 <br/>
So it was like that. <br/>
That noisy bunch came over to the bath so you ended up playing some weird game. <br/>
Those guys seem to have a lot of fun teasing me so Rafutalia too got pulled into it. <br/>
 <br/>
The principal offender, is it Melty? <br/>
Kiel would also be a strong candidate, but it seems she came into the men's bath previously. <br/>
Who else came I don't know. <br/>
Well, if they're getting along it's fine. <br/>
 <br/>
"Fu...." <br/>
 <br/>
Ignoring that situation was Gaelion, who went flying over to the hedge happily. <br/>
You're trying to peep, aren't you. Moreover it's the papa Gaelion. <br/>
Don't get aroused over humans. <br/>
 <br/>
"Muー! Don't come here!" <br/>
 <br/>
To the Gaelion who was trying to peep from the hedge, Firo threw a bucked right on his face, a clean hit. <br/>
 <br/>
"Kyuaa..." <br/>
 <br/>
With a splash, Gaelion sunk on the spring. <br/>
Are you an idiot? <br/>
Really an incorrigible fellow. <br/>
 <br/>
"Anyway, I'm leaving. Rafutalia and everyone else soak up at your leisure." <br/>
"Haa... Understood." <br/>
 <br/>
Motoyasu sitting in a seiza alone this time is a inconsequential complement.
