Chapter 378: The Rise of the Shield Hero<br/>
"What the hell is this?"<br/>
I unintentionally raise a laugh.<br/>
What I got my hands on and read was a book titled Rock Valley’s Heroic Legend.<br/>
Right now, the store I’m in is the Rock Valley Book Store.<br/>
It appears to be a magic shop, but they sell normal books too.<br/>
"What’s wrong?"<br/>
While I stand there reading, a child who looks like Elena comes up and talks to me.<br/>
I silently point to the page and furrow my brow.<br/>
"It’s quite a terrible story."<br/>
"There are a few things that diverge from reality here."<br/>
The person Glass’s waiting for is a woman.<br/>
Most of the monsters are attributed as concepts of the whole race. I feel sorry for the actual ones.<br/>
"What’s wrong?"<br/>
"Rafu~?"<br/>
Firo and Raph-chan look at me in wonder as I give a bitter smile.<br/>
"Hmm? Your guys’ existences are in doubt, it seems."<br/>
"Eh…?"<br/>
It’s mean to call them a collection of monsters with the same name.<br/>
Why can’t they just see her as a Filo Rial?<br/>
"But it’s been a while since I’ve come to this world. Quite a bit has changed."<br/>
I walk out of the book store and look at the sky.<br/>
A giant tree towers over the surroundings.<br/>
So that’s Rock Valley’s special god tree, is it?<br/>
Since it was written that Kiel was protecting it… I strain my eyes and try to focus on it.<br/>
… Yep. It’s the crepe tree.<br/>
"Raphtalia, that tree is disgusting, so go level it to the ground. Kiel isn’t here anymore, so it’s fine."<br/>
"I don’t want to. And if we do that, it’ll start an uproar!"<br/>
"I’ll bet. But as I thought, I can’t get used to that tree."<br/>
And when I watch the traffic on the road, I see quite a few familiar races walking around.<br/>
After defeating the Bitch Goddess, when the Spirits pressed me for an answer, I chose everything.<br/>
Something close to the Bitch’s fragments. I divided parts of me between this world and the modern one. Raphtalia, Atlas, and I, who would be able to use our godly powers to protect the world, went on a journey following the Spirits’ words.<br/>
After that, a lot has happened.<br/>
It’s because the rules vary by the world.<br/>
We exist as a spiritual force to protect worlds from invading gods.<br/>
Because of that, we’ve battled in as many places as there are stars in the sky.<br/>
The rule that eight worlds had to combine for the god to descend existed in some worlds, and did not in others.<br/>
But without corresponding to that rule, well, we pretty much descended to the absolute limit the world would permit.<br/>
Once we figured out just where the god was pulling the strings, we would bring him down before he could do anything else.<br/>
And with the repetition of battles like that, the months and years passed before I knew it.<br/>
That fragment was pretty much me sending myself on a holiday.<br/>
The one who took up permanent residence in the world experienced various happenings every day, but in the end, it seems he had a fun life.<br/>
And now, he’s returned to me.<br/>
After he died, it seems much has happened in this world.<br/>
But unfair calamities like the wave didn’t come about again.<br/>
In all the worlds I resolved matters in, I erected a barrier so no god could descend again.<br/>
Me being in this world after so long is like a well-deserved holiday.<br/>
I mean, with all that’s happened, I’m tired.<br/>
Arc even said I could take a break if I wanted to.<br/>
That cat occasionally saves us, and is occasionally saved by us.<br/>
There are plenty of worlds where it would have been dangerous if he wasn’t there.<br/>
And there are plenty of worlds that would have been in danger without us.<br/>
While similar to mine, his fighting style is on another level.<br/>
He specializes in killing gods, and he’s no good in anything else.<br/>
Instead of getting into a war of attrition between gods, he has a convenient ability where he just kills them.<br/>
But in exchange, bluntly, if it was someone from the world, even a baby could beat him.<br/>
It seems he works by logic like that.<br/>
Well, if it has to do with punching, I guess I can’t beat a baby either.<br/>
In exchange, Raphtalia fights for me, though.<br/>
Ah, I digressed.<br/>
Anyways, as a god, I’ve devoted myself to fighting.<br/>
Should I call this my main body?<br/>
"Is Rock Valley a monarchy? Or a republic? An empire? Each history book seems to differ a bit."<br/>
"I bet it’s had a long history. Firo, do you know anything about that?"<br/>
"Hmm… when Firo was with Mel-chan, it was a monarchy."<br/>
Fumu… Firo’s memory ability is a bit dubious, but I’ll rely on it.<br/>
Ah, that’s right.<br/>
We’ve paid a visit to this world after all this time.<br/>
When I was relying on the memories of my fragment to walk the streets, Firo and Raph-chan sensed my presence and appeared.<br/>
Their existences were doubted, but they’re right here.<br/>
But… Raphshild… the Raph race has gotten quite the grand name.<br/>
Ah, I spotted one… it’s a tanuki-esque bear.<br/>
It’s pulling a carriage and letting children ride on its back.<br/>
It looks like it’s treated as a sociable, docile monster.<br/>
But it doesn’t appear to have much battle prowess.<br/>
This is like a Filo Rial that wasn’t raised by Heroes, I guess.<br/>
I also sense that Gaelion’s still here.<br/>
I guess I’ll drop by later.<br/>
Right now, I’m in the country, Rock Valley.<br/>
I’m not really sure if it’s an empire or a republic.<br/>
But it looks like it’s a peaceful country.<br/>
People resembling Kiel’s puppy mode are taking care of the crepe tree.<br/>
The crepes that grow from it are this country’s specialty, just by raising your hand into the air, you can eat them.<br/>
Well, all that means is that this disgusting tree is towering over the world.<br/>
Around it, a large castle town spreads out.<br/>
It faces the sea, and it was once… Raphtalia’s birthplace<br/>
Right now, it functions as a sort of port city.<br/>
"Firo."<br/>
"What~?"<br/>
"You’re in human shape, but you won’t take up your Filo Rial form?"<br/>
Well, I guess it’ll cause an uproar if she does it here.<br/>
I mean, she’s supposed to be a legendary bird.<br/>
"Well, you see, this place is a bit narrow."<br/>
Is that so?<br/>
I guess she’s grown quite big.<br/>
"Yeah, Raph-chan is the same."<br/>
"Rafu~."<br/>
When I reunited with Raph-chan, I was shocked.<br/>
He was standing in quite a remote place.<br/>
The entire Raph-race came to greet us, and we were led to a tanuki the size of a mountain.<br/>
It took a while for me to notice it was Raph-chan.<br/>
Right now, he’s transformed to the same size as when we first met.<br/>
"Firo, you see. Firo finally found master again. Don’t leave me alone this time."<br/>
"Ah, yes, yes."<br/>
Does Firo even realize just how much time has passed since then?<br/>
She doesn’t seem any different than before.<br/>
Well, her essence is getting closer to that of a God’s, and I do think she’ll be able to breach the wall around the world.<br/>
She’s become able to clad herself in fire as she flies, and when a Bird of fire greeted us as we approached the world, I was surprised.<br/>
I think that form’s one of her transformations, but I wonder.<br/>
"Rafu~."<br/>
"Raph-chan says he wants to protect this world from the shadows, so he’ll stay home."<br/>
"I see, I see. Good boy, Raph-chan. Unlike some bird who doesn’t mature no matter how many centuries pass."<br/>
"Who’s that~?"<br/>
It’s you. You.<br/>
"Rafu…"<br/>
I pat an embarrassed Raph-chan as I walk around the city.<br/>
The unfamiliar townscape. But there were some familiar things, and they bring back some deep emotions.<br/>
"Is Fitoria still around?"<br/>
"Yeah, she’s really annoying. She keeps telling Firo to just succeed her already. She says she wants to retire."<br/>
I think that bird has lived long enough, but she has eternal youth.<br/>
I guess Firo drank that medicine too.<br/>
But it would be uncouth to ask about the others.<br/>
I’ll bet Firo’s met with many a painful farewell.<br/>
"Master is too mean. You did so many things with everyone, but never with Firo."<br/>
Firo starts talking about this and that with a pouty expression.<br/>
"You said Mel-chan was there, so it was no good, but you did stuff with Mel-chan too."<br/>
"Please, just leave it at that. I’ll be with you for a while now, right?" (Naofumi)<br/>
I pat the top of Firo’s head.<br/>
In a good mood, Firo quiets down.<br/>
As not to lose, Raph-chan climbs up to the top of my head and strikes a pose.<br/>
"Ah, yes, yes. You too, Raph-chan."<br/>
After patting them for a while, my mood improves too.<br/>
"Naofumi-sama, please pat me as well."<br/>
Atlas comes from within the Shield and volunteers herself.<br/>
"You get pat every day, don’t you?"<br/>
"Even if it’s every day, that doesn’t mean it’s enough."<br/>
"Yeah, yeah."<br/>
"Firo wants to be with master. This time, you’ll take me along, right!?"<br/>
"Got it, got it."<br/>
Now, this world only has a handful of people who know me.<br/>
Like that, I walk around the city normally, and no one noticed I was the Hero of the Shield.<br/>
No, perhaps it’s at the level where they think I’m cosplaying a legendary Hero.<br/>
The culture doesn’t actually seemed to have advanced that far.<br/>
Well, I guess magic-based societies are something like that.<br/>
According to Firo and Raph-chan, they’re in a cycle of prosperity and decline.<br/>
They’ve created flying carriages and ships and set foot into the realm of the sky, so does that mean the world has advanced?<br/>
But that period had planes, so I don’t really feel anything about it.<br/>
Melty’s bloodline, Kiel’s, as well as Sadina’s exist, but they separate from royalty, and are reinstated at some times. It’s a cycle of something like that.<br/>
After the Heroes died, this world still relies on Hero Summoning quite a bit.<br/>
The Four Holy… no, now, is it the Eight? Anyways, they call for them, and sometimes summon vassal Heroes too.<br/>
But there’s no record of a Hero of the Shield appearing after me, which has become a famous topic of discussion.<br/>
"It sure is peaceful."<br/>
The weather is nice, and I can hear the birds calling out happily.<br/>
We walk to the major road, and I make a light lunch in the grassy plains outside before presenting it to Raph-chan and Firo.<br/>
They were very satisfied with the first meal I made for them by hand in a long time.<br/>
"What should we do, Raphtalia?"<br/>
"What do you mean?"<br/>
"Do you want to lead a peaceful life here again?"<br/>
If it’s just for a while, I think I can get permission to rest.<br/>
If it’s just for about a hundred years, it would just be like a normal Sunday for us.<br/>
I mean, we’ve been fighting consecutive battles for a while, and I think the Spirits will wait for us.<br/>
"We could have some children in this world and build a stable household until they become independent."<br/>
Just like the us that stayed in the modern world, and the us that stayed here, I get the feeling we could start something here.<br/>
I mean, despite everything, making a village was… fun.<br/>
Witch and the discrimination I faced are bitter memories, but besides that, my days were quite fun.<br/>
"This time, let Firo in~!"<br/>
"Rafu~!"<br/>
"Me too!" (Atlas)<br/>
"Ah, yes, yes." (Naofumi)<br/>
I ignore the three unrelated parties and ask Raphtalia.<br/>
"That sounds nice…"<br/>
Thinking back, we’ve come a long way.<br/>
It was a choice I made as not to regret, but it’s not like I never had regrets.<br/>
Mourning for the deaths of those close to me truly was sad.<br/>
But more than that, I encountered many people in many worlds, experienced many partings, and received many thanks.<br/>
"… But our battle still continues. For the people who are shedding tears due to a selfish being calling itself God, we have to keep moving forward."<br/>
"… That’s right."<br/>
I can make a fragment for a change of pace if I want.<br/>
I can just have him enjoy this world in my place.<br/>
Right now, we carry the duty of quelling the waves caused by those proclaiming to be gods. We’re more like concepts than anything else.<br/>
So, we can’t stop moving forward… I see.<br/>
I guess I should rest in moderation.<br/>
In the worst case scenario, I can do a time warp and meet the people of this world: Melty, Sadina, Kiel, Fohl.<br/>
It’s not like I’ve left for eternity.<br/>
"Ah, it seems there’s another person planning world assimilation."<br/>
Raphtalia receives a request for support from another god hunter.<br/>
Right, just like Arc, we have comrades who share the same goal as us.<br/>
Though, I’ve never seen ones who are acting from the Spirits’ requests like us.<br/>
Within them, there are people who betray, and people who have changes of heart. How many times have I been deceived…<br/>
Luckily, I’m still here and safe.<br/>
This time, one of those comrades is asking for help.<br/>
Of course, I intend to go there immediately.<br/>
I can’t let them lose to those that perpetuate such unfairness.<br/>
Because that is our will.<br/>
It’s fine. I have Raphtalia.<br/>
I have a world, a world I have to protect.<br/>
I have Firo, and everyone else.<br/>
I can’t meet them at this moment, but it’s not like we’ll never meet again.<br/>
But those that claim to be god can even erase the past.<br/>
And so… I will protect everyone.<br/>
"Then to refresh ourselves, let’s leave a fragment and go."<br/>
In this world, where we’ve become legends who’ve saved the world, let’s have a light hearted adventure.<br/>
If the world is troubled by war, I’ll bet we can achieve peace.<br/>
It’s fine. I’m the Hero of the Shield. This world will give me a warm welcome.<br/>
And I’ll get deceived again.<br/>
… That sounds likely. I’m a little worried.<br/>
"Understood."<br/>
"Firo wants to go with Master."<br/>
"Rafu!"<br/>
Raph-chan is waving his hand.<br/>
Next time we come, will we be bringing Raph-chan with us?<br/>
We leave a fragment behind, and leap through dimensions.<br/>
This time, Firo’s with us.<br/>
I’m with my nostalgic comrades, and I feel that my motivation’s raised itself a bit.<br/>
If I think about it, I was just an Otaku college student who was put under false charges and thrown penniless into another world. From there, I got up to being a noble, and even a God.<br/>
This truly is the Rise of the Shield Hero.<br/>
"Okay! Raphtalia, Atlas, Firo, I’ll be in your care from here on as well!"<br/>
"Yes."<br/>
"Understood."<br/>
"Yeah!"<br/>
Our battle still goes on.<br/>
For the lives lost without reason, we will continue to protect.<br/>
From here on… eternally…<br/>
