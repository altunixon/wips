    <p>Thank you, everyone, for purchasing the fourth Volume of 『Cooking with Wild Game』.</p>

    <p>It has been half a year since the first volume was published in February.</p>

    <p>Time seems to pass fast and slow at the same time… which is unfathomable. No matter what, thanks to the passionate support of everyone, the series managed to publish so many volumes.</p>

    <p>My most sincere gratitude to everyone.</p>

    <p>This volume ends with the “our battle is just beginning” phrase, and just like what it implies, Asuta and company’s fight is just starting.</p>

    <p>Fortunately, the schedule of future volumes is now fixed, and I hope everyone can continue to like this work.</p>

    <p>The story is finally shifting to the Post Station Town, and the next volume will continue this trend.</p>

    <p>But there are all sorts of problems in the Forest’s Edge settlement so the story will develop over there simultaneously.</p>

    <p>The antagonist in the first volume has finally made their appearance before Asuta and company.</p>

    <p>This series has a lot of characters.</p>

    <p>More than thirty characters have already appeared.</p>

    <p>The Wu clan that made their debut in the first volume is a big family of 13, including their baby. Just keeping the track of this group alone is hard enough.</p>

    <p>When this story was being serialized, what I was most concerned about during my first meeting with my editor from Hobby Japan was, “Is it fine to have so many characters?”</p>

    <p>Leaving that aside, what I look forward to as an author is seeing which character will be illustrated by Kochimo-sensei.</p>

    <p>Kamyua Yost made it to the color pages in this volume.</p>

    <p>Everyone had a different impression of this vague character which might be friend or foe, so it must be a challenge to draw him. However, I’m very satisfied with this color drawing as the author.</p>

    <p>Personally, I’m very glad that the easterner merchant was illustrated in this volume.</p>

    <p>Having the characters I created take visual form is a very blissful thing.</p>

    <p>I will throw myself into my creative work with this happiness in mind.</p>

    <p>After so much idle banter, I will end it at this point.</p>

    <p>Then, as usual, I want to thank my editor from Hobby JAPAN, the illustrator, all the staff involved in the publishing of this work, as well as the readers who bought and read this book.</p>

    <p>Let’s meet in the next volume!</p>

    <p>Our battle is just beginning!</p>
