Chapter 313: Retreat<br/>
"What!?"<br/>
The power to steal… Legendary Weapons!?<br/>
What’s with that abnormal ability?<br/>
Wait a second.<br/>
The Hero of the Whip has the Claw because… he stole it?<br/>
"Yeah, the guy who called himself the Hero of the Claw had a rotten personality, so I already sent him to hell." (Tact)<br/>
Again, Tact said it as if it were a matter of course.<br/>
Dead?<br/>
If you kill a hero, isn’t the world supposed to be in trouble… So this is why the wave came so fast!?<br/>
No, it isn’t just the Hero of the Whip.<br/>
Perhaps the same became of all the Seven Star Heroes we can’t come into contact with.<br/>
I don’t know when they were killed, but we haven’t heard anything of them in the past two months.<br/>
So that means that the Seven Stars have been dead for a few months…<br/>
"And, all of the heroes always have totally twisted personalities, you know. They never listen to what I’m trying to say." (Tact)<br/>
Who would want to listen to a guy like this?<br/>
I sure as hell wouldn’t!<br/>
Anger is clouding the thoughts in my head.<br/>
Each and every one of them. Are all of the bastards that get selected as heroes people like this!?<br/>
"I’m going to be saving the world here, so all you guys have to do is die and hand over your weapons." (Tact)<br/>
"As expected of Tact-sama. You plan on saving the legendary weapons from the clutches of those vile heroes over there."<br/>
"What!?"<br/>
Upon hearing that voice, all of my comrades let out their voices before going silent.<br/>
Even Trash.<br/>
"H-how… Why are you here!? Aren’t you supposed to be dead!?" (Naofumi)<br/>
Witch, whom we had presumed dead, showed herself from behind a pillar. She leans her body against my hated enemy and looks down at us as if she were looking down at piles of trash.<br/>
"And as you can see, I’m obviously not dead, Shield." (Witch)<br/>
I can’t believe what I’m seeing.<br/>
She truly should have been dead.<br/>
In the frozen casket Faubley sent back, her corpse was definitely there.<br/>
And her death snuff tape couldn’t have been faked.<br/>
"On my face, and my body. I won’t forgive you for giving me these wounds. I’ll give you a slow death after making you experience a world of pain! Right, Tact-sama?" (Witch)<br/>
There is a scar on her arm, as if it had been rejoined at the joint. Over one of her eyes hangs an eyepatch.<br/>
There’s a similar mark on her leg.<br/>
If my memory serves me well, those are definitely the places the Pig King severed.<br/>
So how is she alive!?<br/>
… Alchemy?<br/>
I heard that the Hero of the Whip also partook in that.<br/>
I see. The Hero who reported Rat was probably him.<br/>
In the past, I’ve heard Rat speak about homunculi.<br/>
But creating a fake that is indistinguishable from the real article is ridiculously difficult. When did they have a chance to swap them out?<br/>
No, more importantly, Witch is alive. That’s all I have to know.<br/>
Hero of the Whip… Genius. Head of his class. Faubley’s academy. Witch’s loss of virginity…<br/>
I see. So that’s where he comes into play. (TL: I wonder if you all remember that)<br/>
Someone who I can’t let live- Witch… And Atlas’s murderer, Tact.<br/>
Even though my Shield’s been stolen, an unquenchable rage sears through my body.<br/>
It’s not related to the Curse of Wrath.<br/>
I just hate him. I just want to kill him.<br/>
"Yeah, the one who sent Malty to that pig must be quite a villain. If it’s her fault that a lot of people died, then she’ll have to make up for it with her life. But I’ll make sure to put her through a world of pain first!" (Tact)<br/>
"And that’s how it is, Mama. How dare you sell me to that Pig King. Now die for your sins. Papa shares the crime too." (Bitch)<br/>
"M-Malty…" (Trash)<br/>
Trash holds the Queen in his arms and stares in silence. His eyes are full of disbelief. He opens his mouth again and again, but no words come out.<br/>
Tact turns his Claws to Fohl, who was nearby, and thrusts.<br/>
"As if an attack like that will-!?" (Fohl)<br/>
He’s fast!<br/>
Fohl’s only become a Hero recently.<br/>
He can’t follow those movements.<br/>
But Fohl emerges without a scratch.<br/>
"Hmm? If I have this shield out, my attack power disappears. How useless." (Tact)<br/>
He makes the Shield disappear, and equips a claw on one hand and a small dagger on the other.<br/>
The dagger greatly resembles the one Rishia holds.<br/>
So that’s how it is.<br/>
Rishia’s mysterious weapon… No, the reason why her Seven Star Weapon is translucent is because its wielder was killed, and its powers were stolen.<br/>
And the weapon itself doesn’t accept Tact as its wielder.<br/>
Perhaps it selected Rishia to rebel against him.<br/>
「Erst Throw」!<br/>
With a throwing motion, Tact embeds the dagger in Ren’s shoulder.<br/>
It seems that Ren won’t be able to use his sword anymore.<br/>
"Gu!"<br/>
"Don’t try anything funny. When you think about Heroes, it’s gotta be swords, right? Hand it over already." (Tact)<br/>
We’ve already suffered heavy damage from gunfire. We’re at an extreme disadvantage.<br/>
I can’t let him take the other legendary weapons too.<br/>
My body won’t move, but I strain every muscle in my body. I fill myself with killing intent<br/>
I won’t let him take anything else from me!<br/>
"Go to hell!" (Naofumi)<br/>
I forcefully encircle my body with chi and magic. I use every bit of power I have left and kick the ground.<br/>
Just a second is enough.<br/>
Enough time for everyone to run…!<br/>
"Wha-"<br/>
Tact blocked the unexpected attack by materializing his stolen shield.<br/>
My fist impacts his body.<br/>
"Hah, how weak. Gufu!?" (Tact)<br/>
My magic and chi explode within his body, and he spits up blood as he’s sent flying all the way behind the throne.<br/>
"Tact!?"<br/>
The gun-toting women all turn their eyes to him, creating a large chance.<br/>
And the heroes don’t miss it.<br/>
"Now! 「Flashing Sword」!" (Ren)<br/>
「Shining Lance」!<br/>
「Flash Arrow」!<br/>
They let out their flashing skills to blind the remaining women.<br/>
"What are you doing!? Hurry up and shoot those guys to death!" (Bitch)<br/>
Witch screams out, but Ren had already kicked down the door.<br/>
"「Transfer Sword」! … As I thought, it’s no good." (Ren)<br/>
「All Dreifach Heal」!<br/>
Through healing magic, the people who had been immobilized through injury somehow find the strength to escape into the castle.<br/>
Ren and Motoyasu lead the way, while Granny and Raphtalia keep the rear.<br/>
Anyways, everyone got over their injuries, but that doesn’t mean they recovered their energy.<br/>
The Queen’s wounds are the deepest.<br/>
The clothes she was wearing have turned black from the oxidized blood covering them.<br/>
If we don’t do something fast, we won’t make it.<br/>
And I can say the same about myself.<br/>
My head is spinning from the pain.<br/>
I don’t know why healing magic won’t work on me.<br/>
It’s a miracle I was even able to stand back there..<br/>
"Mirellia! Stay with me!" (Trash)<br/>
Trash calls out to the Queen. He holds her on his back as he runs behind me.<br/>
"Naofumi-sama!" (Raphtalia)<br/>
"Niichan! Keep yourself together!" (Kiel)<br/>
I’m slumped over on Firo’s back.<br/>
My body won’t move at all.<br/>
The Shield’s Icon has long since vanished from my vision.<br/>
"Naofumi-san, do you understand? Your anger is completely justified, but shall we not retreat for now?" (Itsuki)<br/>
Itsuki quietly orders me.<br/>
He’s right.<br/>
If we fight in an enemy fortress where we don’t know who’s waiting to ambush us, the other heroes will have their weapons taken.<br/>
And what the hell is with his Cheat?<br/>
"Itsuki-sama?" (Rishia)<br/>
"… Yes, let’s quickly retreat from here. Ren-san, how is it? Do you think you can at least transfer the Queen and Naofumi-san somewhere safe?" (Itsuki)<br/>
"It’s impossible… My Transfer Sword won’t activate. Something’s interfering with it." (Ren)<br/>
"KYUA!"<br/>
As if telling us to leave it to him, Gaelion chants magic.<br/>
It’s Dragon Sanctuary.<br/>
They’ve probably cast a magic similar to that on this castle.<br/>
In the past, Firo and Gaelion fought for turf, and when their fields clashed, they were both nullified.<br/>
"KYUAAA"!<br/>
I feel something pass through my body.<br/>
"I’m not letting you get away!"<br/>
I hear a voice from further down the hallway.<br/>
「Dragon Sanctuary」!<br/>
Ku… as I thought, that Lizard Woman was a dragon.<br/>
And she said she was an emperor like Gaelion.<br/>
"Fi…ro" (Naofumi)<br/>
I desperately let out my voice, and call out to Firo.<br/>
"Leave it to me." (Firo)<br/>
Firo keeps running as she begins casting magic as well.<br/>
「Sanctuary」! (Firo)<br/>
"Nope, 「Bird Sanctuary」!"<br/>
Ku… the Gryphon-like one chants too.<br/>
The moment one’s nullified, another is deployed.<br/>
There’s no way we can use it.<br/>
If we do get to Portal, well need to select the members to evacuate as well.<br/>
In the brief moment when the field is nullified, it’ll be hard to use the skill.<br/>
The front line is also starting to get noisy.<br/>
We’re met by soldiers ahead.<br/>
「Gravity Blade」!<br/>
「Brionac」!<br/>
「Piercing Shot」!<br/>
By the sound of it, the standard soldiers aren’t particularly strong.<br/>
It seems that only a fraction of their forces have broken the level cap.<br/>
It’s safe to assume that all the women we met in that area have received the ability to do so.<br/>
But the support fire coming at us from the rear is troublesome.<br/>
"Acho!"<br/>
"Hah!"<br/>
"Tei!"<br/>
The Granny, Raphtalia, and Fohl concentrate their chi on a single point and stop the bullets in midair. But, it seems that it drains a lot of stamina.<br/>
"Again." (Taniko)<br/>
Taniko rides on Gaelion and assists him in casting a spell.<br/>
It looks like Sadina is helping as well.<br/>
"Uu… Woof!" (Kiel)<br/>
Kiel changes to Kielberus and bites at the soldiers up front.<br/>
But it seems the soldiers aren’t to be laughed at. Or maybe it’s because My Shield was stolen. Anyways, she’s not able to inflict any serious injuries.<br/>
Because the Shield’s gone, the Ability Correction skill isn’t in effect.<br/>
And because of that, Faubley’s soldiers won’t fall so easily…?<br/>
No, even if there’s something rotten in Faubley, it’s the most powerful country. They’re probably elite soldiers with relatively high levels.<br/>
We can’t crush them one-sidedly.<br/>
Luckily, they’re much weaker than Tact’s harem.<br/>
They’re at most level 100.<br/>
Of course, those women are coming at us from behind as well.<br/>
If Tact uses that skill that breached through my defenses, we won’t get away unharmed.<br/>
I think it’s probably on cooldown, or perhaps he doesn’t want to damage his own castle too much.<br/>
"Have you dispelled their anti-teleport field yet!?" (Ren)<br/>
"I’m trying!" (Firo)<br/>
Firo impatiently answers<br/>
"Ren, don’t worry about us! Anything is better than letting those fiends get their hands on another legendary weapon! Just think about yourself and run!" (Female Knight)<br/>
"As if I could do that!" (Ren)<br/>
Ren quickly refutes Female Knight’s words.<br/>
Damn… If we can’t teleport, I guess we get irritated.<br/>
I can’t move, and my consciousness is hazy, so I can only think and observe.<br/>
"If we could just get outside, we could escape on Gaelion, but…" (Itsuki)<br/>
"They probably have something ready to intercept us." (Ren)<br/>
"Father-in-Law!" (Motoyasu)<br/>
Motoyasu runs up to my bloodstained body.<br/>
If you have time to talk to me, go fight!<br/>
We continue our escape, but soldiers block our path, and eventually, we’re led to a dead end.<br/>
「Meteor Sword」!<br/>
We break the wall, and run down the corridor beyond.<br/>
Ren’s ability to take action is worthy of praise.<br/>
"Leave the rear guard to me. Saint-sama, quickly run away!" (Granny)<br/>
Granny takes Raphtalia, Fohl, and Female Knight. In order to stop those pursuing us, they stay behind.<br/>
"No…" (Naofumi)<br/>
I reach out my hand.<br/>
That role is the one I’m supposed to be filling.<br/>
"Naofumi-sama, leave it to me!" (Raphtalia)<br/>
But as if they had expected this, the ones who kinda stood out–the red hooded woman, and the Aotatsu woman–are standing in front of us.<br/>
"As Tact-sama said, you came here."<br/>
"Ku…"<br/>
As I look around, I see more of the people who were around the throne.<br/>
"Kyua!"<br/>
Gaelion deploys his second sanctuary.<br/>
"It’s useless."<br/>
The enemy Dragon merely deploys her’s too.<br/>
It’ll just be an infinite loop.<br/>
Even so, we’ll have to teleport if we want any hope of escape.<br/>
The castle is crawling with enemy forces, and even if we reach the gate, this is their country… the civilians may even raise their arms against us.<br/>
If it was me, that’s what I would do.<br/>
Regardless of where we go, the Hero of the Whip is sure to follow.<br/>
Since we’ve already suffered injury and loss, we have no way to defend ourselves.<br/>
「Sanctuary」!<br/>
「Bird Sanctuary」!<br/>
"Bu-!" (Firo)<br/>
Firo stomps her foot, and impatiently cries out.<br/>
「I who… source… gufu」<br/>
I try to chant magic, but the wounds from Tact are deep, and I can’t concentrate.<br/>
That attack… no, that weapon must be cursed.<br/>
My wounds won’t heal with magic.<br/>
As if he cast a negative status effect, I can’t hold onto my conscience.<br/>
"Master!" (Firo)<br/>
Firo calls out to me, who had just failed in casting magic.<br/>
I can hear Tact shouting from the rear, where Raphtalia and the Granny are fighting.<br/>
"Just give up already, you trash." (Tact)<br/>
"Ku… who the hell would give up! You were tempted by that Witch, you intentionally stepped into our fight with Houou, and everyone… You even killed the Seven Star Heroes!" (Ren)<br/>
Ren prepares himself to bear the brunt of Tact’s advance and declares as such.<br/>
"No matter what, the ones who handed Malty to that pig and revived the Spirit Turtle have no Justice. Just lay down quietly and die!" (Tact)<br/>
Tact readies his claw to strike, and…<br/>
"RAFU~~~~~~~~~~~!" (Raph-chan)<br/>
I feel the anti-teleport field dispel all at once.<br/>
Raph-chan’s tail expands greatly, and she releases magic.<br/>
"Wha-"<br/>
The unexpected development creates an opening.<br/>
They probably thought that since Firo and Gaelion had already deployed their sanctuaries, they would be safe for a while.<br/>
But Raph-chan was an anomaly. Because of him, the heroes were able to use their transfer skills.<br/>
"Now!"<br/>
Ren, Motoyasu, and Itsuki clench their weapons and chant their skills.<br/>
「Transfer Sword」!<br/>
「Portal Spear」!<br/>
「Transfer Bow」!<br/>
"You’re not going anywhere!" (Tact)<br/>
Tact finally takes out a whip.<br/>
And he swings it at Granny, Raphtalia, and Fohl, who were in the rear.<br/>
「Bind Whip」!<br/>
The whip expands as if it were a live snake. It thrusts forwards as if to intertwine itself around Fohl.<br/>
"I won’t let you!" (Raphtalia)<br/>
Sword meets Whip. Raphtalia halts the Whip’s advance.<br/>
"Firo, Fohl-kun, Eclaire-san." (Raphtalia)<br/>
"Aneki…" (Fohl)<br/>
"Raphtalia…" (Female Knight)<br/>
"If something happens to me… I leave Naofumi-sama to you." (Raphtalia)<br/>
Yes, as if she was fully aware of her fate, Raphtalia speaks to Fohl. She smiles at me, who can do nothing but watch.<br/>
"Ra…ph…a"<br/>
When I try to speak, I hear an ominous sound from my lungs.<br/>
Move. Or else… I don’t want to lose anything else! Quickly, dammit!<br/>
"There’s no need for that, Saint-sama!" (Granny)<br/>
"Eh?"<br/>
The Granny kicks Raphtlaia away, and sends her flying at me.<br/>
Raphtalia rolls on the ground dumbfounded.<br/>
"Run away quickly!" (Granny)<br/>
"But we don’t know if the Transfer will-" (Ren)<br/>
"If you don’t do anything, you’ll all die! Now, quickly!" (Granny)<br/>
Ren quickly nods at the Granny’s words, and activates his skill.<br/>
"Saint-sama… I’m leaving the world, and everyone, to you and my disciples!" (Granny)<br/>
"W-what are…"<br/>
"My style existed to make one stronger and to punish evil. Even if my body were to crumble, as long as I know there are ones to carry it on, then my life was not wasted!" (Granny)<br/>
She declares that as she runs in the opposite direction from us.<br/>
"MASTEEEEEEER!"<br/>
Raphtalia, and Rishia, Female Knight, and Fohl’s screams echoed.<br/>
After that, the scenery in front of my eyes changes, and at the same time, for me, the world gets darker and farther away.<br/>
I bet the transfer was successful.<br/>
The same goes for Motoyasu and Itsuki.<br/>
But… The Granny didn’t come with us. We were only able to confirm that after we warped away…<br/>
