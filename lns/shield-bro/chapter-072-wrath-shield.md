Chapter 72<br/>
Wrath Shield<br/>
"Meteor Sword!"<br/>
"Meteor Bow!"<br/>
Ren and Itsuki’s prided Meteor Series attacks are fired at the pope, but the pope is covered by another barrier, keeping a cool face while wielding the replica spear.<br/>
Ren and Itsuki’s companions also use their skills and magic, however the barrier is deployed again so nothing comes close to harming the pope.<br/>
"As expected of imposters, you only have this degree of strength."<br/>
"Damn……"<br/>
"This is harsh. To think he would have such a hidden-card to play."<br/>
"What did you guys even come for?!"<br/>
Even with these guys our chance of success is still almost nil.<br/>
"Do you guys even have any plan in mind?’<br/>
"Just how much long do you plan on making fun of us?"<br/>
Ren and Itsuki’s weapons start to glow, but this time they charge up their energy before attacking.<br/>
"Thunder Slash!"<br/>
"Thunder Shot!"<br/>
The pope looks startled and his eyes open wide as he receives the attack, his barrier creaking.<br/>
"It’s too late! I’ve already bought enough time!"<br/>
The barrier was destroyed due to my Self-Burning Curse last time, and Motoyasu and the rotten heroes were also able to break through it this time.<br/>
"I could still fight…… But I’m out of SP."<br/>
"That’s just the whining of a loser."<br/>
I haven’t helped them so far because I did not expect them have such strong skills.<br/>
Is it too late to jump in? Have I been too cautious?<br/>
"Fufufu…… foolish heroes. Did you truly think you could beat me, the wielder of the legendary weapon?"<br/>
The believers immediately use recovery magic on the Pope to heal him.<br/>
This is troubling. The attack that took so much effort to land was healed in one go.<br/>
"If the others help suppress you, I’ll defeat you. It is my duty as a hero."<br/>
"Everyone. The aria of judgement will now commence."<br/>
The pope’s believers nod and begin to recite magic.<br/>
"All of the imposters and their companions are evil."<br/>
Wow. Quite fanatic.<br/>
I’m not sure we can win this fight even if the reinforcements that Ren and Itsuki called show up.<br/>
"Now then, shall we finish this?"<br/>
The pope is going to seriously kill us. Brionac has been ready for a while and now he charges at us.<br/>
"Naofumi"<br/>
"What?"<br/>
Ren approaches me and asks.<br/>
"Let’s combine our power and beat this guy."<br/>
"Honestly, co-operating with you guys is far too unpleasant."<br/>
It’s impossible to successfully escape.<br/>
Furthermore, if they use the spell, "Judgement," again, I don’t think that I can endure it.<br/>
"Someone must attack me with hostility, and then I must get in close proximity of the pope. After that, get away from me – my attack will affect anyone in range."<br/>
The only effective weapon I have is Self-Burning Curse. If it comes to close range I should somehow manage.<br/>
"I understand."<br/>
"Then, what are you waiting for!?"<br/>
I cast support magic on everyone and issue instructions, preparing myself to protect those who will attack with close combat from both physical and magical damage.<br/>
The heroes attack, supported by magic, their defence buffed, in an unexpectedly organized formation.<br/>
"Let’s go!"<br/>
We rush towards the pope first.<br/>
The pope is ignoring us and concentrating on his skill.<br/>
The only way for me to deal a decisive blow is to receive a hit myself.<br/>
Since I regularly develop my defence, this skill requires a lot of damage to activate.<br/>
"Naofumi!"<br/>
Motoyasu’s spear hits my shield, activating Self-Burning Curse.<br/>
"Uoooooooooooooooooo!"<br/>
The believers not singing the Aria of Judgement try to purify the flames, but of the barrier shatters anyway.<br/>
Immediately I cast Air Strike Shield and Change Shield, then use Hook to withdraw behind the other heroes. Hook’s special effect lets me manipulate it however I want, so I tie it around my arm and use it as an anchor.<br/>
"Thunder Slash!"<br/>
"Lightening Spear!"<br/>
"Thunder Shot!"<br/>
The other heroes use their strongest skills against the pope.<br/>
"Brionac!"<br/>
However, the pope counters with his skill!<br/>
The Pope’s skill and the heroes skills clash against each other, and the two side’s conflicting energies fill the air with the electric crackling.<br/>
"Goooooooooooooo!"<br/>
"Yooooooooooooou!"<br/>
"Deryaaaaaaaaaaaaa!"<br/>
I am reminded of an old anime where two beams collide and fight for superiority in both offence and defense.<br/>
(Tl note: KAMEHAMEHAAAAAAAAA)(Ed note: AVADAAA KEDAVRAAAAAAAA)<br/>
The heroes’ companions are also support them with magic, pushing the pope back little by little.<br/>
Or so I thought……<br/>
"Fufu……Is that it?"<br/>
The pope’s smile remains undiminished.<br/>
No way! He was holding back!?<br/>
"No…… Not yet! I will not be defeated yet!"<br/>
"That’s right! We can still fight!"<br/>
"Yeah, let’s raise the output!"<br/>
The three of them use all their SP on their skills.<br/>
Though it’s just a little I’ll try to help too.<br/>
But… I cannot rid myself of the ominous feeling that something is wrong.<br/>
"Now then, shall we end this soon?" The pope murmurs indifferently, increasing his power.<br/>
Shit! If we die here it would be troublesome!<br/>
I mean, I wanted this the other’s to die, but the timing right now is terrible……<br/>
I push away the Heroes to stop their skills and step forward.<br/>
I almost can’t withstand the pain as energy passes through my body, but I hold out my shield and endure it desperately.<br/>
After what seems an age, the energy dissipates.<br/>
"Haa….. haa……"<br/>
"Interesting…… I did not expect the Devil of the Shield to be able to withstand that." The pope declares quietly, swinging the spear around.<br/>
"A-Are you okay?"<br/>
I look back, but all I can see is a blur.<br/>
Everything except for a small area behind me was completely destroyed.<br/>
Fortunately, I did not receive too much damage, thanks to those supporting me from behind.<br/>
""Tzuvait ・Heal!""<br/>
My wounds were immediately healed thanks to the recovery magic.<br/>
If the other three heroes hadn’t reduced that attack’s power with their skills, I would have died.<br/>
"Damn……Our SP……"<br/>
"Me too."<br/>
"Same here."<br/>
I give the three of them SP recovery potions.<br/>
We probably won’t have enough time to completely recover though.<br/>
I suddenly hear a loud war cry. It seems the reinforcements that Ren called have arrived.<br/>
"Now then, I have had enough of this farce with the devil. I shall dispose of all of you and summon the true heroes. But first, why don’t I keep those people occupied for now."<br/>
The pope changes the spear into a sword and takes up a stance.<br/>
The sword blade’s shape takes on the semblance of a phoenix.<br/>
Perhaps this skill is even more superior to Brionac.<br/>
Dangerous…… those guys from the punitive force have no idea that the Pope has something like this up his sleeve.<br/>
There is the possibility they will all be wiped out at once.<br/>
"Everyone, Let’s provide judgment together."<br/>
He intends to attack together with his subordinates. Although only a bit, we have gained some time.<br/>
"So we could only come this far……"<br/>
The other heroes are all pale.<br/>
No matter how reckless we act, our chances of success are low……<br/>
No, wasn’t it also like this against Motoyasu? Can I say that I did my best?<br/>
Did I do my best…?<br/>
Suddenly, it comes to me.<br/>
It’s a desperate gamble, but we’re dead anyway. We might as well give it all we have.<br/>
"Ren, come here for a moment."<br/>
"What’s up? Do you have a plan?"<br/>
After I tell Ren to approach, he does so suspiciously.<br/>
Dokun, Dokun. (Sfx: Pulsing)<br/>
The shield’s pulsing strengthens, and it begins to vibrate.<br/>
I was intentionally sealing off the dragon core’s rage towards Ren up until now.<br/>
The memory is being projected in my vision again, and the shield wants to slaughter the enemy before me.<br/>
That’s right….. More… Give me more anger!<br/>
Thanks to Raphtalia, I can control the massive amount of rage pouring from the Shield of Anger.<br/>
"Raphtalia, your hand……"<br/>
"Okay"<br/>
I join hands with Raphtalia and point my shield at Ren.<br/>
I look at Motoyasu and the Bitch to remind myself of the anger that I wanted to avoid.<br/>
All the hatred, and everything else is forgotten, all that is left pitch-blackness and anger.<br/>
Grow Up has been achieved due to released emotions.<br/>
Curse Series: Ability improvement of the Shield of Anger! Shield of Anger changed to Wrath Shield!<br/>
Wrath Shield 3<br/>
Ability Unsealed….. Equipment Bonus: Skill [Change Shield (Attack)] [Iron Maiden] [Blutopfer]<br/>
(Tl note: Blutopfer means Blood Sacrifice in German.)<br/>
Special Effect: Dark Curse Burning Physical, Strength Up, Roar of the angry Dragon, Roar, Frenzy of Companions, Magic Sharing, Clothes of Anger (Intermediate)<br/>
Instantly my heart is consumed by dark emotions.<br/>
"——————–!"<br/>
