Fat. Fucking. Bird. <br/>
Chapter 65 <br/>
 <br/>
Legend of the Holy Bird <br/>
 <br/>
Several days after changing the way I address the second princess to Melty. <br/>
We have been making considerable progress in the opposite direction of Silt Welt thanks to Firo. <br/>
 <br/>
Setting that aside. <br/>
Recently we have been encountering a lot of wild Philo Rials. <br/>
At night their calls remind me of howling wolves in the distance, it is very annoying, especially in the middle of the night. <br/>
Is there a Philo Rial habitat around here? <br/>
 <br/>
I wonder while sleeping. <br/>
It was midnight when and I was sleeping when suddenly. <br/>
 <br/>
"""Gua~!""" <br/>
"Firo, shut up." <br/>
"It's not Firo." <br/>
 <br/>
That was fairly close to us though, if it wasn't Firo then what was it? <br/>
Are there more wild Philo Rials? <br/>
 <br/>
"Umm......Naofumi-sama? I heard a lot of Philo Rial cries." <br/>
 <br/>
I notice another cry, and this one is quite near. <br/>
 <br/>
"Thanks for reminding me. Firo, do you know how many there are?" <br/>
"I don't know." <br/>
"Are they far off?" <br/>
"Well, They are coming." <br/>
"What?" <br/>
 <br/>
We look at Firo with strained expressions. <br/>
 <br/>
"Be cautious." <br/>
"Everyone said they are coming to meet with Firo ." <br/>
"Are they speaking to you with this cry!?" <br/>
"Yep." <br/>
 <br/>
She nodded. I feel uneasy at large amount of Philo Rial cries that could be heard. <br/>
The bushes all around us start shaking, and silhouettes of Philo Rials could be seen. <br/>
 <br/>
"What the hell is going on!?" <br/>
"Waa......There are so many Philo Rial!" <br/>
 <br/>
Melty's eyes start to shine as she watches the Philo Rial. <br/>
 <br/>
"Umm, Melty. Listen well because I'll teach you something important." <br/>
"What is it?" <br/>
"Philo Rials eat everything. Firo and I may be alirght, but if these Philo Rial attack, you and Raphtalia will be eaten." <br/>
"What are you saying Naofumi. Philo Rials are gentle demons. There is no way they would do something like that." <br/>
 <br/>
It's hard to keep a straight face after all that. <br/>
 <br/>
"Shit...... I can't get to the neighbouring country to meet the queen,if joke-like developments with wild demons happen." <br/>
 <br/>
The Philo Rials stop hiding and surround us. <br/>
There are way too many to count. <br/>
A bunch of Philo Rial eyes glowing in the darkness too. <br/>
There are Philo Rial as far as the eye can see. <br/>
The on earth is happening? <br/>
 <br/>
Maybe this is a territorial despite between Philo Rial. <br/>
But Firo shouldn't be able to understand the concept of territory. <br/>
Firo may be recognized as an extremely high ranked Philo Rial, did they come thinking of her as a menace? <br/>
However, since Firo didn't give us a warning cry, this may be different. <br/>
Or rather...... Did they come to scout Firo into their territory? <br/>
There is a possibility that is happening. <br/>
Alright, let's go with that. <br/>
 <br/>
"Firo, I hope you find happiness with these guys." <br/>
"What are you saying suddenly,Naofumi-sama!" <br/>
"Firo-chan is going to leave!?" <br/>
"We can't help it. These guys came to pick up Firo." <br/>
"Really!?" <br/>
"Separating from Master? No~!" <br/>
 <br/>
Firo, don't you understand the situation? <br/>
It's already too late. If we don't give up Firo here we'll be mobbed by a large amount of Philo Rials. <br/>
 <br/>
"Do your best for us, for these guys. Firo." <br/>
 <br/>
After this situation is solved I'll have to go buy a new Philo Rial. I hope the next one won't be so annoying. <br/>
 <br/>
"No~!" <br/>
 <br/>
While we were bantering. <br/>
 <br/>
"""Gua~!""" <br/>
 <br/>
A group of Philo Rials just to divided into two like that one scene from Moses and the Ten Commandments. <br/>
what the hell? <br/>
 <br/>
"Gua~!" <br/>
 <br/>
One Philo Rial walks leisurely towards us. It is also pulling some luxurious carriage. <br/>
...... There are jewels fitted onto that carriage. <br/>
I think I've seen some of those jewels before......Where was it? <br/>
I suddenly look at the shield. <br/>
There is a jewel that looks the same as those on the carriage. <br/>
 <br/>
"""Gua!""" <br/>
 <br/>
A group of Philo Rials salute and bows towards the Philo Rial that is pulling the carriage. <br/>
Rattlerattle, the Philo Rial pulling the carriage stops before us. <br/>
 <br/>
"Wow...... that is cool. I'm jealous!" <br/>
 <br/>
Firo's eyes are sparkling as she watches the carriage. <br/>
I hate it. It's such an upstart carriage. <br/>
If I had the choice, I would rather not ride something like that. <br/>
 <br/>
"Gua!" <br/>
 <br/>
The rope that tied the Philo Rial to the wagon comes off and it steps forward. <br/>
Another Philo Rial walks up to the rear. <br/>
 <br/>
"What's that? What's going to happen?" <br/>
"Gueeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeee!" <br/>
 <br/>
When the Philo Rial surrounding the carriage calls out, the surrounding plants start glowing green and wind arises. <br/>
 <br/>
"Ah......did they put up a barrier!?" <br/>
"Barrier?" <br/>
 <br/>
Melty's voice is full of surprise. <br/>
 <br/>
"Yes. Naofumi, doesn't it look brighter? From a distance all you would see is fog." <br/>
 <br/>
I pay more attention to the group of Philo Rials. <br/>
There doesn't seem to be anything like a dense fog. <br/>
 <br/>
"This is a high-class sanctuary type barrier." <br/>
"What's that?" <br/>
"There is a Forest of Illusion, according to legends, equipment of the old era heroes are said to be kept there; However, the fog of magic prevents all who approach." <br/>
"You know quite a lot." <br/>
"Mother likes stories about the Forest of Illusion. This fog resembles the one described in the stories. I'm surprised." <br/>
 <br/>
Does that mean? We can't escape from here even if we run? <br/>
 <br/>
"Will you be able to return if you enter the fog?......We seem to have set foot inside the sanctuary of Philo Rials." <br/>
 <br/>
Melty seems totally entranced. <br/>
That reminds me, this fellow loves Philo Rials. Isn't this like a dream come true? <br/>
 <br/>
"Now's not the time for this!" <br/>
 <br/>
The plants shine until it's as bright as day. <br/>
What on earth is happening? <br/>
The Philo Rial that pulled the carriage starts to swell up, up the point where it's just a black silhouette. <br/>
Huge...... <br/>
The silhouette swells flabbily. There is probably a big chance that Firo will end up like that. <br/>
At first it had the appearance of a normal Philo Rial, but now it's 6 meters tall. <br/>
And...... it stops expanding when it reaches 9 meters. This figure is the same as Firo's demon form.  <br/>
The same as Philo Rial · Queen  (Temporary)  <br/>
(Tl note: フィロリアル・クイーン(仮) not sure why there is a temp in the raws.) <br/>
 <br/>
"Wow~......Big" <br/>
 <br/>
I mutter, and Melty looks like she cannot contain her excitement. <br/>
Compared to Firo's colour which is light pink and white, that Philo Rial · Queen is white and azure. <br/>
A big difference would be a wing-like crown on top of it's head that Firo doesn't have. <br/>
 <br/>
"Kueeeeeeeee!" <br/>
 <br/>
With just it's voice, The vibrations could be felt to the bones. <br/>
 <br/>
"Yes.Yes. I understand." <br/>
 <br/>
Firo nods a few times and turns to us. <br/>
 <br/>
"Umm you see. It seems visiting in human form is impolite. she says." <br/>
 <br/>
Firo translates the words that it says. Oh, is it natural that you can communicate since you are from the same race? <br/>
 <br/>
"Because there is an ancient pledge and oath, I cannot speak with people easily. I hope you understand. She says." <br/>
"......Well, that's fine. But what business do you have with us?" <br/>
"Kueeeeeee!" <br/>
"First let's have some self-introduction. I am the Queen of Philo Rials. My old name is Fitoria. She says." <br/>
"Fitoria!? That's the name of the Philo Rial from the legends." <br/>
 <br/>
Meltly yells with an expression full of astonishment. <br/>
 <br/>
"Are you by any chance the Hero of the Shield? She says." <br/>
"Ah, yeah......" <br/>
"I apologize for the sudden visit. I have a little business here. She says." <br/>
"Wh-what would that be?" <br/>
 <br/>
I have a pain in my neck from looking up at the big Philo Rial. <br/>
 <br/>
"Kueee" <br/>
"Eh......No~" <br/>
 <br/>
Firo gives her a dirty look. What are they talking about? <br/>
 <br/>
"Kueee!" <br/>
"Really!? All right. I understand." <br/>
"What did you talk about?" <br/>
"Umm you see. She wants to know Firo's ability , and she seems to want to fight Firo." <br/>
"Just Firo?" <br/>
 <br/>
Fitoria nods at my question. <br/>
 <br/>
"You see. I think we will have a good fight." <br/>
"Are you going to avoid killing each other?" <br/>
 <br/>
Fitoria nodded again. Although I was busy trying to meet the queen...... A different queen shows up. <br/>
 <br/>
"......Isn't it fine then?" <br/>
"Kueeeee" <br/>
"Thank you for listening to my request Hero of the Shield. She says." <br/>
 <br/>
What a troublesome conversation. you should talk from the start if you are capable of it. <br/>
The Philo Rials surrounding us backs up when Fitoria expands her wings. <br/>
 <br/>
"Kueeee" <br/>
"Hero's party should fall back too. She says." <br/>
"Okay okay." <br/>
 <br/>
Raphtalia, Melty, and I went to the edge of the circle made by Philo Rials. <br/>
 <br/>
"Kueeeeeee!" <br/>
"Here I go~" <br/>
 <br/>
Firo returns to her demon form and charges at Fitoria.
