SS: Christmas<br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
Funfunfu~ Funfunfu~ Funfunfun, fu, fu~<br/>
<br/>
"Arisa is disgusting nodesu."<br/>
"Are you awright~?"<br/>
<br/>
Mumumu, how rude!<br/>
<br/>
"I'm just preparing for Christmas."<br/>
"Kuisuasu?"<br/>
"Is it fun nodesu?"<br/>
<br/>
Gununu. Unpleasant memories from the past comes into my mind.... Calm down Arisa. Today you're having a Christmas with your beloved person aren't you. Although it's not just the two of us, the god of fortune rarely ever gives this much service for me, so I have to enjoy it.<br/>
<br/>
"It's fun you know. You eat on a feast, and everyone plays together."<br/>
"Like usual~?"<br/>
"Everyday is a Christmas nano desu!"<br/>
<br/>
No, that is true, but it's different.<br/>
Kuh, the magic of bullet list is obstructing me!<br/>
<br/>
"During the Christmas, a person wearing red clothes called Santa-san delivers presents."<br/>
"Purezento~?"<br/>
"Something like a gift."<br/>
"Meat nanodesu?!<br/>
"Whale karaage is nice nodesu!"<br/>
<br/>
Ah~, that was delicious~<br/>
Oops, I've been taken in by these two's paces.<br/>
If it stay like this, I won't make it in time to prepare the Santa cosplay.<br/>
Alright, let's kill two birds with one stone.<br/>
<br/>
"However, you see, only good kids receive the presents."<br/>
"Tama is a good kid~"<br/>
"Pochi is also a good kid nanodesu!"<br/>
"Ara, is that really so? Even if you think yourself a good kid, other people might not think the same you know?"<br/>
"Unyu~"<br/>
"I, it's not like that!　Arisa is mean nanodesu!"<br/>
"Bad kids, you see"<br/>
<br/>
I cut my words, and attract the two's attentions.<br/>
<br/>
"Black Namahage wearing bla~ck clothes will come"<br/>
<br/>
I gradually lower my voice for the play.<br/>
Waiting for when the two hold their breath.<br/>
<br/>
"Are there bad kidds here~!!"<br/>
"No bad kid~!"<br/>
"Pochi and Tama are good kids nanodesu~~"<br/>
<br/>
I shouted loudly while raising both my hands, and the two went downstairs while screaming toward the room where master and the others are.<br/>
Yep, they're good kids who are worth to tease at.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
◇<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
As an apology for scaring them at the daytime, I present Pochi and Tama with socks.<br/>
When I teach them that they will get presents from Santa-san if they leave it on their bedsides, they hang the socks while looking really happy.<br/>
Mia is also hanging the over-the-kneesocks that she usually wears, but those are thin, so they'll stretch if you put presents into it you know?<br/>
<br/>
The four people are lying on the bed, and sleep happily.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
◇<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
"Ara? It seems Arisa has also fallen asleep."<br/>
"Then, let's put the presents and go back."<br/>
"Yes."<br/>
<br/>
So Arisa won't participate in the Christmas night performance.<br/>
Even though I've prepared a magic tools that play moody music, Hors D'oeuvre, and adult-like tablewares, unfortunately.<br/>
<br/>
While healing myself by looking at the four who sleep happily, I quietly close the bedroom door.<br/>
<br/>
<TLN: This whole last part are Satou's.><br/>
