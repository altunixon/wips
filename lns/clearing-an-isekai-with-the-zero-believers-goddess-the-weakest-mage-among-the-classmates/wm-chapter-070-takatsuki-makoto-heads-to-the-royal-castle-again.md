<br/>
"Well then, it is about time we go to the Sun Country, Highland." (Makoto)<br/>
I proposed this to everyone in the evening.<br/>
There’s no reason to stay here for long anyways.<br/>
"Because there are no goblins?" (Lucy)<br/>
Lucy says this, peeking upwards at my face.<br/>
I avert my face.<br/>
"There are too few Spirits here and it doesn’t help out in my training." (Makoto)<br/>
Well, there being no monsters around is also a big factor though.<br/>
It is boring.<br/>
"I’m fine with that." (Aya)<br/>
Sa-san agrees with me while fiddling with her hair.<br/>
Sa-san knocked down all the knights, so it gets pretty awkward between them.<br/>
You meet the patrolling knights walking around the city pretty often.<br/>
"Then, it would be best to go to the castle to report this." (Fujiwara)<br/>
Fuji-yan warns me.<br/>
Is that how it works?<br/>
"I will go give my greetings at the royal castle then." (Chris)<br/>
Seems like Chris-san will be going.<br/>
"Chris-sama, want me to accompany you?" (Nina)<br/>
"Nina, I told you not to add ‘-sama’. Now, let’s go." (Chris)<br/>
"Yes, Chris. I will go get ready first." (Nina)<br/>
Hm, Nina-san and Chris-san are getting along better than ever before.<br/>
What was the prickly atmosphere of just a few days ago?<br/>
We prepared to depart, and waited for Chris-san and Nina-san to return.<br/>
◇◇<br/>
 "…I told them that we will be departing to the Sun Country, and they told me that they want to hold a dinner together with us, so come tonight to the Rozes Castle, is the message I was given." (Chris)<br/>
Chris-san returned with a troubled expression.<br/>
"Are they trying to stop us…?" (Fujiwara)<br/>
Fuji-yan mutters.<br/>
"Do we have to go…?" (Makoto)<br/>
"Ma-ko-to." (Lucy)<br/>
Lucy shakes her head to the sides.<br/>
Yeah, I should know already.<br/>
This is a forced event.<br/>
"Will there be a lot of delicious food?" (Aya)<br/>
Sa-san seems to be looking forward to it, different from everyone else. <br/>
"The royal cuisine of the Water Country is said to be of high level." (Nina)<br/>
Ah, Nina-san seems to be in that band too.<br/>
The girls that like eating.<br/>
With all that said, we head to the Rozes Castle once again.<br/>
◇◇<br/>
"Waah, so tasty~." <br/>
"This is a delicacy!" <br/>
I underestimated the cooking of the Rozes royalty.<br/>
It is crazy delicious.<br/>
That’s a touristic country’s capital for ya.<br/>
A steak that I can cut with chopsticks, a platter of sashimi that was prepared from a whole fish that’s as big as a skipjack tuna (and there’s something similar to soy sauce!).<br/>
Crab, prawn, vegetable tempura, and the many fresh types of salads.<br/>
The fact that there’s quite a lot of japanese-like food here bothers me though.<br/>
…No, this was probably done to match our taste.<br/>
"Hey, Takatsuki-kun! The sweets corner over there is amazing!" (Aya)<br/>
"Alright! Let’s go!" (Makoto)<br/>
It is a buffet, so we can take as much as we want, and Sa-san is all merry.<br/>
Me too.<br/>
Man, I am glad we came.<br/>
"Makoto-san, how is it? Did the food of the Rozes Castle meet your taste?" <br/>
Prince Leonard.<br/>
I prop myself up so to not be rude.<br/>
It worries me that Sa-san is chugging down wine at the back.<br/>
Must not make a blunder.<br/>
"This is the first time I’ve had such delicious food." (Makoto)<br/>
This isn’t flattery, I really think so.<br/>
"This dinner was something that I asked Nee-sama to open. I wanted to talk with Makoto-san one more time." (Leonard)<br/>
Looking at me with those glittering eyes is embarrassing me.<br/>
"Can you show me your magic one more time?" (Leonard)<br/>
"Uhm…right. Then, over here." (Makoto)<br/>
I can’t be stingy when showing magic for the Prince.<br/>
We come close to the fountain that is at the castle’s garden.<br/>
(Uhm, Water Magic: [Dance of Animals]!) (Makoto)<br/>
Using the water of the fountain, I create mermaids, birds, horses, and other animal forms at random, and have them dance.<br/>
It is like a water show.<br/>
The people that were doing a musical performance at the party venue began to play their instruments to match this.<br/>
There’s few Spirits, but as expected of the fountain of the royal castle, it is good water that has mana in it.<br/>
It reminds me of the Water Temple.<br/>
Now that I think about it, this is technically the head temple of the Water Temples.<br/>
"W-Wow! Just how much do you have to train to master water magic to this extent!" (Leonard)<br/>
Looks like Prince Leonard is enjoying this.<br/>
That’s a relief.<br/>
"Hey hey, Makoto, what’s your water magic proficiency now?" (Lucy)<br/>
Lucy pokes my cheek with champagne in one hand.<br/>
The red dress that reveals her shoulders suits her.<br/>
The fact that she can mix well even in places like this is just like her.<br/>
"More than 150." (Makoto)<br/>
I whisper it to her.<br/>
The Soul Book modification is against the law, so I can’t say it out loud.<br/>
The official number of my Water Magic Proficiency is 99.<br/>
Lucy moans with a low ‘hau!’.<br/>
"I-I am still at 30…" (Lucy)<br/>
"No, the first time you weren’t even at 10, you know." (Makoto)<br/>
You have grown.<br/>
It seems like Proficiency tends to increase more quickly with weak Magic Skill.<br/>
To increase Proficiency, it is needed to increase the amount of times you use magic.<br/>
But when it is someone like Lucy who is a Monarch Mage, just using 1 spell is already hard.<br/>
Because she has to control an astounding amount of mana every time.<br/>
In that point, someone like me who is an Apprentice Mage with my pathetic amount of mana, I can easily…saying it myself is already making me sad.<br/>
"Makoto-san! Can you teach me magic?!" (Leonard)<br/>
Prince Leonard asks me with clear eyes.<br/>
Oh, that’s unexpected.<br/>
[Will you accept the request of Prince Leonard?]<br/>
Yes<br/>
No ←<br/>
It has been a while since I have gotten the choices.<br/>
What to do…<br/>
If I choose [Yes], I would have to stay in Horun for a while.<br/>
If I choose [No]…in the first place, is it okay to refuse the request of the Prince?<br/>
I don’t hate Prince Leonard.<br/>
He is amiable and I can tell that he admires me.<br/>
Just that, his sister Sofia is scary.<br/>
While I was thinking about this…<br/>
"Leo, what are you doing?" <br/>
A refreshing voice resonated from the back.<br/>
◇◇<br/>
 -Princess Sofia POV-<br/>
I set tonight’s dinner at the request of Leo.<br/>
But I can’t understand if Takatsuki Makoto has that much appeal to merit it.<br/>
He is simply a mage that can use water magic decently.<br/>
If it is that much, we have a lot of those in this country.<br/>
"That’s not it, Nee-sama! Can’t you tell the delicate control of Makoto-san’s water magic?! They move like they are alive!" (Leonard)<br/>
Leo speaks passionately, but…good grief.<br/>
Would something like that be useful in the subjugation of the Great Demon Lord?<br/>
That just serves for show.<br/>
Even so, the hero candidates of the parallel world that I had my eyes on all left the country.<br/>
In that regard, it was my blunder.<br/>
The people from the other world have low religious belief towards the Gods.<br/>
Forcing the rules of this country on them without noticing this, was a mistake.<br/>
In that point, Princess Noel from the Sun Country is doing it well.<br/>
She provides them money, land, and even lovers.<br/>
"Sofia, you are going to bring back the Light Hero to Rozes with your beauty!" <br/>
Mother even spread a weird rumor to pull the interest of the Light Hero.<br/>
I’m sure that will prove pointless…<br/>
In the first place, the opponent is the Light Oracle that’s called the Princess that Illuminates the Heavens <Amaterasu>, Princess Noel. <br/>
There’s no way I can win against that.<br/>
Oh my? It seems like Leonard is talking to Takatsuki Makoto.<br/>
I hope he is not putting anything weird in his head.<br/>
"Nee-sama! I am asking Makoto-san if he can teach me magic!" (Leonard)<br/>
"Good evening, Princess Sofia." (Makoto)<br/>
Leo has a wide smile, and Takatsuki Makoto an uncomfortable smile.<br/>
"Leo, he is an adventurer. You must not ask for the unreasonable." (Sofia)<br/>
A prince asking for the magic teachings of an adventurer?<br/>
Moreover, that man is an apprentice mage.<br/>
Just what is he thinking…?<br/>
"Prince Leonard, if you want to learn magic, there should be a whole lot of mages that are more suited than me." (Makoto)<br/>
That’s a good answer that shows you understand your own standing, Takatsuki Makoto.<br/>
"Leo, let’s call for a High Rank Mage of the royal castle later." (Sofia)<br/>
The fact that we don’t even have a Superior Rank Mage is the sad part of our country.<br/>
"That’s not it, Nee-sama! Makoto-san’s water magic is art. It is different from the other people." (Leonard)<br/>
"No, you are putting it way too high." (Makoto)<br/>
"Leo…you can’t defeat monsters and demons with art." (Sofia)<br/>
What’s with this? It is like Takatsuki Makoto and I are cooperating to convince Leo.<br/>
When I was thinking about how to calm him down…<br/>
"Reporting! Monsters have appeared in the city!" <br/>
A loud voice that stopped the party resonated in the venue.<br/>
