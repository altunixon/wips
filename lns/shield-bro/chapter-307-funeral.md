Since Naofumi lost his Wrath, I’ll need to make another header entry contest.<br/>
Chapter 307: Funeral<br/>
The next day.<br/>
After we both tired ourselves out with lamentation, I slept with Raphtalia.<br/>
(TL: No, not like that)<br/>
"These are the heroes that risked their lives to win this battle… Salute!"<br/>
In front of the castle on the land where Houou was sealed, a funeral service was being held.<br/>
Those who were lost in the battle were respectfully buried.<br/>
We had to part with several people from my village as well.<br/>
I raised them to be my pawns for war… but I wanted all of them to return alive.<br/>
Should I… stop deploying them in waves?<br/>
If I’ll have to feel like this every time, then I don’t want to send them into battle.<br/>
I quietly stood in front of Atlas’s casket.<br/>
It’s empty. Her body is… inside my Shield.<br/>
I gently place a flower on top.<br/>
Fohl follows my lead, and places one as well.<br/>
"…"<br/>
For some reason, Trash also silently garnishes the casket with flowers.<br/>
His expression is dark.<br/>
He says nothing to either me or Fohl.<br/>
But I knew.<br/>
When I retreated with Atlas to the back lines, Trash stood outside the tent the entire time.<br/>
Even though he wasn’t able to help at all, what does he plan to do at this point in time!?<br/>
But taking my anger out on Trash won’t accomplish anything.<br/>
Getting angry is pointless. It won’t bring anything.<br/>
… I couldn’t do anything either.<br/>
And I learned that Trash wasn’t the culprit.<br/>
He was with the Queen issuing orders when it happened. Many attested to that.<br/>
More importantly, Trash had little reason to do it.<br/>
Based on Atlas’s positioning, she would have been brought into the explosion regardless, unless I did something about it.<br/>
"… I’m going to fight it. The wave." (Fohl)<br/>
Fohl declares this at me.<br/>
"Running away… will just lead to more of the villagers dying." (Fohl)<br/>
"… I see."<br/>
So that’s Fohl’s answer.<br/>
If I was in his position, I bet I would fight the Waves.<br/>
For everyone’s sake. For Atlas’s sake.<br/>
"Niichan…"<br/>
Kiel is quite worn out. She cries as she places a flower on the coffin.<br/>
"I’ll… fight too!" (Kiel)<br/>
"But-" (Naofumi)<br/>
On hearing my voice, Kiel directs eyes filled with determination at me.<br/>
"Niichan always said it! That it was a fight where we could die, that it wasn’t a game. Everyone was well aware of that when they chose to fight for you! I can’t just pull back because it’s dangerous!" (Kiel)<br/>
"Is what she says." (Fohl)<br/>
Fohl continues after Kiel.<br/>
"Everyone in that village fought out of love for you… Aniki. They decided to fight for you. You can’t stop them anymore. Take… responsibility for what you’ve done." (Fohl)<br/>
"… Got it." (Naofumi)<br/>
But I don’t want to have them die.<br/>
Every time I remember Atlas’s words, my heart shakes.<br/>
What was I making these people do?<br/>
I never thought I was the one who didn’t realize it.<br/>
In order not to have any more regrets, I…<br/>
Raphtalia just silently stands in front of Atlas’s coffin.<br/>
Atlas told me that Raphtalia was in love with me.<br/>
I had pushed it out of my mind. It’s not that I never considered the possibility, but I deluded myself into thinking she was just a diligent child working for me.<br/>
Atlas’s will tightens around my heart.<br/>
I have nothing but regrets. They won’t leave me.<br/>
She once said that she might die any day.<br/>
Then… so I don’t have to feel like this anymore, should I answer those that say they love me?<br/>
What did I do for Atlas?<br/>
I took away her illness, but what else did I ever do for her?<br/>
I should have been able to give her more happiness.<br/>
… I’ll stop it. This train of thought.<br/>
I’ll leave if for after I do what I must. For after I know the world is safe.<br/>
–<br/>
The funeral concludes, and I address the Queen.<br/>
"Though this occasion may have given rise to many sacrifices, I am thankful for your efforts towards destroying Houou, Iwatani-sama." (Queen)<br/>
"Spare me your pleasantries. I just want to see if you’ve identified the bastard who shot that unnecessary attack." (Naofumi)<br/>
"… No, we have heard nothing of the culprit." (Queen)<br/>
"What about the Seven Star Heroes that were supposed to come running here? They’re the greatest suspects." (Naofumi)<br/>
"… I’m truly sorry, but we still have yet to get into contact with them." (Queen)<br/>
"You sure are useless!" (Naofumi)<br/>
I’m getting pissed off.<br/>
I understand the Queen has done nothing wrong, but I can’t do anything about my emotions.<br/>
"Another important matter we have to attend to is the next of the four beasts. What do you think about it?" (Queen)<br/>
"Meaning?" (Naofumi)<br/>
On my question, the Queen lets out a small sound of surprise.<br/>
"Have you not heard from the other heroes about the timing of the next wave?" (Queen)<br/>
I confirm the blue hourglass in my field of vision.<br/>
… 2 Days and 18 Hours.<br/>
Short! We have no time left!<br/>
I’m at a loss for words.<br/>
Oy, oy. The next of the Four Good Omens is… Kirin, was it?<br/>
The place it’s sealed… I never asked anyone!<br/>
"According to the Hero of the Sword-sama, the beast is set to appear around Faubley." (Queen)<br/>
Faubley… Are we going to drag our current forces all the way to Faubley to prepare for it?<br/>
In less than three days?<br/>
If Firo wanted to run straight without and food or rest, I think it would take two days to get to Melromark from here.<br/>
How far away is Faubley?<br/>
"And wait, where was Houou’s blue Hourglass?" (Naofumi)<br/>
"It manifested in the center of the city. According to witness reports, it just glowed blue, and there was no sand, though." (Queen)<br/>
Fumu… a sand less, blue Hourglass appeared.<br/>
That sure sounds strange.<br/>
Houou gave three months of long rest, but Kirin, only three days.<br/>
Both the turtle and the Bird moved to destroy as many life-forms as possible.<br/>
… The Four Good Omens.<br/>
The only answer I can think of right now is that the amount of lives they take extends the time to the next wave.<br/>
Those beasts were supposed to bring happiness and fortune.<br/>
So looking at the world as a whole, is this extension the fortune they bring?<br/>
Sacrifices… thinking about Atlas, and the others, I want to deny the possibility.<br/>
No, I should be denying it.<br/>
It may just be that the seal was going to break now by coincidence.<br/>
But more importantly.<br/>
"What will we do about Kirin? No, I should call Ren." (Naofumi)<br/>
I raise my voice, and call for the Sword.<br/>
After a while, Ren answers my call, and comes towards me.<br/>
"What?" (Ren)<br/>
"What sort of enemy is Kirin?" (Naofumi)<br/>
"A monster on equal footing with Houou." (Ren)<br/>
Kirin… I believe it was a set of two beasts, like Houou. Ki and Rin.<br/>
Is the Kirin sealed in Houou the same one I know of? The ones that would appear before kings of good virtue?<br/>
But Faubley’s under that Pig King, right?<br/>
That really doesn’t seem to be the case.<br/>
Perhaps the first time it manifested, the king was coincidentally a capable one.<br/>
But with only three days to spare, what will we do with the armies?<br/>
They were equipped to travel from the beginning, but there’s no time for weapon maintenance, and war conferences.<br/>
And what’s with this time limit? There’s no time to prepare or anything!<br/>
It isn’t even a distance easily trekked in three days, and even if we wanted to warp there, Motoyasu already erased it from his saved warp locations, so we can’t.<br/>
Is the only option to travel by land?<br/>
Dammit all.<br/>
"At the very least, the heroes should set out. With three days, I’m not sure if even Firo will be able to make it, but we have to go." (Naofumi)<br/>
As it is, it’s a powerful monster.<br/>
Even if we can’t make it, we have to go.<br/>
Faubley is this world’s largest country, so its population should be massive.<br/>
If a monster that hunted life appeared in such a place,what would happen?<br/>
The answer is clear.<br/>
I have to reduce the casualties as much as possible.<br/>
Perhaps… we can beat it with just the Heroes.<br/>
It doesn’t matter if I’m getting full of myself. We can only try.<br/>
If that’s the case, the villagers won’t have to become sacrifices.<br/>
"For now, let’s warp back to the village, and set out." (Naofumi)<br/>
But we took all of the Filo Rials here to assist in the Army’s transportation.<br/>
Do I have to make use of the monsters I turned into Raphs?<br/>
They do have some stamina, but they’re not as fast as Filo Rials.<br/>
"Who should we take?"<br/>
"The Allied Armies have suffered heavy casualties, and moving them will be difficult. Queen, what will you do?"<br/>
"… I understand. I will accompany you with my Trash. I’ll negotiate cooperation with Faubley’s army." (Queen)<br/>
Fumu, she really is Melty’s mother.<br/>
At times like this, she takes the initiative, and steps forward.<br/>
The Queen went to talk to the other army commanders.<br/>
It ended up that the Silt Welt generals would take charge of the Armies, and have them steadily proceed towards Faubley.<br/>
