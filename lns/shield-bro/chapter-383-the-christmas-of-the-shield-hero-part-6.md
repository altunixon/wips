<br/>
Well, this one was done in a bit of a rush, I had a lot of normal academic work to do. I can ensure accuracy, but not quality. All grammatical, or phrasing-related suggestions are considered. Not too interesting of a chapter, it mostly focused on how the other heroes kicked off their Christmas Day. I only have one left before I find something else to occupy my time with. Oh, before I forget, Warning: spoilers, spoilers, lots of spoilers.<br/>
THE CHRISTMAS OF THE SHIELD HERO PART 6<br/>
After that we continually travelled around the village using the flying sled.<br/>
Is this really necessary?<br/>
As I think this, I spot Ren.<br/>
He’s inside of his house. His face is planted on the desk next to his window<br/>
"Jingle bells… Jingle Bells…" (Ren)<br/>
What is this person doing?<br/>
I knock on his window and call out to him.<br/>
Ren looks up. He looks like he is about to cry.<br/>
"What happened?" (Naofumi)<br/>
"I-It’s nothing." (Ren)<br/>
I peer into Ren’s room.<br/>
Inside, there is a table with an array of fancy food on it and a cake in the center. It is set for three people.<br/>
…So neither Female knight nor Taniko showed up?<br/>
I can understand Taniko, but Female knight… you too?<br/>
What do these people think the good intentions of others are? Why did they ignore Ren’s offer?<br/>
…Wait, I am Santa right now. I should look at this from Santa’s perspective.<br/>
Does she seriously intend to do that?<br/>
Christmas monster hunting may be over but does she plan to leave him like this?<br/>
(TL: They use a really bad pun that works in English but I will not use it here. They pretty much say she made his Jingle Bells into Single Bells)<br/>
How sad…He worked quite hard, and for this end to a holiday.<br/>
Is what I think from Santa’s perspective. Not much of a difference.<br/>
*sigh*… There’s no choice, I’ll do a little bit of work for him.<br/>
It’s on the way, anyways.<br/>
"Ren." (Naofumi)<br/>
"What is it?" (Ren)<br/>
I pull two presents out of my bag and throw them at him.<br/>
"Hold on to those, and don’t open them. Something good will happen." (Naofumi)<br/>
"Ah…" (Ren)<br/>
"See you later." (Naofumi)<br/>
I proceed to give Firo orders.<br/>
She starts running enthusiastically and we take off.<br/>
From afar, she looks like a reindeer running though the sky.<br/>
There. I see Female knight watching the sky from a well-hidden location. Taniko is there as well. They are practicing swinging their swords near the monster stable.<br/>
I get off of the sled in a place they can’t see and approach them as if I was simply in the middle of a walk.<br/>
"What are you two doing? Everyone is already asleep." (Naofumi)<br/>
"? Naofumi huh. I’ve told you before, but today I plan to stay up in order to give my thanks to that old man. Windea has said that she wishes to accompany me." (Female Knight)<br/>
"Yeah! I want to thank Santa!" (Taniko)<br/>
Taniko is sporting a pair of extremely pure eyes.<br/>
I think Ren will regain his composition if I bring these two to him, but it seems they are dead set on meeting Santa Claus.<br/>
"About that. I came here because the white haired old man imparted a message unto me." (Naofumi)<br/>
"WHAT!?!" (Female Knight)<br/>
"He told me that he had left the presents of the two people waiting outside the monster stable with the sword hero."<br/>
"KU! That old man did an unnecessary thing! Windea, let us go acquire our presents from Ren." (Female Night) (TL: for acquire, she uses a word that is closer to steal, snatch, plunder…etc)<br/>
"Understood!" (Taniko)<br/>
Female Knight and Taniko leave in a hurry.<br/>
This will let Ren enjoy Christmas a little… Is what I want to believe.<br/>
"You…" (Gaelion)<br/>
Gaelion emerges from the stable and stares at me.<br/>
"You did something unnecessary." (Gaelion)<br/>
"I don’t know what you’re talking about. I just found The Hero of the Sword crying to himself to be too pitiful. You would have done the same." (Naofumi)<br/>
"That is… You’re right, but… Yes that is pitiful, but…" (Gaelion)<br/>
"I thought I would play Santa and give Ren a hand." (Naofumi)<br/>
"*Sigh*… I guess there’s no choice. Those two had been giving off a strange aura and staring at each other the entire time. Now the monsters in the stable can finally sleep." (Gaelion)<br/>
It seems the stable’s residents were still awake.<br/>
Until now. The night is now completely silent.<br/>
What? Did those two think they would miss Santa if they left for Ren’s place?<br/>
Well… it didn’t take much to get them to go<br/>
Even I found Ren’s display pitiful<br/>
And with that, I have given Ren his Christmas present<br/>
"Oh yeah, Please give these presents to the monsters here." (Naofumi)<br/>
"There’s no point if you don’t give them yourself." (Gaelion)<br/>
"The monsters don’t even believe in Santa. All of their wishes were addressed directly to me." (Naofumi)<br/>
They were all things like ‘Eating Naofumi’s homemade food’ or ‘Playing with Naofumi’.<br/>
I give the presents of the ones who actually asked for iitems to Gaelion.<br/>
"By the way, what does Kogaelion? He never hung up a wish slip"<br/>
"Fumu… I’ll ask him."<br/>
Gaelion enters the stable and begins a long debate.<br/>
"… That’s impossible. Order something else."<br/>
And as such, the debate continued. What could he want?<br/>
"He wants a hug from you." (Gaelion)<br/>
"Why do I have to…" (Naofumi)<br/>
"He says it is a form of Skinship" (Gaelion) (TL: bonding through physical contact)<br/>
"… I see" (Naofumi)<br/>
Is it that custom that is prominent overseas? (TL: Not where I’m from)<br/>
I hug Gaelion, who has changed into Kogaelion form.<br/>
"KYUAAAAAA!"(Kogaelion)<br/>
And he lets out a loud cry. His spirits are really high.<br/>
"What a strange person" (Naofumi)<br/>
I would learn the meaning behind these actions a little later…<br/>
"Mu~…" (Firo)<br/>
Firo is glaring at me from the shadows.<br/>
Is she jealous? She really is on bad terms with Gaelion.<br/>
She should learn from Rafu. He gets along with Gaelion just fine.<br/>
As there is nothing left to do here, I board Rafu’s Sleigh and we depart.<br/>
"Next is… Motoyasu and the Filo Rials." (Naofumi)<br/>
It is now snowing heavily.<br/>
Has Motoyasu fallen asleep yet?<br/>
Well, He’s done a lot today. In eating and playing, he has been the first in line for everything. I have the present for Motoyasu himself, and the one for the Filorials. They would probably be happier receiving it from Motoyasu than from me.<br/>
I peer into the house. Motoyasu is indeed asleep, surrounded by Filo Rials.<br/>
I quietly get off the sled.<br/>
"Firo, can you lower your head" (Naofumi)<br/>
"? Sure!" (Firo)<br/>
Following my orders, Firo lowers her head. I carefully remove some feathers from her crest.<br/>
(TL: Her Ahoge evolved over time. Remember, the Filo Rial Queen gave Firo a feather)<br/>
I place these in a box and throw them at Motoyasu with all my might.<br/>
They made a soft sound as the hit the ground near Motoyasu. The Filo Rials near him turn in their sleep, but otherwise remain silent.<br/>
Well, Motoyasu should be satisfied with this.<br/>
Merry Christmas<br/>
I wonder why I am giving presents to Motoyasu as well. Well, I’m Santa for now.<br/>
After that I circled the village and districted presents to Imya and the rest of the townsfolk.<br/>
Though Imya lives inside of a hole, so I left his present with his uncle.<br/>
While I was going around, I witnessed Rishia inside of the Dining hall.<br/>
What is she doing?<br/>
She seems to be staring Itsuki in silence.<br/>
The mood is quite Christmassy<br/>
"Ah, it’s Naofumi, isn’t it?" (Itsuki)<br/>
Itsuki spots the flying sled, and calls to us with his hand in the air.<br/>
I should ignore him. I would ruin the mood.<br/>
But there is no choice as he has noticed me. So I park the sled and go to meet him.<br/>
"What are you two doing up so late at night?" (Naofumi)<br/>
"Eh, We were watching the village. It puts our hearts at ease." (Itsuki)<br/>
"It seems like you were just flirting with Rishia…" (Naofumi)<br/>
"How cruel… I don’t have such motives. Rishia merely admires me. There is no love involved." (Itsuki)<br/>
(TL: (－‸ლ))<br/>
"Fe~ T-that’s right. We are only here for vacation, anyways…"<br/>
Rishia hesitated for a moment before she answered, however, Itsuki immediately confirmed her statement.<br/>
This is the opposite situation from Ren<br/>
"I’m wrong?" (Naofumi)<br/>
"Yes, I have no ulterior motives, and Rishia understands this. For now, I am simply training to make sure I do not go down the wrong path."<br/>
Rishia is nodding, but her face looks like it is about to cry.<br/>
Could this be what me and Rafatalia’s situation looks like from an objective viewpoint?<br/>
"Ah… Well…" (Naofumi)<br/>
"If it’s about delivering presents, then we can help." (Itsuki)<br/>
"N-no… It’s fine" (Naofumi)<br/>
Instead of pushing this relationship with Santa’s authority, it is probably best to leave it be.<br/>
These are the heroes that come to the village the least.<br/>
They should be allowed to rest for a while.<br/>
"Well, I guessed as much" (Itsuki)<br/>
"Ha…" (Naofumi)<br/>
Itsuki can sometimes be quite sharp.<br/>
It’s not like he isn’t thinking of me.<br/>
"Anyways, this is for you two." (Naofumi)<br/>
I take out two bottles of specially brewed wine and give it to them.<br/>
"It’s quite potent, so drink in moderation." (Naofumi)<br/>
This is the product of the research me and Ratt had put into the Lucor fruit I had previously been unable to modify.<br/>
The alcohol content is quite high, but the taste is decent. I have also put a weak enchantment on it to help it’s drinkers share their true feelings.<br/>
It is my hope that this will help the two of them open up to each other more<br/>
However, in the end, how well it goes is up to Rishia.<br/>
"Thank you" (Itsuki)<br/>
The result: both of them got extremely drunk and to this day, neither of them can remember what happened.<br/>
But it seemed that they had become closer than before by the next morning.<br/>
I could use the power of the spirits to check on them, but that would be rude.<br/>
After that…<br/>
"Na-o-fu-mi-cha-n!!" (Sadina)<br/>
Yep, it’s the second woman who wishes to corrupt this holy night.<br/>
This is why I brought more of that wine.<br/>
I throw the bottle with all of my strength at Sadina.<br/>
The alcoholic Sadina catches it and starts glugging it down.<br/>
As expected, it seems she’ll drink any sake if it’s close by.<br/>
"Ah… this one is quite potent. To weaken me this much with just one bottle… As expected of Naofumi. *hic*" (Sadina)<br/>
"I made it with you in mind. I’ll also have you speak your true feelings" (Naofumi)<br/>
"I love Naofumi from the bottom of my heart. Hurry and do fun things with Rafatalia so you can do fun things with me… Enough that you forget about Rafatalia." (Sadina)<br/>
…These are her true feelings, huh?<br/>
Yes. I should run. It’s dangerous here.<br/>
"Ah, wait~" (Sadina)<br/>
I signal for Firo, who is in the sky, to come to my aid, and keep running.<br/>
"I told you to wait!" (Sadina)<br/>
The drunk Sadina starts to cast magic.<br/>
「Revelation・Thunder Bolt X」<br/>
Above me, lightning begins to form.<br/>
However, I am the Shield Hero, this level of magic won’t even feel itchy.<br/>
I point my shield to the sky and prepare myself.<br/>
But to use Revelation level magic, is she trying to kill me?<br/>
"Ara~" (Sadina) (TL: I assume Firo picks him up and flies off at this point)<br/>
"Master, let’s go to Melty’s place as well" (Firo)<br/>
"…Yes, lets." (Naofumi)<br/>
This village is dangerous. We fly in the direction of castle.<br/>
