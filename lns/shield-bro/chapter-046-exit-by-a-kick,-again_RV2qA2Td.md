Chapter 46 - Exit by a Kick, Again <br/>
 <br/>
We arrived at the Hourglass of the Dragon's era. <br/>
As usual, the facilities give off a solemn atmosphere. <br/>
 <br/>
Sister: "Hero of the Shield-sama right?" <br/>
 <br/>
Just like before the sister stares at me with a suspicious expression. <br/>
 <br/>
Naofumi: "Yeah......" <br/>
Sister: "What do you want this time?" <br/>
Naofumi: "I want to Class up" <br/>
Sister: "Then...... 15 gold per person." <br/>
 <br/>
15 gold!? No matter how you look at it, that's too expensive! <br/>
The sister's expression doesn't change but her eyes are smiling. <br/>
You want to make me look like a fool for not being able to pay? <br/>
 <br/>
Naofumi: "Just 15 gold." <br/>
 <br/>
I reluctantly reach for my bag of money and produce 30 gold coins. <br/>
The sister's expression changes and produces a document. <br/>
 <br/>
Sister: "......It is prohibited for the Hero of the shield-sama" <br/>
Naofumi: "What did you say? What does that mean!" <br/>
Sister: "By the king's direct order, the Hero of the Shield is prohibited from getting a Class up" <br/>
 <br/>
That fucking king! I honestly want to kill him! <br/>
I especially need stats, and to top it off, that ridiculous Class up cost. Being turned down without even knowing about it. <br/>
At this rate it will be impossible to Level up! <br/>
Controlling any job changes without permission is just player control! <br/>
 <br/>
Naofumi: "Don't joke around!" <br/>
Sister: "That's the rules. In the first place, it is impossible for the Hero of the shield-sama......" <br/>
Naofumi: "Say that first!" <br/>
 <br/>
I burst into a fit of rage and knights start appearing from behind the reception. <br/>
 <br/>
Naofumi: "Tch! Fine! I get it!" <br/>
 <br/>
I stomp towards the Hourglass of the Dragon's era noisily. <br/>
 <br/>
 <br/>
Seriously, everything about this is unpleasant, especially this country! <br/>
 <br/>
Raphtalia: "But, what now?" <br/>
 <br/>
Raphtalia was troubled and muttered, this is certainly a big problem. <br/>
 <br/>
Firo: "Hey hey, what is that hour glass? Firo wants to see more!" <br/>
Naofumi: "Hold it" <br/>
 <br/>
While feeling unpleasant, I go take a look at the help section. <br/>
......Class up was found. <br/>
Class up is a ceremony that expands the possibilities of members who become Hero companions. <br/>
Let's check the Hourglass of the Dragon's era. <br/>
It is recommended that I do it after a ★ appears. <br/>
There is no growth limit for a Hero. <br/>
 <br/>
Heroes have no growth limit?...... <br/>
Does that mean I can get past level 40? <br/>
But, this is still very unpleasant! <br/>
If Raphtalia cannot Class up, there will be problems with our attack power. <br/>
 <br/>
Raphtalia: "What should we do?......" <br/>
Naofumi: "Can't be helped, we'll do this later." <br/>
 <br/>
Fortunately, raising our levels was not scheduled until after this wave has passed, I'll think about it afterwards. <br/>
There is also the trump card of having Raphtalia become an adventurer and acquire a class up recommendation that way. <br/>
It can probably be done with more money. <br/>
But, there is no time now.  <br/>
Searching for that would also be especially difficult. <br/>
That reminds me, the slave trader had slaves over Level 40. Wasn't I going to go there anyway to get a weapon for Firo? <br/>
 <br/>
Motoyasu: "Ahhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh!" <br/>
 <br/>
What’s that? <br/>
I turned around and see Motoyasu pointing at me. <br/>
 <br/>
Motoyasu: "You! What are you doing!" <br/>
Naofumi: "What? Don't apply some strange connection to me." <br/>
Motoyasu: "Are you trying to play dumb? I know. The owner of that fat bird is you." <br/>
 <br/>
Fat bird...... is he talking about Firo? <br/>
 <br/>
Naofumi: "Come to think of it, how’s your crotch?" <br/>
Motoyasu: "It was almost crushed, Thanks to this fucking guy!" <br/>
Naofumi: "What.....!? <br/>
 <br/>
It wasn't destroyed!? Don't joke around! <br/>
To be kicked by such power and still not lose its function? <br/>
 <br/>
Naofumi: "You haven't lived up to my expectations." <br/>
Motoyasu: "You bastard-" <br/>
Naofumi: "It's not me who did it! Why would your crotch be destroyed?" <br/>
 <br/>
I asked Raphtalia who looks amazed. <br/>
Oh right, Raphtalia was not there to witness this guy getting blown away. <br/>
 <br/>
Raphtalia: "Why are you looking at me with pity?" <br/>
Naofumi: "Because you missed a really refreshing moment?" <br/>
Raphtalia: "I don't need to know such a thing!" <br/>
 <br/>
Motoyasu: "Fine, hand over the fat bird! I'll kill him!" <br/>
Naofumi: "You want my bird? What even happened? You are the one who approached carelessly." <br/>
Motoyasu: "Are you feigning ignorance? I was kicked whenever that bird spotted me!" <br/>
 <br/>
Hm? What did he say? <br/>
Is it fate? <br/>
 <br/>
Naofumi: "What do you mean?" <br/>
Motoyasu: "I said, whenever we meet with your fat bird, it chases me to kick!" <br/>
 <br/>
I look at Firo. <br/>
Then Firo says. <br/>
 <br/>
Firo: "Yup. I kick him every time I see him" <br/>
Naofumi: "I see, I see, that's great" <br/>
Firo: "Ehehe" <br/>
Raphtalia: "Why are you praising her!?" <br/>
 <br/>
I pat Firo's head. <br/>
I noticed that on Motoyasu's nice equipment, there is a crotch protector in the groin area. <br/>
That is hilarious! This guy has a trauma! <br/>
I burst out laughing. <br/>
 <br/>
Naofumi: "Ahahahaha!" <br/>
Motoyasu: "That's enough you bastard!" <br/>
Motoyasu’s companions: "That's right! Motoyasu-sama, don't concern yourself with that unpleasant shield!" <br/>
 <br/>
What are you saying, you follower. <br/>
That fucking woman's face is red while denouncing me. <br/>
This is refreshing. <br/>
 <br/>
Raphtalia: "What a refreshing smile, I haven't seen Naofumi-sama smile like that before." <br/>
Motoyasu: "You-" <br/>
 <br/>
Motoyasu clenched his fist and grabbed my coat. <br/>
 <br/>
Firo: "Master~ Firo is hungry!" <br/>
 <br/>
The bird that cannot read the atmosphere asserted itself. <br/>
Motoyasu's gaze turns to her. <br/>
Pita. <br/>
Motoyasu stiffens when he makes eye contact with Firo. <br/>
......What's the matter? <br/>
 <br/>
Motoyasu: "Deryaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa!" <br/>
 <br/>
He takes a second look at me and throws a haymaker punch to my face, but I caught it. <br/>
 <br/>
Naofumi: "What was that? If you want to have a fight, use your spear" <br/>
Motoyasu: "Miss! Hurry up and run away! This guy is very dangerous" <br/>
 <br/>
Motoyasu shouts in the direction of Firo, trying to look like a good person. <br/>
That's the fat bird you wanted to kill not long ago. <br/>
Oh right, she's in her human form now. <br/>
Is it because she's pretty? That does seem like Motoyasu. <br/>
 <br/>
Firo: "Eh? Master is not dangerous, right~?" <br/>
Motoyasu: "That is your master!?" <br/>
 <br/>
Motoyasu's face is dyed with anger. <br/>
 <br/>
Motoyasu: "You have another slave again!" <br/>
Naofumi: "What's with you...... Do you have a problem because she's a woman?" <br/>
Motoyasu: "Wrong!" <br/>
 <br/>
I talk big. <br/>
 <br/>
Motoyasu: "Amazing...... This is the first time I saw such an ideal woman......" <br/>
Naofumi: "......Ha?" <br/>
Motoyasu: “I did not think a girl so similar to Flonne-chan would exist in the world!" <br/>
 <br/>
Who is that? <br/>
...... It's a game character. <br/>
That reminds me, Firo's appearance is that of a certain pure daughter angel who is from a game in my world. <br/>
(Tl note: http://i.imgur.com/9wNrM5N.jpg <- Flonne from Disgaea) <br/>
 <br/>
Motoyasu: "I, What a moe angel....." <br/>
Naofumi: "Shut up! I do not want to know your sexual preferences!" <br/>
Motoyasu: "Different worlds are the best!" <br/>
 <br/>
Motoyasu's tension reaches its climax. <br/>
The moods of his followers are the opposite. <br/>
I don't see the human being that flew into a rage a while ago. <br/>
However, I see Firo with a well-defined expression. <br/>
 <br/>
Motoyasu: "Miss, what is your name?" <br/>
Firo: "Uhmm It's Firo" <br/>
Naofumi: "Don't just answer honestly!" <br/>
 <br/>
Motoyasu takes Firo's hand affectionately. <br/>
 <br/>
Motoyasu: "This guy is probably working you like a coach horse. I will save you." <br/>
Firo: "Well, Firo deosn't pull the carriage like a horse." <br/>
 <br/>
You should just accept it. That's the kind of race she is. <br/>
 <br/>
Firo: "Firo pulled a heavy carriage everyday for more than a month!" <br/>
 <br/>
Annoying, I don't see this ending well. <br/>
 <br/>
Motoyasu: "You bastard-----!" <br/>
 <br/>
Motoyasu is being noisy. <br/>
I don't have a lot of time. I want to leave already. <br/>
 <br/>
Motoyasu: "Release Firo-chan!" <br/>
Naofumi: "This again!?" <br/>
 <br/>
It didn't work for Raphtalia, so it's Firo this time? <br/>
Do you want to take away my subordinates so much? <br/>
Motoyasu shouts with blood thirst and turned his spear to me. <br/>
At that time. <br/>
 <br/>
Firo: "What are you doing to master!" <br/>
 <br/>
Firo knits her eyebrows and asked. <br/>
 <br/>
Motoyasu: "Don't worry Firo-chan. I will save you!" <br/>
 <br/>
You're not listening! <br/>
Completely in his own world...... <br/>
 <br/>
Naofumi: "Anyway, that fat bird you were looking for. That's Firo." <br/>
Motoyasu: "Naofumi! You bastard! To say such a thing to a girl!" <br/>
Naofumi: "It's you. You're the one who has been calling Firo that. You even said you wanted to kill her." <br/>
Motoyasu: "Haa?" <br/>
 <br/>
This guy looks at me like I'm stupid. <br/>
Though, I do call her a fat bird. <br/>
 <br/>
Naofumi: "Anyway, stop complai-" <br/>
Firo: "Firo will protect Master~!" <br/>
 <br/>
With a Bofun, Firo returns to her true from. <br/>
 <br/>
Motoyasu: "Eh? What?" <br/>
 <br/>
Firo raises her foot and kicks Motoyasu in the groin while he is dumbfounded. <br/>
 <br/>
Motoyasu: "Ahhhhhhhhhhh-" <br/>
 <br/>
I was able to see it. With a perplexed expression, Motoyasu flies over 10 meters while spinning. <br/>
Furthermore, the crotch protector was shattered. <br/>
 <br/>
Motoyasu: "Uge!" <br/>
 <br/>
Were they destroyed this time? <br/>
No, they were probably okay. There was a crotch protector. <br/>
 <br/>
Naofumi: "Now then, let's ignore the fool and move on." <br/>
 <br/>
Raphtalia's face is blue and is muttering awawawa. <br/>
Still, his entourage is not trying to help him. <br/>
Well...... a lot of unpleasant feelings were blown away. <br/>
I must give Firo a reward. <br/>
 <br/>
Naofumi: "Alright, shall we go to the slave trader now?" <br/>
 <br/>
Firo returns to her human form with a frightened expression. <br/>
 <br/>
Firo: "Firo is going to be sold?" <br/>
Naofumi: "Don't worry, I'm not going to sell you, I'm going to buy you a reward." <br/>
 <br/>
It seems she has been faithfully following orders and whenever we come across Motoyasu, he is kicked, not to mention that blow just now. <br/>
This good behaviour must be rewarded. <br/>
 <br/>
Naofumi: "I shall buy the equipment you wanted." <br/>
Firo: "Yay! Firo also wants food too!" <br/>
Naofumi: "Yeah, definitely." <br/>
Firo: "Then, Firo wants food cooked by Master~" <br/>
Naofumi: "Very well. This will be special." <br/>
Firo: "Yaay~!" <br/>
 <br/>
Firo begins skipping happily.
