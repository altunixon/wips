      <p>The next day, 11th of the White Month.</p>

      <p>As I had planned, I started running the stall today.</p>

      <p>I got kidnapped by Lifuria on the 5th day of the White Month, so I was reopening after six days.</p>

      <p>The 『Kiba burger』 stall was tended by Leina Wu and the others as usual, while I took care of the 『Myam-roasted meat』 stall. We prepared 100 portions of each.</p>

      <p>I sold the same amount on the second day after my first off day, so I decided to prepare the same amount this time too. I will decide on the amount to prepare tomorrow based on the sales today.</p>

      <p>“Ara, it’s really different after stopping for such a long time! I haven’t seen so many customers since the day right after the house head conference.”</p>

      <p>Lala Wu beside me was all smiles. She was helping with my stall today.</p>

      <div class="imgBox">
        <img alt="Illustration" src="../Images/0004.png"/>
      </div>

      <p>After the morning rush was over, we sold 40 『Myam-roasted meat』. We should be able to sell all the portions we prepared, and I felt relieved.</p>

      <p>The 『Myam-roasted meat』 stall was finally reopening after closing for several days, which made the customers, especially the southerners, very happy. Just looking at my patrons’ smiles filled me with delight.</p>

      <p>This wasn’t too different from my work at the inn, but getting to see the smiles of my patrons from up close brought me irreplaceable satisfaction.</p>

      <p>With this joy and satisfaction in mind, I turned back to Leina Wu, who was resting beside the stall, and said:</p>

      <p>“Leina Wu, how is your side doing?”</p>

      <p>“We sold about 30 portions, similar to yesterday.”</p>

      <p>Zwei interjected unhappily: “It’s not 30 portions, it’s 28. Yesterday was 34, and the day before was 37, our sales have been affected.”</p>

      <p>Leina Wu looked down at her petite body puzzledly:</p>

      <p>“Zwei, why are you so mean towards Asuta? It’s all thanks to Asuta teaching us to cook that allowed us to do our business here.”</p>

      <p>“I know! I’m not complaining about it!?”</p>

      <p>That high-pitched voice was the same Zwei as usual.</p>

      <p>But I still quite liked that girl who had a more developed economic sense than other denizens from Forest’s Edge. Considering that she grew up in the twisted environment of the Tsun clan, her character was still acceptable to me.</p>

      <p>Anyway, Leina Wu’s group still rented two push carts after I reopened my stall, so another person joined us at our stalls.</p>

      <p>In the 『Myam-roasted meat』 stall were Lala Wu and me. The two 『Kiba burger』 stalls were manned by Leina Wu, Shela Wu, and Zwei. Leina Wu and I had to leave the stalls at noon, so Rii Sudora and Emma Min Lutim were to cover our duties.</p>

      <p>The Lutim house that couldn’t send anyone to work for me obtained two new family members in Zwei and her mother Aura and had enough manpower now.</p>

      <p>So, nominally, the Fa house only employed Lala Wu and Rii Sudora, while the rest were working for the Wu clan.</p>

      <p>Using her own judgment to form a contract with Milano Mast, prepare the ingredients, and sell the completed product, Zwei didn’t have to worry since the proceeds for all sales belonged to the Wu clan. The Fa house’s income dropped by half, but Ai Fa and I didn’t mind that at all.</p>

      <p>Ai Fa who was one of the escorts asked me quietly: “… Asuta, how do you feel about restarting work after stopping for such a long time?”</p>

      <p>Meanwhile, Shin Wu stood beside the 『Kiba burger』 stall.</p>

      <p>Including Ludo Wu, there were 6 escorts today. The other four were hidden in the woods behind.</p>

      <p>“Yes, I’m feeling much better. I hope we can resolve this incident properly and continue doing business in the Post Station Town.”</p>

      <p>Ai Fa stole a glance at me and then couldn’t help smiling:</p>

      <p>“… You look really happy.”</p>

      <p>“Yes, it’s thanks to everyone’s help.”</p>

      <p>After one night, Ai Fa returned back to normal.</p>

      <p>Not just me, Barcia also caused quite a ripple in Ai Fa’s heart… In any case, Ai Fa seldom showed her true feelings before others.</p>

      <p>Anyway, Ai Fa’s incredibly gentle smile gave me strength.</p>

      <p>Lala Wu who noticed that leaned over to me and whispered:</p>

      <p>“Hey, Ai Fa is showing more varied expressions nowadays. She even argues loudly with Ludo Wu occasionally too.”</p>

      <p>I didn’t feel that Ai Fa looked that more expressive to me, as I answered: “That’s right, Ai Fa is mingling with everyone in her own way.”</p>

      <p>Lala Wu laughed happily:</p>

      <p>“The men are quite enthusiastic about Ai Fa. Now that you mentioned it, Ai Fa is a hunter, but she isn’t cold-blooded.”</p>

      <p>“How mean. Lala Wu, did you always think this way about Ai Fa?”</p>

      <p>“Hmmp! She acted coldly to us all this time, so Asuta who had always boasted about being close to Ai Fa has no rights to complain, you know?”</p>

      <p>“You call that boasting? You are exaggerating.”</p>

      <p>Right then, Ai Fa called out: “Asuta.”</p>

      <p>She probably heard Lala Wu and I whisper to each other. I pulled away from Lala Wu, but it seemed I was mistaken. Someone I had met before came my way from the north.</p>

      <p>It was an old white-haired westerner with a buffed body wearing rags covered in soot, Michael of Turan.</p>

      <p>“Oh, Michael…”</p>

      <p>Before I could finish, he cut me off with a: “You really came back. You are lucky to escape after getting captured by a noble. You are even doing business casually here, how surreal.”</p>

      <p>Michael was glum and stubborn as usual. His face, that looked as if it had been carved from a tree, didn’t change either. I was elated to see that he was the same as always.</p>

      <p>“I’m sorry for the trouble I caused you lately…”</p>

      <p>“That’s right; you got into this trouble because you didn’t listen to my warning. You were lucky this time, but if you continue to defy the nobles, you won’t stay lucky forever.”</p>

      <p>At this moment, Ai Fa walked up and said: “Michael of Turan.”</p>

      <p>I broke out in cold sweat, but the truth was the opposite of my worries, and Ai Fa bowed to Michael:</p>

      <p>“Asuta came back safely thanks to your help. As the head of the Fa house, I give you my thanks.”</p>

      <p>“… What are you talking about, I don’t get you. A red-haired brat I have never seen before asked me where the Count Turan house was, and I simply told him.”</p>

      <p>“That was the thing that saved Asuta. I will never forget how you helped us after repeatedly warning us about interacting with the nobles.”</p>

      <p>Michael fell silent.</p>

      <p>Ai Fa bowed again and backed away.</p>

      <p>“Whatever, I don’t want to be involved with the nobles. I’m hungry, so I came here to buy lunch.”</p>

      <p>With that, Michael put his copper plates on the counter.</p>

      <p>“Alright, thank you for your patronage. Erm… Did Geta show up after that?”</p>

      <p>“That’s impossible. That kid is a wanted criminal in the Post Station Town, right? I don’t have any business with criminals.”</p>

      <p>I thought about defending Geta, but this wasn’t something that I could share with Michael, so I just made the 『Myam-roasted meat』 quietly.</p>

      <p>Michael took a bite, and the eyes below his tidy brows shone:</p>

      <p>“The taste, it’s different. Did you use Tau sauce…?”</p>

      <p>“That’s correct; as expected of Michael, I can’t hide anything from your tongue.”</p>

      <p>I had always wanted to add Tau sauce into the 『Myam-roasted meat』.</p>

      <p>But I didn’t want to change the dish that was so well-liked. So after closing for five days, I used this chance to execute this plan.</p>

      <p>I limited the Tau sauce to an amount that wouldn’t affect the cost price too much, but I still felt the taste improving too. 『Myam-roasted meat』 was inspired by Ginger-roasted meat, so I always wanted to season it with Tau sauce.</p>

      <p>“To think that such a high-class seasoning can be procured in the Post Station Town. This is a good taste.”</p>

      <p>“Yes, those dealing with Jaguar people can buy this in the Post Station Town. It is expensive, so I can’t waste it either.”</p>

      <p>“… Hmmp.”</p>

      <p>Michael grunted and slowly ate his 『Myam-roasted meat』.</p>

      <p>Something flashed across my mind and I said:</p>

      <p>“Erm, Michael, do you know a person named Roy?”</p>

      <p>“Roy? Don’t know.”</p>

      <p>“I see. Roy is an employee in the manor I was abducted to. He seemed to know you, Michael.”</p>

      <p>I felt that I shouldn’t ask too much about his past, but Michael didn’t seem to mind… He had his usual irritated expression as he said:</p>

      <p>“Speaking of which… When I was working in the ‘White Dress Lady Inn’, there was an apprentice by that name…”</p>

      <p>His jaws suddenly stopped moving.</p>

      <p>“Yes, Roy mentioned that inn too. He is a youth with curly brown hair and about my build. He said he was 19.”</p>

      <p>“Ho, it’s that kid, huh. It’s impressive of him to get scouted by that manor at such a young age.” Michael started eating again lacklusterly. “However, the people recruited by that manor have to either cook for their master forever or lose their reputation and get chased out. No one in the city will hire a chef that got kicked out of that place, so it’s a real gamble.”</p>

      <p>“… There is such an unreasonable rule? What a horrible way of doing things.”</p>

      <p>“If you have a problem with that, get out of Genos. The nobles are the ones who set the rules, so commoners will only be treated like fools for resisting.”</p>

      <p>“Then, you…”</p>

      <p>I wanted to ask why didn’t Michael leave Genos, but I felt that I shouldn’t touch on his troubled past.</p>

      <p>But Michael glared at me with a strong gaze and said:</p>

      <p>“I also have a family. Before they can fend for themselves, I won’t leave or let myself die. You also didn’t leave Genos because there are people tying you down, right?”</p>

      <p>“… That’s right.”</p>

      <p>“Then watch yourself and don’t cause trouble for your family.”</p>

      <p>After saying that, Michael suddenly leaned forward:</p>

      <p>“By the way, did you serve a dish you made to the master of that manor? The gossip in town is that his daughter is the culprit.”</p>

      <p>“No, her father didn’t eat anything I cooked.”</p>

      <p>“I see. Don’t forget my warning. If he knows about your skills, he won’t let you out of the rock walls ever again.”</p>

      <p>Using any means possible to get the chefs he favored and cutting off any retreat for the chef he wished to hire… The chefs who turned down his invitation would be exiled from the city… It sounded really lawless.</p>

      <p>“Why is he so obsessed with delicious food? From what I heard from you, his obsession appears more intense than normal.”</p>

      <p>“Hmmp… He is more afraid to die than anyone else, so his obsession isn’t strange. He possesses so much wealth that he would want to rule the world forever.”</p>

      <p>I still didn’t understand what Michael meant.</p>

      <p>Michael took his last bite and then glared at me:</p>

      <p>“Haven’t you seen that man? He is tormented by illness. A sickness of the organs that only the wealthy nobles would contract. He wanted to cure an illness he got from expensive food by using lavish food, and suffered for it.”</p>

      <p>I was dumbstruck.</p>

      <p>I thought his face was sickly… But Pyschkurewuss was actually troubled by an illness.</p>

      <p><i>Speaking of which, his dark green eyes… Could it be his kidneys? Or his liver?</i></p>

      <p>Neither of them were organs that would recover easily from illness.</p>

      <p>“You were forced to work in that manor’s kitchen, right…? Didn’t you see all sorts of herbs from Semu, dried Gyama organs, and other medical ingredients?”</p>

      <p>“N-No, I didn’t. I was in a small kitchen used to cook for the servants. There was plenty of sugar, honey, oil, and other valuable ingredients, but nothing particularly special.”</p>

      <p>“Hmmp. You didn’t go into the kitchen that man treats like his treasure trove. How fortunate.” Michael half-closed his eyes as he stared into space. “He fell ill because of his extravagant dining habits, so refraining from lavish dishes should be the right move. But that man possesses immense wealth and chose the opposite method. He gathered all sorts of ingredients from the continent and ordered his chef to make food to cure his illness. That man can’t stand living his days drinking bitter medicinal soup.”</p>

      <p>“B-But, he wouldn’t need Tau sauce, sugar, and nyuushi, right? I don’t know what his illness is, but since it was brought about by extravagant dishes, he should eat less salt, sugar, and Tau sauce.”</p>

      <p>“… He can’t stand such a lifestyle, that’s why he adds a bunch of medicinal herbs to neutralize the effect of salt, sugar, and Tau sauce. Despite his illness, he can’t give up on his craving for delicious food.”</p>

      <p>Michael shook his head hard and then held his right wrist with his other hand.</p>

      <p>The nerves on his right hand were cut, ending his life as a chef because he turned down Pyschkurewuss’ invitation.</p>

      <p>“He can’t cure his illness completely with such a method. I don’t want to spend my entire life cooking things that would wreck a person’s body. But whatever… I might die before that man does anyway.”</p>

      <p>After saying that, Michael reverted to his usual impatient look and glared at me:</p>

      <p>“… Enough talk. If you want to be a real chef, don’t get involved with that man.”</p>

      <p>“I understand.”</p>

      <p>I thought about Roy and nodded.</p>

      <p>Did Roy know about Michael’s incident? If he knew and still went down this path to hone his cooking skills, I had nothing to worry about… But if he didn’t know, I worried about his future.</p>

      <p>“… So, even if we leave that noble be, he won’t live for long, correct?”</p>

      <p>Ai Fa suddenly interjected.</p>

      <p>Michael glanced at her:</p>

      <p>“How would I know? If the medicine takes effect before the poison of the food does, he might live for five to ten years more. And… His obsession will be inherited by his daughter.” He said as he looked at Ai Fa and me. “Even if he dies, the next house head will be his daughter. And you people will be dealt with like an eyesore.”</p>

      <p>Was Pyschkurewuss’ daughter, Lifuria, beholden by gourmet food too?</p>

      <p>After hearing all sorts of things, I needed time to sort out my mind.</p>

      <p>“If it’s possible, leave this town. Never mind… I will just buy your cooking before you get caught and locked up behind the rock walls.”</p>

      <p>With that, Michael walked away briskly.</p>

      <hr/>

      <p>At noon, I handed the stall over to Rii Sudora and Emma Min Lutim, then left together with Leina Wu and the six escorts including Ai Fa to the 《Cryptic Venerable Inn》.</p>

      <p>However, the head chef today was Leina Wu. Vena Wu, Lala Wu, and I accompanied her as assistants.</p>

      <p>I could start work from tomorrow onwards, but there was no telling what would change after the 15th of the White Month. I accompanied them in order to explain this complicated matter to the innkeepers.</p>

      <p>“But if Asuta is cooking in the inn, who will be his assistant? Right now, the Fa house is employing Lala and Rii Sudora, correct?”</p>

      <p>Leina Wu asked, and I thought over it for a moment.</p>

      <p>“In this case… When Lala Wu and I will make our rounds to the inns, I think Emma Min Lutim should be counted as the Fa house’s employee.”</p>

      <p>“I see. So Lala is here to accompany Asuta, but not me and Shela.”</p>

      <p>“Yes. Leina Wu and Shela Wu are in charge of the Wu clan’s stall now. I can’t treat you like a mere helpers anymore, right?”</p>

      <p>After I said that, Leina Wu’s face turned gloomy.</p>

      <p>“Huh? Did I say something wrong?”</p>

      <p>“I think Shela Wu and I still need Asuta’s guidance. If we go on like this, it would be hard for us to make anything aside from 『Kiba burgers』… When Asuta starts working at the inn, rather than Lala, I hope you can let Shela Wu and me follow you instead.”</p>

      <p>“Oh, I see. Since that’s what Leina Wu thinks, I won’t harp so much about who is in charge of which stall.”</p>

      <p>Speaking of which, when I had to leave the stall, Lala Wu and Shela Wu switched places. Right now, only Shela Wu and I could make 『Myam-roasted meat』.</p>

      <p>I could only leave things to Shela Wu when leaving the stall, and didn’t want to relegate the Leina Wu to an assistant either… But, to be honest, I hoped Leina Wu and Shela Wu could gain more experience.</p>

      <p>“Yes, that’s right… I think it’s about time to let Rii Sudora make the 『Myam-roasted meat』. Then Shela Wu can come along with us to the inns.”</p>

      <p>“Yes… But I still haven’t learned that skill either, so it’s a little frustrating.”</p>

      <p>Leina Wu had not mastered the way to grill the stronger tasting 『Myam-roasted meat』 meant for sale yet.</p>

      <p>Despite her still short time working at the stall, she had already taken exclusive control over the 『Kiba burger』 stall and took part in the work at the inns, so this couldn’t be helped.</p>

      <p>“How about letting Leina Wu practice how to make 『Myam-roasted meat』 that taste the same first…? If Shela Wu also learns to make the 『Kiba meat soup』 for the inns, we will have more freedom in our schedules.”</p>

      <p>I felt that Leina Wu and Shela Wu could learn that in just a few days.</p>

      <p>“Also, I plan to visit the 《Kimyusu’s Tail Inn》 every day, so if Leina Wu and Shela Wu can assist me, we can solve all our problems. When Leina Wu is the head chef, I will be the assistant, and when I’m the head, Leina Wu will assist me.”</p>

      <p>“Alright, that will make Shela Wu and me happy too.”</p>

      <p>Leina Wu’s sorrowful face turned into a bright smile.</p>

      <p>“… However, if the meeting with the nobles fell through, all these arrangements would be for naught.”</p>

      <p>“Yes. Donda Wu and Kamyua Yost are trying their best to avoid this, but I have no idea how things will end.”</p>

      <p>“If they need more time to resolve the issue, we can continue staying in the Morga Forest’s Edge and continue with our business, and I will be fine with that. Compared to the time, when Asuta was abducted, I feel much more relaxed now.”</p>

      <p>After saying that, Leina Wu showed an even more innocent smile. It was so pure and free of worries that it reminded me of her sister Rimee Wu. I nodded and thanked her sincerely.</p>

      <p>I felt a gaze on my nape and turned back. But no one was staring at me, although Ai Fa was looking at the pedestrians on the streets with a pouting mouth. She probably used her hunter’s reflex to avert her gaze before I turned my head.</p>

      <p>“What is it?”</p>

      <p>Leina Wu asked confusedly, and I shook my head and answered: “It’s nothing.”</p>

      <p><i>Ai Fa was probably happy to see Leina Wu and me building a wholesome relationship through cooking and business… Probably.</i></p>

      <p>We finally arrived at the 《Cryptic Venerable Inn》.</p>

      <p>But at this moment, I felt like sighing.</p>

      <p>The large totos carriage from the Count Taliem house was parked along the street of this residential area.</p>

      <p>“Well, well, I have been waiting for you, Asuta. Let us go straight into business.”</p>

      <p>Neil ushered us to the dining hall. Aside from Polarse, there were three slender middle-aged men in lavished attires waiting for us.</p>

      <p>I suppressed the urge to sigh for the second time and sat down opposite Polarse.</p>

      <p>“What brings you here this time? I thought we already discussed everything yesterday…”</p>

      <p>“Yes, we grilled the poitan perfectly by using the method you taught us! So we are here today to research how well poitan can be preserved before and after grilling. It would be great if the grilled poitan that is made into powder could be preserved as well as fuwano powder, but we couldn’t be certain of that yet.”</p>

      <p>I was surprised at how far he had progressed.</p>

      <p>I have always wanted to test how long powdered poitan could be preserved for.</p>

      <p>“Well then, before selling powdered poitan, we still need to let the farmers increase their poitan yield, so I have decided to do some prep work and advertised the deliciousness of poitan in the Post Station Town first! The Count Satolas house will also help, and we are choosing the stalls and inns that will use poitan as a substitute for fuwano. Aside from that, we plan to sell poitan products ourselves too.”</p>

      <p>“Sell yourself? Are you going to set up a stall?”</p>

      <p>“Yes! The best way to gain popularity is to sell delicious food! Although the Forest’s Edge dishes are well-received in the Post Station Town, there are many westerners who hate kiba too. Even I don’t have the resolve to try eating kiba too.”</p>

      <p>“I see…”</p>

      <p>“That’s why I plan to make the dish with ingredients from the city. My goal isn’t to make money, so I can just serve luxurious dishes without caring about profits. However… The head chef from my house lectured me, saying that won’t do.”</p>

      <p>It seemed that the middle-aged man beside Polarse was that head chef.</p>

      <p>He looked a little nervous before Ai Fa, Shin Wu, and the other Forest’s Edge hunters, but he still straightened his body.</p>

      <p>“This is the head chef of the Count Taliem house, Yang. Yang, can you repeat what you told me?”</p>

      <p>“Understood. Pardon me… But it’s obvious that we can make luxurious meals by using expensive ingredients. But even if we get rave reviews with this method, the poitan would get relegated to the sidelines. In my humble opinion, food to be sold in the Post Station Town should be made with ingredients from the Post Station Town.”</p>

      <p>“That’s how it is. I’m here to consult with Asuta who already had success in Post Station Town.”</p>

      <p>“I see, that makes sense. But a major factor in my success is the kiba meat. Because of the high fat content in the kiba meat, it is actually a higher grade ingredient than karon thigh meat and skinless kimyusu meat.”</p>

      <p>“Yes, skinned kimyusu tastes bland. I have never tried karon thigh meat before though…” Yang answered emotionlessly. “Karon thigh meat is sold in the Post Station Town, while the other parts are sold in the city. It had been this way for ages”</p>

      <p>He was less than half as fat as Polarse, and his thin face had a determined face.</p>

      <p>“Speaking of which, Yang is from the city but treats high-quality ingredients with disdain. In any case, the expensive ingredients have all been bought out by chefs working for Pyschkurewuss, so he has the belief that how delicious a dish is doesn’t depend on the price of the ingredients.”</p>

      <p>“I see. I think the same too.”</p>

      <p>I answered sincerely.</p>

      <p>I was surprised that such a gutsy chef lived in the city.</p>

      <p>“However, it would be hard for the dish to gain acclaim. The Post Station Town doesn’t have reten oil, mamaria vinegar or Jaguar sugar, right? I don’t think it’s possible to make any decent dishes without those seasonings.”</p>

      <p>“No, please wait. Other than kiba meat, I’m also researching on karon and kimyusu meat dishes. I’m wondering if karon milk can be bought in the Post Station Town… Is it hard to make nyuushi and curd from karon milk?”</p>

      <p>“You will need to prepare the facilities. Making nyuushi isn’t that difficult…” At this moment, the head chef’s eyes shone in enlightenment. “… It’s true that karon thigh and kimyusu meat lack sufficient fats. If we can’t use reten oil, we can only make some simple dishes. By using nyuushi… we can improve the quality of our cooking by several levels.”</p>

      <p>“Is it possible to make nyuushi ourselves?”</p>

      <p>“We can if we have the manpower. First, the karon milk needs to be left to sit for one night, then, we can scoop up the fats on the surface, put them into a bag, and beat them.”</p>

      <p>“Yes, we can separate the water and the fats that way.”</p>

      <p>I got excited for some reason.</p>

      <p>“But what about its price? I heard one copper plate is enough for one bottle of karon milk, but we can only get a small amount of nyuushi from one bottle.”</p>

      <p>“That’s true, but the amount of nyuushi used for each meal is minuscule too. We just need to make poitan and nyuushi popular in the Post Station Town.”</p>

      <p>“That’s great. I finally see the light in the tunnel.”</p>

      <p>Polarse smiled:</p>

      <p>“By the way, can you procure Jaguar sugar and Tau sauce here? With these two seasonings, we can make a wider variety of dishes.”</p>

      <p>“I bought Tau sauce from an innkeeper, but sugar can only be bought from the city.”</p>

      <p>“Is that so? Is sugar that expensive?”</p>

      <p>In response to Polarse’s question, the head chef shook his head:</p>

      <p>“Sugar isn’t as expensive as Tau sauce. The problem is, Lord Pyschkurewuss spares no expenses in buying out all the stock of sugar. The sugar we buy in the city are just the leftovers.”</p>

      <p>“I see. I’m more eager to topple Pyschkurewuss’ reign now.”</p>

      <p>Polarse said something dangerous with a calm face.</p>

      <p>“But first will be the karon milk. Does Lord Pyschkurewuss buy out their supply too?”</p>

      <p>“No. The merchants from Dabag are selling it, but only in the neighboring towns. They are probably just selling the leftovers too.”</p>

      <p>“Then we can procure karon milk in the Post Station Town and make nyuushi ourselves.”</p>

      <p>I said happily, but the head chef glared at me for unknown reasons:</p>

      <p>“You must be Asuta of the Fa house. Are you really happy about this…?”</p>

      <p>“Huh? What do you mean?”</p>

      <p>“If nyuushi is freely available, we can make top quality dishes with karon thigh meat. If that happens, won’t the kiba lose its advantage of being rich in fats?”</p>

      <p>I wasn’t worried at all.</p>

      <p>“Kiba is already delicious by itself and won’t lose out to skinned kimyusu meat. If having nyuushi is enough to stop the sales of kiba meat, then kiba meat doesn’t have any commercial value in the first place.”</p>

      <p>“You are very confident.”</p>

      <p>“It’s not because I’m confident of my culinary skills. I’m just confident in how delicious the kiba really is.”</p>

      <p>The head chef fell into a deep silence, while Polarse laughed in stark contrast:</p>

      <p>“You are really humble. I had the good fortune of trying your cooking too; that deep-fried kimyusu you made is exemplary! Despite your young age, your skills are outstanding; that’s why I want to discuss this with you.”</p>

      <p>“You flatter me, it’s my honor.”</p>

      <p>After answering that, I asked something in response to what he said about fried food:</p>

      <p>“I wish to clarify something. How long can grilled fuwano be kept? And if we leave the grilled fuwano to dry, will the texture change?”</p>

      <p>“Grilled fuwano will turn hard after one night. Fuwano tastes the best fresh out of the oven… It won’t spoil for a few days. I heard many travelers on short trips bring dried fuwano and cook it together vegetable stew. But… It doesn’t taste much better than poitan, so travelers still buy poitan.”</p>

      <p>I was happy to hear the head chef’s answer:</p>

      <p>“Thank you very much. The truth is, I want to break dried fuwano into crumbs and add it to food that needs to be fried. I already bought some fuwano and will leave it to dry overnight.”</p>

      <p>Fuwano was similar to wheat; after grilling it and leaving it dry, it should be similar to breadcrumbs coating. Pancakes and crushed nuts could substitute for breadcrumbs too.</p>

      <p>“Drying grilled fuwano and grinding it into powder? That’s a strange idea. Can you make delicious dishes with that?”</p>

      <p>“Yes, I can. I think it is possible to make the deep-fried kimyusu that Polarse tried a few days ago as well.”</p>

      <p>If I could buy eggs, I could challenge making cutlets and croquettes.</p>

      <p>These dishes all required a large amount of kiba oil, so it would be hard to recreate them in the Post Station Town… But just imagining what Ai Fa and the others would think of these dishes made me feel pumped.</p>

      <p>I then remembered what Michael said about indulgence in delicious food resulting in organ illness.</p>

      <p><i>Deep-fried food is the prime example of high-calorie dishes.</i></p>

      <p>If it was just the calories, all Forest’s Edge denizens were engaged in laborious chores, so there was no need to worry. However, dishes that contained lots of fat still made me worry.</p>

      <p><i>I should complement it with some vegetables… Something with dietary fiber and citric acid, so tino, tarapa, and gigo? I can make something like Worcestershire sauce by using Tau sauce, but Forest’s Edge denizens will probably prefer shiru fruit flavored sauce.</i></p>

      <p>Similar to Michael, I didn’t want anyone’s health to suffer from eating my food.</p>

      <p>As I was thinking about that, Polarse said energetically: “Okay! Despatch a messenger to Dabag immediately! Give him some money and make him return with the karon milk tomorrow. Yang, get ready to open your stall the day after tomorrow.”</p>

      <p>“Huh? We are opening the day after tomorrow?”</p>

      <p>“Yes. To be frank, I wanted to start tomorrow. Anyway, we need to act before Lord Pyschkurewuss realizes that something is afoot. You also want to throw Lord Pyschkurewuss off-balance before the 15th of the White Month, correct? That’s what I heard from Zashuma.”</p>

      <p>“Yes, it is as you say…”</p>

      <p>But the 15th of the White Month was just four days away.</p>

      <p>Would this abrupt action really be effective?</p>

      <p>“It will be fine. I’m also in danger of being disowned by my father. For the bright future of the Count Taliem house, denizens of the Forest’s Edge, and the citizens of Genos, I will do everything within my powers. Let’s work towards a good show two days later!”</p>

      <p>After that, Polarse kept laughing until he left.</p>
    </section>

    <section epub:type="subchapter">
      <h2 id="sigil_toc_id_6">2</h2>

      <p>Nothing of note happened after bidding Polarse farewell, and we ended today’s work peacefully.</p>

      <p>We catered 『Kiba meat soup』 and fresh kiba meat to the 《Cryptic Venerable Inn》 and 《Big Tree of the South Inn》, and used karon to research a new meat dish in the 《Kimyusu’s Tail Inn》. At the same time, Shela Wu and the others finished their job at the stalls.</p>

      <p>Worth mentioning was that we sold everything at the stalls.</p>

      <p>I wondered how long this trend would continue, but in any case, we had to prepare the same number of dishes tomorrow.</p>

      <p>Milano Mast had decided to sell the “Kimyusu meatball” since last night. We tried adding the plum-like mashed kiki, and there didn’t seem to be any issues. Milano Mast commented that: “Thanks to you, only the karon meat didn’t sell out.”</p>

      <p>Which meant the prototype we made earlier, ‘Fried shredded karon”, could be sold tonight too. By tendering the tough karon thigh meat and cutting it as thin as possible and frying it together with aria and pula, it was then seasoned with fruit wine and pico leaves, becoming a dish the people in the Post Station Town had to spend money to buy.</p>

      <p>The taste could be improved with Tau sauce, but Milano Mast didn’t permit to buy Tau sauce from his competitor.</p>

      <p>Milano Mast said: “Using fruit wine and pico leaves is luxurious enough. No one will complain about this.”</p>

      <p>And so, the 《Kimyusu’s Tail Inn》 known for having mediocre food got to revitalize its reputation.</p>

      <p>“Let’s work on soup and vegetable stew tomorrow. Karon thigh meat might be suitable for these dishes, so things will go smoothly.”</p>

      <p>Not getting to use Tau sauce was a pity… Could we use tarapa for the vegetable stew?</p>

      <p>I tried picking Leina Wu’s brain.</p>

      <p>“Tarapa, huh. I think it will work! If we cook it a bit longer, the karon and kimyusu meat would produce stock too, and if we are mindful of the cost when using vegetables, we should be able to make a wonderful dish.”</p>

      <p>“… Hey, did you forget your initial goal?” Milano Mast interjected with a frown. “You are teaching me to cook in order to sell your kiba meat dishes, right? If I can cook a good meal with kimyusu and karon meat, your work is over.”</p>

      <p>“Is that so? But won’t it be nice to prepare a new soup dish?”</p>

      <p>“If the menu is so varied, there won’t be any market for kiba meat, correct?”</p>

      <p>“It’s fine. Milano Mast, you know how tasty kiba is.”</p>

      <p>I joked intentionally.</p>

      <p>Milano Mast closed his mouth unhappily.</p>

      <p>“Anyway, let’s do what we can before the 15th of the White Month. As I said, we don’t know if we can continue doing our business after that.”</p>

      <p>If we failed to uncover Pyschkurewuss’ true nature, we had to stop our business indefinitely.</p>

      <p>It would be a month before the Fou house and Sudora house could take over the escort duties from the Wu clan… When I told them I might have to stop for a month, Neil, Naudiz and the others all looked so sad that it surprised us.</p>

      <p>“But when that time comes, we can let the Wu clan send fresh kiba meat over to them for sale. We can also make the dishes at home and send them over.”</p>

      <p>When they heard that, Neil and Naudiz both answered: “Please do!”</p>

      <p>As for the 《West Wind Inn》, when I told them I couldn’t continue the business discussion until after the 15th of the White Month, Yumi couldn’t help sighing.</p>

      <p>“Sigh… If only Asuta met my Dad before all this happened… Are we not fated to work together?”</p>

      <p>“Not at all! If I can continue my business, I will definitely have a proper talk with Yumi’s Dad!”</p>

      <p>“Really? Can I trust a man who didn’t keep his words last time!? My Dad is still angry, you know.”</p>

      <p>“Well… Please let me apologize to him for missing the appointment.”</p>

      <p>“Let’s talk about this later. If you don’t calm down, blood might be spilled in that conference. Anyway… Please work hard so you can continue your business in the Post Station Town!”</p>

      <p>“I will, thank you.”</p>

      <p>That was all we talked about.</p>

      <p>I learned on the way back to the Forest’s Edge about another thing that was bothering me.</p>

      <p>It was about Kaslan Lutim. With permission from the tribal chiefs, Kaslan Lutim went to the Post Station Town alone to meet with Zashuma and informed him about the plan.</p>

      <p>He told Zashuma that Forest’s Edge denizens suspected that Pyschkurewuss was the one manipulating Zattsu Tsun. The Forest’s Edge denizens would also hold a conference with Pyschkurewuss on the 15th of the White Month with regards to the disposition of the Tsun clan main house members. And if Forest’s Edge denizens couldn’t accept what Pyschkurewuss said, they would not hand over the Tsun clan main house members even if they had to clash swords.</p>

      <p>“Well… Anyway, we can’t sew people’s mouths up. Instead of waiting for weird rumors to spread, it’s better for us to relay the accurate message directly.”</p>

      <p>That was what Zashuma said.</p>

      <p>“I understand. I don’t know how effective this will be in just four days, but we will do whatever we can to spread the word.”</p>

      <p>After informing Shela Wu and the others at the stalls about this, Kaslan Lutim immediately returned to the Forest’s Edge.</p>

      <p><i>What will tomorrow bring?</i> I thought on our way back to the Wu Clan village.</p>

      <p>“Oh, good work today.”</p>

      <p>I parked the wagon behind the main house, and Barcia was really chopping wood there.</p>

      <p>There were two men chopping wood with her, and I was surprised at the sight of them:</p>

      <p>“Ryada Wu and Mida… What’s happening?”</p>

      <p>Shin Wu and Shela Wu’s father, Ryada Wu, and member of the Wu clan, Mida.</p>

      <p>“This guest is as strong as a Forest’s Edge denizen. A man has to watch her if she picks up a blade.”</p>

      <p>Ryada Wu who was so slender that it was hard to imagine him being Donda Wu’s brother answered me with his trademark calmness. He was a middle-aged man with a straight face, dark brown hair tied behind his head, and a nice beard on his face.</p>

      <p>“However, the other men have started their hunting preparations, so Mida and I who aren’t hunting have to watch her.”</p>

      <p>Ryada Wu used to be a hunter like his son, then he took a kiba tusk in the knee. Mida was training his endurance to avoid dragging the others behind.</p>

      <p>The choice of candidates made sense, but the three of them together gave a big impact.</p>

      <p>“Asuta… You sell many food…?”</p>

      <p>Mida held freshly chopped firewood in his huge arms as he looked down at me.</p>

      <p>He seemed to be thinner now, but his body was still like a balloon.</p>

      <p>“Yes, it’s been a while since we last sold 『Myam-roasted meat』 after all. I prepared a lot, but it all sold out.”</p>

      <p>“Hmm…”</p>

      <p>Mida grunted quietly but didn’t move his body. He stared at me with his pig-like beady eyes.</p>

      <p>Two nights ago, I returned after several days of absence, and Mida looked at me with the same eyes. After hearing that I was kidnapped, Mida had been in a daze. He did his daily work as usual, but spoke much lesser. And when his work was done, he stood in place like a small hill and stared into space.</p>

      <p>And… When I returned, Dan Lutim showed up, and it was as rowdy as a wedding. Mida then returned slowly to the main house and said:</p>

      <p>“Mida, no cry…”</p>

      <p>I almost broke down in tears when I heard that.</p>

      <p>Yamiel Lei said Mida was missing a part of his soul, but I knew that the part that cares for others still remained with him.</p>

      <p>He lived with Zattsu Tsun, but he didn’t get twisted mentally like his other family members. Was it because he was slow-witted, or was he strong…? I couldn’t figure it out, but I had no doubt that in his huge body was the pure spirit of a denizen of the Forest’s Edge.</p>

      <p>“By the way, that’s a lot of firewood. You chopped this much in one day?” Ludo Wu stood behind me and asked.</p>

      <p>Mida moved his head slightly: “No…”</p>

      <p>The fats on his throat and shoulders stopped him from moving his head further.</p>

      <p>“Fetch water flasks… tan hides… I do many many chores…”</p>

      <p>“Is that so. Thank you for your hard work. That’s enough firewood, have a break until dinner.”</p>

      <p>“If your chores are done, how about training with me again, Mida?”</p>

      <p>That was Shin Wu.</p>

      <p>After finishing his escort duties, Shin Wu had a test of might practice match with Mida. Shin Wu definitely felt regret because he failed to protect me from Sangjura. Ludo Wu glanced at Shin Wu sideways and scratched his head.</p>

      <p>“Shin Wu, you have guard duty in the day and at night. You should rest when you have the chance.”</p>

      <p>“It’s fine. I want to be stronger.”</p>

      <p>“Yes… Mida is fine too… But Ryada Wu, fine to not chop wood…?”</p>

      <p>Ryada Wu looked at his son’s stubborn face and nodded with a calm gaze.</p>

      <p>Mida and Shin Wu then left together with the other hunters that guarded us, leaving only Ai Fa and Ludo Wu behind.</p>

      <p>“Huh? By the way, where did that boy go?”</p>

      <p>“Leito went to the Post Station Town. He had an errand to run.”</p>

      <p>Ludo Wu frowned after hearing that from Ryada Wu.</p>

      <p>Ludo Wu seemed unsure how to treat Leito. It wasn’t because Ludo Wu didn’t trust him, he just found it hard to speak with that young boy who was as elusive as his master, which was also a little worrying. I felt the same too.</p>

      <p>“Then let’s get to work. If possible, I want to help make dinner. Where’s Mia Lei Wu?”</p>

      <p>“Isn’t Mama Mia Lei in the kitchen? She’s on duty today.”</p>

      <p>I nodded in response to what Lala Wu said and picked up Gilulu’s reins again.</p>

      <p>Barcia suddenly asked: “You are preparing dinner? Can I watch? I’m curious about how the delicious food I ate last night was made.”</p>

      <p>“Well, you will need permission from Mia Lei Wu who is in charge of the women.”</p>

      <p>Our group walked towards the kitchen as we spoke.</p>

      <p>I was about to peek inside the open kitchen door when Vena Wu came out.</p>

      <p>“Ara… Everyone came back…”</p>

      <p>“Yes. Is Mama Mia Lei in? Asuta says he wants to help make dinner.”</p>

      <p>“Yes… Mama will be right here… Asuta, you are going to help today too…?”</p>

      <p>“Yes, if it’s not troubling you.”</p>

      <p>“No one in the Wu clan village thinks of Asuta as a burden…”</p>

      <p>Vena Wu said with a smile. Her flirtatious figure made my heart race.</p>

      <p>Vena Wu had always been like this; it made me wonder whether her hormone suppression was really working.</p>

      <p>But recently, her flirtatiousness increased a little every time I met her. It seemed that she was different from before… The melancholy in her face was deeper, and she seemed tired and distracted.</p>

      <p>She was clearly speaking less, and she didn’t show her innocent smile at all. Even when looking at someone, her gaze seemed to be staring far away and out of focus. This melancholy made Vena Wu more beautiful.</p>

      <p>… Having half a year to think over it might be a bit too long.</p>

      <p>“I wish, marry into Wu clan.” After saying that, Shumimaru left Genos. It had been ten days since then.</p>

      <p>As I was thinking about that, Mama Mia Lei appeared from the back of the house.</p>

      <p>“Oh, are you going to help with dinner tonight? Thank you very much.”</p>

      <p>Mama Mia Lei said with a refreshing smile.</p>

      <p>“Of course, we are happy to have you. But I will feel bad if Asuta helps us every day.”</p>

      <p>“I’m also worried whether my help in preparing dinner so regularly will infringe on some customs in the Forest’s Edge.”</p>

      <p>“Don’t worry; given how close the Wu clan and the Fa house are, you can be more casual about this.”</p>

      <p>That might be so, but dinner was a sacred action for the people of Forest’s Edge to receive life to live another day. I had to keep Jiza Wu and the others, who were opposed to the Fa house, in mind and not act recklessly.</p>

      <p>However, since I was staying in the Wu clan village, Ai Fa wouldn’t be able to eat the food I cooked if I didn’t assist to make dinner, so I wanted to help.</p>

      <p>“Feel free to come any time. We have to start preparing the Poitan and soup.”</p>

      <p>“Thank you very much, I will do my best to make a dish that will please everyone.”</p>

      <p>But first, I had to prepare the ingredients for tomorrow.</p>

      <div class="imgBox">
        <img alt="Illustration" src="../Images/0005.png"/>
      </div>

      <p>Leina Wu, Shela Wu, and Lala Wu started making the meat patty, while I cut the meat for the 『Myam-roasted meat』. Ryada Wu went back to his home, while Ai Fa and Ludo Wu stayed behind to watch over Barcia.</p>

      <p>“Fufu, so this is kiba meat, huh. The bright color makes it look tasty.” Barcia stood in a corner to not get in our way and said to us with an energetic voice: “I’m envious that you can eat the prey you risk your life to hunt. Gaje leopard eats people, so we can only sell their hide and fangs.”</p>

      <p>“Oh, so Marsala hunters don’t eat carnivorous animals?”</p>

      <p>In Genos, there were taboos on eating the carrion-eating munto and gizu too.</p>

      <p>“Of course. But we have to venture into the territory of the Gaje leopard to hunt the baro-baro bird. For a Marsala hunter to do their job properly, they need to be capable of killing a Gaje leopard.”</p>

      <p>“I see. The hunters on the mountains have it hard too.”</p>

      <p>I replied to Barcia as I cut the kiba loin with my Jaguar made meat cutting knife.</p>

      <p>By the way, this meat was brought here by Ai Fa in the morning. Before I got abducted, Ai Fa’s work had been going smoothly, so I could still use the Fa house’s meat for my business for the time being.</p>

      <p>“What’s for dinner today?”</p>

      <p>Ai Fa asked when I just finished cutting the meat.</p>

      <p>“It’s been a while, so I decided to make ‘Roast kiba’. I will use diced aria and Tau sauce as the base to make something known as a Japanese style sauce.”</p>

      <p>“… Is that so.”</p>

      <p>Ai Fa’s eyes were saying “Why aren’t you making hamburg steak.”</p>

      <p>Donda Wu and the others wouldn’t complain if I made hamburg steak and meat soup, but they weren’t that popular here. I replied with my gaze that since we were guests, we shouldn’t take things too lightly.</p>

      <p>Ai Fa turned her head away. There were still four days before the 15th of the White Month. Could Ai Fa bear with this until that day comes? And could we return to the Fa house after that? It seemed that peace within the Fa house was still so far away.</p>

      <p>As Leina Wu made the hamburg steak patty that Ai Fa was craving so hard for, she stole a glance my way.</p>

      <p>“Asuta, you will be using that powder for tonight’s dinner?”</p>

      <p>On the working counter was the fuwano powder that I brought from a fuwano store Milano Mast told me about on my way back.</p>

      <p>“Yes. We will use a bit of this tonight. Erm… Mia Lei Wu, sorry, but can I help with dinner tomorrow too?”</p>

      <p>“As I said, there’s nothing to apologize for. If you are fine with it, you can come and help every day, Asuta.”</p>

      <p>“Thank you very much. I will prepare tomorrow’s merchandise first.”</p>

      <p>I took a large plate, then poured water and fuwano powder in.</p>

      <p>And so, after two days, I finally made a fuwano pancake again.</p>

      <p>Shela Wu asked: “So that’s the fuwano that the people in town are eating? It’s quite different from poitan.”</p>

      <p>She seldom shared her feelings, but Shela Wu was as passionate as Leina Wu towards cooking.</p>

      <p>“That’s correct. Poitan is in a semi-liquid state before grilling, while the fuwano powder is solid; that’s the biggest difference.”</p>

      <p>There wasn’t any need to mold it into any shape, so I decided to grill the fuwano in the flat frying pan.</p>

      <p>The grilled fuwano had a texture similar to poitan but was whiter. Lala Wu, Mama Mia Lei, and the others looked curiously at my work.</p>

      <p>“So what are you going to do with this? Isn’t it just like a poitan after grilling it?”</p>

      <p>“I will let it dry, and it should be ready tomorrow. I’m going to use it as an ingredient for my new dish.”</p>

      <p>I recalled Shela Wu and the others saying that the shape of the grilled poitan wouldn’t change even if left alone for one night. In any case, Polarse should be doing poitan research on his side too, so I had to concentrate on research whether fuwano could replace breadcrumbs.</p>

      <p><i>If poitan becomes the staple food in Genos just as Polarse planned, fuwano won’t be completely useless either.</i></p>

      <p>Unlike fuwano, poitan didn’t have wheat-like properties.</p>

      <p>For example, fuwano was more suited for making desserts and vegetable stew.</p>

      <p>As of now, I had only seen two types of cereal— poitan and fuwano, so I wanted to make further use of their characteristics for cooking.</p>

      <p>“Alright then, let’s start dinner preparations.”</p>

      <p>When she heard what I said, Leina Wu made a weird squeal:</p>

      <p>“A-Asuta, can you wait for a bit!? We will be done here soon!”</p>

      <p>“Oh, is Leina Wu in charge of dinner tonight?”</p>

      <p>“No, it’s Lala’s turn. But I don’t have any pressing matters to attend to, so I want to learn from Asuta too.”</p>

      <p>Shela Wu also asked: “… Can I learn too?”</p>

      <p>“I’m fine with that, but Shela Wu, don’t you have to do the chores in your home?”</p>

      <p>There was still some time before the sunset, but there were only Shela Wu and her mother at her house. After finishing preparing the ingredients to be sold, she still needed to hurry home and do her chores.</p>

      <p>Shela Wu was working on the tarapa sauce after finishing the meat patty and looked at me with sad eyes:</p>

      <p>“But… It’s a rare chance for Asuta to cook in the kitchen here, so I want to learn too. If not, I will fall behind and trouble Leina Wu…”</p>

      <p>“Shela Wu, what are you saying? You are more skilled at making the food we are selling.”</p>

      <p>“That’s not it. I can’t cook the soup as well as Leina Wu, aren’t you better at cooking than me?”</p>

      <p>“I don’t think so. Shela Wu who has been helping Asuta since the beginning is more knowledgeable and experienced than me.”</p>

      <p>Leina Wu who was as bright as the sun and Shela Wu who was as dreamy as the moon argued without stopping their hands.</p>

      <p>They thought of each other as rivals, but they were still kins. If the older Shela Wu wasn’t so formal with her words, this would be like a squabble between two sisters. This made my heart feel at peace.</p>

      <p>Lala Wu, who was tending to the hearth fire, suddenly said: “W-What about Shela Wu and I switching? Tali Wu can’t do this alone, so I will go over and help.”</p>

      <p>Shela Wu looked at her in surprise:</p>

      <p>“I’m very grateful, but if you help in the kitchen there, you can’t eat dinner over here, you know?”</p>

      <p>“Ehh… Then I’ll eat at Shela Wu’s place, and Shela Wu might eat at my place. It’s fun to switch every now and then.”</p>

      <p>Lala Wu started to blush while speaking.</p>

      <p>Seeing her like this, Ludo Wu exclaimed: “So that’s what you are after! And at the same time pretending to be considerate of Shela Wu, how dirty! You are the one who wants to visit Shin Wu’s place.”</p>

      <p>“Who said that! Stupid Ludo, don’t say such incomprehensible things so loudly!”</p>

      <p>“What else could that mean? Never mind, Shin Wu will be happy too, so it’s all good, right?”</p>

      <p>Lala Wu grabbed a firewood and chucked it at Ludo Wu.</p>

      <p>“Vena-nee and Leina-nee aren’t married yet, but a thirteen-year-old like you is already so thirsty… Could the first one to marry out of the main house be… Hey, what the hell!?”</p>

      <p>Firewood flew towards Ludo Wu from three different directions. The sisters displayed great teamwork in their simultaneous attack, and Ludo Wu used the firewood in his hand to knock away the projectiles in a panic.</p>

      <p>“Hey, take it outside. Don’t let the splinters get into the food.”</p>

      <p>Mama Mia Lei scolded them with a smile.</p>

      <div class="imgBox">
        <img alt="Illustration" src="../Images/0006.png"/>
      </div>

      <p>At this moment, Barcia said with a grunt.</p>

      <p>“Being with your family is better after all. I want to hurry up and find that wandering son of mine.”</p>

      <p>I looked back and saw a surprisingly gentle smile on Barcia’s stone lion-like face.</p>

      <p>Mama Mia Lei smiled at that.</p>

      <p>“Your son is your only family, right? I will pray to the forest, may you reunite with your son soon.”</p>

      <p>“Thank you very much. To be honest… I have doubts about believing Kamyua Yost. But after learning what kind of people Forest’s Edge denizens, the enemies of my husband, actually are, I think leaving Marsala was worth it.”</p>

      <p>Mama Mia Lei who had seven children and took care of the household chores, and the outlaw Barcia who made a living as a hunter for the sake of her young child. This was a meeting between two strong mothers.</p>

      <p>I then glanced back at Ai Fa.</p>

      <p>Ai Fa was expressionless as she observed this scene with an eye closed.</p>

      <p>Upon noticing my gaze, she calmly turned her face towards me.</p>

      <p><i>Having a family sure is nice.</i></p>

      <p>I wondered what Ai Fa was thinking about.</p>

      <p>But for the two of us who lost all our family, we gained an irreplaceable family in each other.</p>

      <p>As I thought about this, the sun set slowly.</p>

      <p>Could we protect our peaceful lives? The decisive moment slowly inched towards us.</p>

      <h2 id="sigil_toc_id_7">3</h2>

      <p>“Ah, Asuta, you are finally here!”</p>

      <p>The next day, 12th of the White Month, after renting the stalls from the 《Kimyusu’s Tail Inn》, we visited Uncle Dora’s stall along the way to buy vegetables and were welcomed by him.</p>

      <p>“W-What’s the matter? Did something strange happen again?”</p>

      <p>“Alright, come over here! Let me tell you properly!”</p>

      <p>I was brought under the shade of his stall.</p>

      <p>Tara who was standing by his feet looked uneasy too.</p>

      <p>“Asuta, are the rumors that Forest’s Edge denizens will leave Genos true?”</p>

      <p>Uncle Dora leaned his panicky face towards me while holding both my arms.</p>

      <p>Upon hearing that, I understood what he meant.</p>

      <p>“No, Forest’s Edge denizens are just getting ready to face the noble with this kind of resolve. We are just trying to come to a mutual understanding and consensus, and will not leave Genos so hastily.”</p>

      <p>“Which means, if you can’t find an acceptable path forward, you guys will leave Genos? That’s going too far!”</p>

      <p>Uncle Dora was very agitated; it was rare seeing him so worked up.</p>

      <p>Tara started tearing up too.</p>

      <p>“No, leaving Genos is our last resort. No one in Forest’s Edge wishes for such an ending. And, of course, I don’t want to abandon Genos either.”</p>

      <p>“But, it’s impossible for the nobles to admit that they are wrong. Right from the start, we are not from the same world.”</p>

      <p>Uncle Dora was very anguished and had a scowling expression.</p>

      <p>“If Forest’s Edge denizens get exploited by the nobles, you won’t be happy about it either, right? But, isn’t the entire matter over? The culprits are dead, so there’s no point in arguing about this further.”</p>

      <p>In just one night, Uncle Dora already grasped the entire story.</p>

      <p>Speaking of which, Zashuma said he often saw Uncle Dora at the taverns he frequented. Since there were overlaps in the places they visited, this situation was only natural.</p>

      <p>I finally realized my negligence. I knew that Kaslan Lutim planned to spread this news in the Post Station Town, so I should have informed my friends about it in advance.</p>

      <p>“I’m sorry, Forest’s Edge denizens won’t obey the orders of the Genos landlord if they befuddle us. We hope to arrive at a conclusion that we can agree on and continue our work as a hunting tribe… Can you believe us on that?”</p>

      <p>“I want to believe you too, but… the Turan Count might be more difficult to handle than the Genos landlord. Will Forest’s Edge denizens be fine?”</p>

      <p>“… I believe in the strength of the Forest’s Edge.”</p>

      <p>Uncle Dora gave a huge sigh.</p>

      <p>At this moment, Ai Fa spoke.</p>

      <p>“Stall owner, thank you for your concern… But it’s about time for you to let Asuta go.”</p>

      <p>“Huh? Ah, sorry. But… I want to continue getting along with you all.”</p>

      <p>“Yes, I’m glad there are westerners like you who open their heart to us. I never had the chance to tell you, but I think that’s very wonderful of you. So… As Asuta said, I hope you will believe and wait for us.”</p>

      <p>Uncle Dora turned towards the commendable Ai Fa and said weakly:</p>

      <p>“Can I put my faith in you? I’m… I’m a little scared. I wonder if the nobles underestimated the prowess of Forest’s Edge denizens.”</p>

      <p>Ai Fa frowned in confusion.</p>

      <p>I also didn’t get him at all.</p>

      <p>“When Asuta was abducted, all of you were furious, right? Dozens of Forest’s Edge denizens went straight to the city gate, wondering if Asuta has been murdered inside the Genos city.”</p>

      <p>As he spoke, Uncle Dora’s big body started trembling:</p>

      <p>“And, of course, the city mustered many soldiers. But the denizens of Forest’s Edge were all armed, and if they clashed with Genos… The city probably wouldn’t stand a chance.”</p>

      <p>“B-But, there are only 500 people in the Forest’s Edge, correct? And less than half are hunters…”</p>

      <p>“Asuta, can you picture Forest’s Edge denizens losing? I can’t imagine it at all. Even if you lose… Both sides would suffer heavy losses.”</p>

      <p>Uncle Dora unconsciously patted Tara’s head as she clung to his leg.</p>

      <p>“Back then, I think, the people inside the rock walls still didn’t get it. The denizens of Forest’s Edge work wholeheartedly in their job because they are a proud tribe… If you anger them, they can destroy a city easily. The nobles didn’t understand this, and acted haughtily before the denizens of Forest’s Edge.”</p>

      <p>“… But, even if we do go to war against the nobles, we won’t drag you into it.”</p>

      <p>“Yes, I know. But if Genos is ruined, we will be finished too. No… A new noble will build a new city here, and we will still make a living. But the denizens of Forest’s Edge will lose their place in the western kingdom, and will have to migrate to Mahildra, correct? I don’t wish for that to happen.”</p>

      <p>Uncle Dora looked at Ai Fa with a needle-like gaze: “I hope we could get along as fellow citizens of Genos. I’m not the only one who thinks this way. So, please, don’t be too hasty about it.”</p>

      <p>“My father is the tribal chief of Forest’s Edge and might speak frivolously. However, he will bet his life and soul to carve out the correct path for his Forest’s Edge tribemates.”</p>

      <p>Ludo Wu overheard our conversation and walked up to us.</p>

      <p>“Morga Forest is our home. We won’t abandon our home so simply. And we won’t let the nobles toy with us easily, so please believe us.”</p>

      <p>“Really? Will you continue to be good friends with Tara?”</p>

      <p>Ludo Wu looked at the uneasy Tara and laughed:</p>

      <p>“That runt Rimee keeps clamoring about wanting to see you. When this matter is over, I will bring her to the Post Station Town to meet you. You two can play together then.”</p>

      <p>“Yes!” Tara nodded.</p>

      <p>Uncle Dora patted Tara’s head with an expression between a laugh and a cry.</p>

      <p>“I will pray to God and hope the nobles change their minds. By the way, one of the noble’s sons supports the Forest’s Edge.”</p>

      <p>“Ah, the second son, Polarse, right? That’s the son of the Count that oversees the farmlands, which was a surprise.”</p>

      <div class="imgBox">
        <img alt="Illustration" src="../Images/070.png"/>
      </div>

      <p>“That’s right. He is known as the problematic second son, but he was a big help to Asuta, which made me feel a little proud by extension.” After saying that, Uncle Dora showed an uneasy face that felt different than before. “But, just what is that second son scheming? I heard the news that he wants us to farm more poitan, and to do that without letting the people from the city notice. Both are strange requests.”</p>

      <p>“… That might be relevant to the problem we have at hand, but I should refrain from commenting on it.”</p>

      <p>“So that’s true. If it will help the denizens of Forest’s Edge, I will plant as many poitan as it takes.”</p>

      <p>With that, Uncle Dora finally smiled, although it still looked a little strained.</p>

      <hr/>

      <p>After that, I chatted about this with some of the customers patronizing my stall.</p>

      <p>The word had spread faster in the inns and taverns than I expected.</p>

      <p>“How reckless. You all might as well move to Jaguar right away.”</p>

      <p>“That’s a good idea. Forest’s Edge denizens hail from Jaguar in the first place. If you are treated poorly in the western kingdom, you might as well go back.”</p>

      <p>The ones who told me that were the workers who used to work under Pops Balan.</p>

      <p>Shumimaru also urged me to move to the eastern kingdom of Semu in the past too. I felt glad that my acquaintances invited me to their home countries.</p>

      <p>But that was a different matter. Migrating to Semu or Jaguar wasn’t that easy.</p>

      <p>If the denizens of Forest’s Edge gave up on hunting kiba and left Genos, they would be branded by the western kingdom as traitors. Even if friendly states like Semu and Jaguar accepted them, this would still lead to an international crisis.</p>

      <p>That was why Uncle Dora mentioned about us moving to Mahildra. After abandoning the western kingdom, Forest’s Edge denizens could only head towards the enemy nation of Mahildra.</p>

      <p>Furthermore, changing one’s faith wasn’t easy either. Could the denizens of Forest’s Edge who changed their faith eight decades ago do so again? And would the enemy nation of Mahildra accept Forest’s Edge denizens? The denizens might get ostracized by all the countries and religions.</p>

      <p>Anyway, leaving Genos wasn’t something anyone wanted to see. We, the denizens of Forest’s Edge, also wanted to continue to live in Genos, in our homes in the Morga Forest. And so, we had to settle our differences with Pyschkurewuss.</p>

      <p>“… The town seemed really crowded today.”</p>

      <p>Shortly before noon, Michael who visited the stall asked me with a frown:</p>

      <p>“You are finally facing off against the nobles, huh? The world sure is unfair.”</p>

      <p>“I’m very sorry. The matter will probably conclude by the 15th of the White Month.”</p>

      <p>I made 『Myam-roasted meat』 for Michael as I answered with a smile.</p>

      <p>Michael’s face was the same as usual. He suddenly looked over to the 『Kiba burger』 stall.</p>

      <p>“By the way… Did that girl learn to cook from you?”</p>

      <p>“Hmm? Yes, that’s right. The dish over there is as good as in my stall.”</p>

      <p>“I bought food from that stall when you got kidnapped, so I know that. You are a foreigner who learned to cook from your father, correct?”</p>

      <p>“Yes. I was born in an island state called Japan; my father cooks for a living.”</p>

      <p>“I’m not too familiar with things overseas… Anyway, your father is an outstanding chef.”</p>

      <p>“Yes, he’s the man I respect the most in the world.”</p>

      <p>I said without any doubts.</p>

      <p>The subject himself wouldn’t be able to hear this anymore, even though I should have told him this earlier.</p>

      <p>“Your cooking is different from others. And this kiba meat is a top class meat on par with karon meat, so it’s only natural for it to be well received.”</p>

      <p>He seemed to be implying that I needed to be wary of Pyschkurewuss because of that.</p>

      <p>While I was at a loss on how to answer, something shocking slowly drew close. It was a large box carriage drawn by Totos heading here from the north… The carriage belonged to the Count Taliem house.</p>

      <p>The carriage quickly entered the marketplace and stopped. According to the rules in the Post Station Town, the driver needed to alight and continue on foot while holding the reins.</p>

      <p>However, the carriage simply stopped there, and two people alighted. The two persons coming my way were the head chef of the Count Taliem house, Yang, and his bodyguard.</p>

      <p>When he saw the lavish clothes of someone from the city, Michael backed away with a sour face. Yang and his bodyguard then stood at that emptied spot:</p>

      <p>“Mr. Asuta, the karon milk from Dabag has been delivered. Lord Polarse instructed me to share some with you if you need it. What say you?”</p>

      <p>His every word and action were formal and polite.</p>

      <p>However, he was an elder older than my father, so I felt a little uneasy.</p>

      <p>“Thank you very much. I can just take any excess milk you might have.”</p>

      <p>“Alright then, would sharing one white copper plate worth with you be enough for you? After this, the meat merchant will deliver milk once every few days, so you can procure your desired amount by placing your order with him.”</p>

      <p>“I’m grateful for the help. Erm… Can the people in the Post Station Town buy from him too?”</p>

      <p>“Of course. He is a merchant that delivers meat to Genos anyway. When my food goes on sale from tomorrow onwards, anyone will be free to buy karon milk.”</p>

      <p>In that case, I could further improve the menu for the 《Kimyusu’s Tail Inn》. After finding kimyusu eggs and fuwano powder, a new ingredient joined the lineup.</p>

      <p>“Alright then, there’s a pot filled with milk in the carriage, could you…”</p>

      <p>Yang’s expression froze mid-sentence.</p>

      <p>He turned his head to look at Michael who was eating a 『Myam-roasted meat』.</p>

      <p>“Could… Could you be, the head chef of the ‘White Dress Lady Inn’, Mr. Michael?”</p>

      <p>Michael looked impatiently at Yang.</p>

      <p>“I have nothing to do with people from the city, just leave me alone.”</p>

      <p>“I-I’m Yang, formerly employed in the ‘Selva Spear Inn’, and currently the head chef of the Count Taliem house. Pardon me, but I heard that Mr. Michael already left Genos…”</p>

      <p>“Didn’t you hear what I said? I’m just a bum working in a coal shop. If you want to buy coal, take your money and visit my shop in Turan.”</p>

      <p>Both of them had just passed their prime years, but Yang seemed to be a little older.</p>

      <p>Yang looked at Michael with eyes of reverence.</p>

      <p>“When I heard a chef like you lost your future and got exiled from the city, I was incredibly saddened. But after seeing that you are fine, I…”</p>

      <p>“You are really annoying, even the food tastes nasty now.”</p>

      <p>Michael said with a disdainful face and tossed the last bits into his mouth.</p>

      <p>“Mr. Michael, are you eating the dish prepared by Mr. Asuta? Are you and Mr. Asuta acquainted? So the reason why the daughter of Count Turan targeted this young chef is that…”</p>

      <p>“N-No, I only met Michael recently. It’s not like what you said.”</p>

      <p>I shook my head quickly, and Michael grunted with displeasure:</p>

      <p>“A chef I know won’t make food that tastes so incredible. You will understand if you try the brat’s dishes.”</p>

      <p>“Yes, I have yet to try Mr. Asuta’s dishes… Are they made from kiba meat?”</p>

      <p>“That’s right. The kiba’s loin and chest meat was used and got roasted with fruit wine, myam, and Tau sauce.”</p>

      <p>Yang looked troubled.</p>

      <p>Michael laughed at him with contempt.</p>

      <p>“The tongues of city dwellers are so pampered that there’s no reason to eat kiba. I don’t know why you are here in the Post Station Town, but if you don’t want to upset your stomach, scamper back to the rock walls and eat your karon meat.”</p>

      <p>“No, I…”</p>

      <p>“I still have work to do, I have no time for you.”</p>

      <p>With that, Michael turned and left.</p>

      <p>Yang still looked troubled as he watched Michael leave.</p>

      <p>“… Michael must have been a famous chef.”</p>

      <p>“Of course! The ‘White Dress Lady Inn’ isn’t big, but when Michael was their head chef, their reputation was on par with the ‘Selva Spear Inn’. To me, he is one of the best chefs in Genos.” Yang explained passionately and then slouched his thin shoulders depressedly.</p>

      <p>“He met with such misfortune because he got headhunted by the Turan Count… Mr. Asuta, you don’t have to hide how you feel. I can’t forgive Count Turan who treats chefs like tools either. That’s why I still decided to help Sir Polarse even if I would get admonished by Count Taliem.”</p>

      <p>“I see. I’m glad that I could work together with someone like you.”</p>

      <p>That was my sincere thought.</p>

      <p>The thin head chef looked at me with renewed vigor in his eyes:</p>

      <p>“… Mr. Asuta, can I buy one of your meals?”</p>

      <p>“Of course, it’s two red copper plates for one.”</p>

      <p>I used the meat I kept warm at the edge of the griddle to make one 『Myam-roasted meat』.</p>

      <p>This was probably the first time a city dweller tasted kiba meat.</p>

      <p>After hesitantly putting my 『Myam-roasted meat』 into his mouth, Yang stood in place stiffly.</p>

      <p>“So this is… kiba?”</p>

      <p>“Yes, it is; is the taste to your liking?”</p>

      <p>“… The texture is as good as karon breast and loin meat.” A brighter light shone in Yang’s eyes. “And this was made with ingredients that can be procured in the Post Station Town, correct? The ingredients are cheap enough for the product to be priced at 2 red copper plates.”</p>

      <p>“Yes, I only added a dash of Tau sauce.”</p>

      <p>“This is astonishing. I need to rethink the food that I will sell in the Post Station Town tomorrow.”</p>

      <p>With that, Yang pointed to the carriage parked by the street: “Please take some karon milk with you. I have to hurry on back to the manor.”</p>

      <p>“Understood. I will buy food from your stall tomorrow too.”</p>

      <p>Yang said determinedly: “I promise that I will make a dish that won’t disgrace me…”</p>
    </section>

    <section epub:type="subchapter">
      <h2 id="sigil_toc_id_8">4</h2>

      <p>The work for the day ended without incident too.</p>

      <p>After several days of absence, I could finally cater the 『Kiba sauté- Arrabbiata style』 and 『Meat Chachi』. Including the food sold at the stalls, we sold more than a hundred portions. Business was better than before the break.</p>

      <p>Thanks to Zashuma spreading the news in the Post Station Town, there was quite a number of customers who came to inquire about the situation. However, most of them were southerners and easterners, with their primary concern being “Can you continue your business?”</p>

      <p>The guards in town just glared at us with sinister looks and didn’t come near. No assailants appeared before us, and the bandits disguised as denizens of Forest’s Edge also went into hiding after I escaped from the Pyschkurewuss manor.</p>

      <p>“Things sure are peaceful.”</p>

      <p>Ai Fa said quietly from right behind the driver’s seat of the wagon.</p>

      <p>On the wagon were the three girls from the Wu clan, Rii Sudora, and a youth escort from the branch house. Two hunters rode on Lulu, and the other two rode on the Totos they borrowed from the Lei house. Zwei and Emma Min Lutim went back on foot under the guard of the six escorts who came in the afternoon.</p>

      <p>“The conference is three days away; I hope there won’t be any other incidents before.”</p>

      <p>“Yes, I hope things will stay peaceful after the conference too.”</p>

      <p>Not just Uncle Dora, Milano Mast, Neil, and the others were worried about the future of Forest’s Edge too.</p>

      <p>The resolution between Forest’s Edge and Pyschkurewuss would probably decide the future of Genos. This was the claw mark left behind by Zattsu Tsun and his collaborators.</p>

      <p>“Yo, you all came back safely today too.”</p>

      <p>Upon reaching the Wu clan village, we headed to the kitchen of the main house and found Barcia chopping wood behind the main house.</p>

      <p>“You are going to prepare dinner right away? Let me watch too.”</p>

      <p>All the hunters aside from Ai Fa and Ludo Wu already left, and the rest went into the kitchen. Aside from the absence of Ryada Wu, this scene was similar to yesterday.</p>

      <p>However, the ones on cooking duty would change from day to day. Today, Grandma Ditto Min and Rimee Wu were scheduled to prepare the dinner.</p>

      <p>“Actually, Lala is supposed to cook too; do you want to switch with Shela Wu today as well?”</p>

      <p>Rimee Wu, who was waiting in the kitchen, asked, and Lala Wu said with a red face: “You have a problem with that?”</p>

      <p>“No. Shin Wu will definitely be happy too, I think it’s good!”</p>

      <p>Rimee Wu was all smiles when she said that.</p>

      <p>She said the same thing yesterday too, which showed how innocent and pure she was. So Lala Wu couldn’t get mad at Rimee Wu and only blushed quietly.</p>

      <p>“So, what are we making today?”</p>

      <p>Rimee Wu who made her sister dumbstruck was still smiling as she clung onto my chest.</p>

      <p>“I plan to make a completely different dish today. So I want everyone to try it, and see if the denizens of Forest’s Edge will like it.”</p>

      <p>“Really? That’s great!”</p>

      <p>Rimee Wu’s red hair brushed against my chest. After I got back from Pyschkurewuss’ manor, Rimee Wu got more clingy towards me.</p>

      <p>“Hey, runt Rimee, Asuta is a man too, so don’t cling on him so much.”</p>

      <p>Ludo Wu sounded a little angry, but Rimee Wu buried her head in my chest and stuck out her tongue cutely.</p>

      <p>“You are annoying. Rimee will snuggle against whoever she wants!”</p>

      <p>Ludo Wu scratched his head.</p>

      <p>In order to keep the peace, I said: “Let’s get to work.”</p>

      <p>First was the ingredients for tomorrow.</p>

      <p>I started cutting the meat for 『Myam-roasted meat』 just like yesterday. One hundred portions might be a bit much, but it wasn’t difficult.</p>

      <p>After finishing that, I started on the dinner preparation.</p>

      <p><i>Today, I will finally challenge deep frying kiba steak… and make “Kiba cutlet”.</i></p>

      <p>“So, how’s the fuwano?”</p>

      <p>I inspected the fuwano powder I left on a plate yesterday.</p>

      <p>As Polarse said, the fuwano was completely dehydrated.</p>

      <p>It wasn’t to the extent of being rock hard, but it was dry enough not to budge when poked with a finger. Since it was about a centimeter thick, the inside was completely dry too.</p>

      <p>“Okay, this will do. Leina Wu, Shela Wu, if it is not too much trouble…”</p>

      <p>Before I could finish, I saw them working hard on their jobs and looking at me curiously.</p>

      <p>“Hey, hey, hey, what is that used for?”</p>

      <p>Rimee Wu grilled the poitan for dinner as she asked innocently.</p>

      <p>“I will be breaking this back into fine powder.”</p>

      <p>I then took out the mortar and the shell of some shelled animal I bought in the Post Station Town.</p>

      <p>I could turn the fuwano easily back into powder form with this tool. It might be primitive, but it’s very convenient to crush the tough fuwano.</p>

      <p>I made a small pile of fuwano powder on the counter.</p>

      <p>“And then, I will heat it up in a pot without adding any oil.”</p>

      <p>Instead of telling Rimee Wu, I was actually teaching Leina Wu and the others as I worked while explaining.</p>

      <p>With this, the fuwano turned into completely dry powder. It was a little yellow, but it looked just like a substitute for breadcrumbs.</p>

      <p>“Next would be the meat. I will cut the meat fibers and tenderize them with a stick. I need it to be more tender than grilled steak, so I have to beat it with a stick thoroughly.”</p>

      <p>I decided to use loin meat.</p>

      <p>If I was concerned with calories, I should have used the tenderloin or thigh meat, but I heard that it was easier to control the oil with loin meat.</p>

      <p>The thigh meat and tenderloin that didn’t have much fats would absorb the oil when deep fried… The one who taught me this trivia was my childhood friend Reina.</p>

      <p>“So I want to eat fried loin meat, not fried tenderloin!”</p>

      <p>The image of Reina eating my father’s pork cutlet with an innocent smile flashed across my mind.</p>

      <p>Taking the advice of a high school girl at face value wouldn’t be wise, but there was another reason I chose loin meat instead of tenderloin.</p>

      <p>Because of the shape of the meat.</p>

      <p>The tenderloin was long and thin, and would usually be sliced into small pieces.</p>

      <p>But being small meant the coating would be relatively larger and absorb more oil.</p>

      <p>I was trying to let everyone understand the deliciousness of deep fried cutlet and to make a dish that was different from the usual.</p>

      <p>Anyway, with the above reasons in mind, I decided to use the tenderloin meat.</p>

      <p>I thoroughly tenderized a piece of flat tenderloin. I wanted to let as many people try this as possible, so I chose a 500 g piece of meat. The tenderizing was done after it became 3 cm thick. At this thickness, it would be cooked in no time.</p>

      <p>“Okay, let’s crush the Pico leaves together with salt and make the coating.”</p>

      <p>I opened the cloth bundle I placed on the counter.</p>

      <p>Rimee Wu gasped in awe as she continued grilling poitan.</p>

      <p>“What’s that? It looks really cute!”</p>

      <p>“These are kimyusu eggs. Kimyusu is the name of the bird eaten by the people in town.”</p>

      <p>I bought these eggs from the kimyusu shop that raised kimyusu and sold their meat.</p>

      <p>The diet of Forest’s Edge denizens had plenty of animal protein, and I didn’t see anyone sell these eggs in the marketplace too, so almost everyone was seeing these eggs for the first time.</p>

      <p>“Crack it open into a plate and mix the yolk and egg white together. Coat normal fuwano powder onto the meat, pour the egg onto it, and then sprinkle the grilled fuwano crumbs onto it. Be careful not to make the coating too thick.”</p>

      <p>“Okay.”</p>

      <p>The voices of Leina Wu and Shela Wu answering came from a distance.</p>

      <p>“And now, it’s time to use the oil.”</p>

      <p>“Oil?”</p>

      <p>“The oil extracted from the kiba. The denizens of Forest’s Edge usually make candles with the oil, correct? This is the same oil.”</p>

      <p>I asked Ai Fa to bring over the oil that we made in the Fa house some time ago. Ai Fa rode on Gilulu back to the Fa house every morning to manage the kiba meat in our food store and brought over ingredients I would need to use.</p>

      <p>The oil was usually kept in leather pouches, but recently I started keeping it in a jar with a cover that was more airtight. The oil couldn’t rot, but it would turn sour with time, so I added a layer of fake rubber tree leaves on the underside of the cover.</p>

      <p>When I opened the cover, the milky oil was very thick, and several strings of it stuck onto the cover I removed.</p>

      <p>I used a spatula and poured enough oil to submerge one piece of meat into the pot.</p>

      <p>“When the oil is heated up, put the meat in. The hardest part about this is to maintain the heat… So I will teach you again when this dish is officially accepted.”</p>

      <p>I heard some voices saying “Yes”.</p>

      <p>I added more firewood into the stove, and the oil quickly turned translucent, and the surface started to waver. I kept the fire at medium and waited for a few minutes.</p>

      <p>I poked with my krilee chopsticks, and when the bubbles in the oil were about the right size, I added in a small lump of fuwano powder.</p>

      <p>With a crackling sound, the fuwano powder floated on the surface of the oil.</p>

      <p>It was almost ready. To avoid the meat and coating from absorbing too much oil, I didn’t intend to deep fry it for too long. It would be prudent to maintain the oil at 180 degrees.</p>

      <p>“Alright, let’s start frying. Ah… Rimee Wu, sorry, but can you lend me a few skewers?”</p>

      <p>Rimee Wu just finished grilling her poitan and quickly answered my request.</p>

      <p>After laying fake rubber tree leaves on the plate, I place the skewers over the top of the plate. This was a substitute for a wire mesh to hold the fried cutlet.</p>

      <p>I took a piece of meat covered in a coating and slid it into the pot.</p>

      <p>The oil crackled intensely this time.</p>

      <p>“Uwah, amazing!” Rimee Wu cheered.</p>

      <p>Ai Fa, Ludo Wu, and Barcia looked on it intriguely. Leina Wu and Shela Wu who were working some distance away seemed anxious.</p>

      <p>At this moment, the fragrance of deep-fried meat spread in the kitchen.</p>

      <p>“Fufu, this is another incredible dish after you made the hamburg steak.”</p>

      <p>Grandma Ditto Min who had finished preparing the kiba hotpot walked over with a smile.</p>

      <p>The color of the coating was starting to change too. When it turned golden, I picked it up with a skewer.</p>

      <p>“It will be done when the excess oil is drained off. Rimee Wu… Can you get four or five men here?”</p>

      <p>“Men? But why?”</p>

      <p>“Well, like what Ditto Min Wu mentioned, this is a special dish, just like the hamburg steak back then. I want some hunters who are more stubborn than Ludo Wu and Ai Fa to try it, and see if this is to the liking of Forest’s Edge denizens.”</p>

      <p>“Is that so? But the men have gone out to set their traps. Ah… Then I will get Ryada Wu! And Mida, and the men who just came back from the Post Station Town!”</p>

      <p>Rimee Wu dashed out of the kitchen.</p>

      <p>I didn’t think Mida was hard headed at all, but he seldom had the chance to try my dish, so it was fine.</p>

      <p>“Asuta, we have finished our work here too.”</p>

      <p>Leina Wu and Shela Wu walked over.</p>

      <p>“This is an incredible dish that could rival hamburg steak. I have been feeling excited all the while.”</p>

      <p>“This is the first time I tried making this dish too, I hope it turns out well.”</p>

      <p>I needed to check if it was cooked, would it suit the Forest’s Edge’s palette, and if this dish was harmful to the body.</p>

      <p>I had not been this nervous since the first time I let Donda Wu try steak and roast kiba.</p>

      <p>“Asuta, sorry for the wait!”</p>

      <p>Rimee Wu made it back before the cutlet turned cold.</p>

      <p>“Thank you.”</p>

      <p>I was speechless after that.</p>

      <p>Ryada Wu was here, and beside him were his brother Donda Wu and nephew Jiza Wu.</p>

      <p>Behind them were Shin Wu and Mida.</p>

      <p>“They just happened to be back from the forest! In the Wu clan village, Papa Donda and Jiza-nii are the most stubborn! So if they say it is tasty, it must be true!”</p>

      <p>Rimee Wu puffed out her chest proudly.</p>

      <p>I concealed my timidness and bowed at them:</p>

      <p>“I’m sorry for taking your time. Rimee Wu must have told you already, can you help me do a taste test?”</p>

      <p>“… What weird dish did you make this time?” Donda Wu said in a slurred voice: “Is this really kiba? It looks like a lump of mud to me.”</p>

      <p>“This is meat from the back of the kiba; it is covered with fuwano powder and kimyusu egg. I will cut and divide it by our numbers…”</p>

      <p>Not counting Ai Fa, Barcia, and me, there were six men and five women. Thus, I had to break the dish into 14 parts. This was a large 500 g piece of meat, so everyone could get a share.</p>

      <p>I split it down the middle and confirmed that it was completely cooked. There weren’t any red bits, and the entire thing had a pretty ivory white color. The juice from seeping out from the meat and the coating looked really appetizing.</p>

      <p>I divided the meat according to our numbers and sprinkled shiru fruit juice that acted as a replacement for lemon juice.</p>

      <p>My goal was to recreate pork cutlet, and the final product was flawless.</p>

      <p>But the problem would be the evaluation of Forest’s Edge denizens.</p>

      <p>“Please try some. No… This is my first time trying this dish; allow me to test it first.”</p>

      <p>I picked up a piece of “Kiba cutlet”.</p>

      <p>And put it into my mouth to chew. After feeling the crispy sensation, I felt a warm juice spread in my mouth.</p>

      <p>The thickness of the fuwano coating and cutlet’s texture were perfect too.</p>

      <p>It was probably due to the animal oil that the dish had a deep flavor.</p>

      <p>This was actually the first time I made cutlet with animal oil. But I heard that many street stalls used animal oil to deep fry their food, so I gave it a shot.</p>

      <p>I wondered if the excellent texture was because of the kiba meat or the kiba oil? The inside of the coating was full of the fragrance of meat and wasn’t too greasy. The strong flavor of the kiba meat became even thicker as it spread in my mouth.</p>

      <p>The sourness of the shiru fruit was very pleasing.</p>

      <p>I thought this cutlet was the most delicious cutlet.</p>

      <p>So I didn’t need to worry about how others thought about this.</p>

      <p>“I’m very satisfied with this. Everyone, please try some too.”</p>

      <p>The women picked up the skewers, while the hunters shoved the food into their mouths with their bare hands.</p>

      <p>“Uwah…”</p>

      <p>Ludo Wu exclaimed.</p>

      <p>He looked at me in surprise, but couldn’t speak as he was still eating.</p>

      <p>Rimee Wu opened her eyes wide.</p>

      <p>Leina Wu and Shela Wu had serious expressions.</p>

      <p>Donda Wu had a blank face.</p>

      <p>For some time, the kitchen was filled with the sound of eating.</p>

      <p>I couldn’t stay calm and looked back at Ai Fa.</p>

      <p>Ai Fa was chewing quietly with her eyes closed.</p>

      <p>“Erm, how is it…?”</p>

      <p>It was just a bite, but no one swallowed.</p>

      <p>And finally, Rimee Wu answered me:</p>

      <p>“It’s very yummy!”</p>

      <div class="imgBox">
        <img alt="Illustration" src="../Images/0008.png"/>
      </div>

      <p>Her big round eyes were sparkling.</p>

      <p>“This is the best dish that Asuta made! Ah, but… The vegetables are great too. I wonder which is better?”</p>

      <p>She fell into deep thought.</p>

      <p>I felt relieved by her cute reactions.</p>

      <p>Everyone then started to give their opinions.</p>

      <p>“This… is delicious.”</p>

      <p>“Yes, I was so surprised that I didn’t know what to say.”</p>

      <p>“That’s right, it’s the first time I tried something so tasty.”</p>

      <p>Shela Wu, Ditto Min Wu, Ludo Wu, and Barcia gave their compliments.</p>

      <p>Ryada Wu and Shin Wu listened quietly to them with calm faces.</p>

      <p>Leina Wu… closed her eyes and seemed to be in her own world.</p>

      <p>And then, I turned to Ai Fa.</p>

      <p>She was expressionless and closed her eyes just like Leina Wu.</p>

      <p>“… Erm, what do you think, Ai Fa?”</p>

      <p>Ai Fa opened her eyes and looked at me.</p>

      <p>Her gaze was incredibly peaceful.</p>

      <p>“It tastes great. This… might be the most delicious dish you have made.”</p>

      <p>My heart skipped a beat.</p>

      <p>I couldn’t hold back and leaned into Ai Fa’s ears and asked:</p>

      <p>“So I finally made a dish for Ai Fa that surpassed Hamburg steak?”</p>

      <p>Ai Fa’s face turned red, and she pouted to hide her expression:</p>

      <p>“… Hamburg steak is in a different category.”</p>

      <p>“It’s not in this category, huh.”</p>

      <p>I smiled cheekily.</p>

      <p>Ai Fa kicked my leg angrily and suddenly looked Mida’s way:</p>

      <p>“Hey, don’t cry, okay?”</p>

      <p>“Yes… Mida won’t cry…” Mida stood at the entrance of the kitchen with his face quivering: “Asuta… It’s very yummy…”</p>

      <p>I wanted to thank him, but a voice came from the opposite direction before I could say anything.</p>

      <p>“This… Of all the dishes I tried so far, I could feel the energy of the kiba the most from this dish.”</p>

      <p>I turned back.</p>

      <p>It was Jiza Wu.</p>

      <p>“I don’t understand why. Even though you used fuwano and kimyusu egg, ingredients that the denizens of Forest’s Edge would deem unnecessary… I could feel the strength of the kiba becoming a part of me.”</p>

      <p>“This might be due to the kiba oil. The coating around the meat absorbed a lot of kiba oil.” After explaining that to him, I grew tense: “Hence, it has more nutritional value than simply after grilling it. The only thing that worries me is the balance of the nutritional value…”</p>

      <p>Donda Wu said in a thunder-like voice: “Useless worries. Isn’t nutrition the source of strength?”</p>

      <p>I looked his way nervously:</p>

      <p>“Yes, but excessive medicine will be poisonous too. In my hometown, many people fall sick due to nutrition imbalance… And as I mentioned last night, organ illness in Genos might be caused by overly consuming luxurious food.”</p>

      <p>“Hmmp, it’s the illness of that aristocrat Pyschkurewuss, huh. Needless worry… What we need is powerful strength.”</p>

      <p>Donda Wu stared at me with his blue eyes:</p>

      <p>“The head of the Fou house also said that after eating the dishes their women cooked for them with your method, their entire body was filled with energy. It has nothing to do with taste… It was simply because the dishes are full of nutrition, correct?”</p>

      <p>“Indeed… The only seasoning used by the minor houses would be the salt in their jerky. Aside from jerky, I use salt, fruit wine that contains sugar, and vegetables like myam in my other dishes, which helps in building a healthy body.”</p>

      <p>“Telling us all that detail is pointless though. Are you saying that eating food with too much power might be poisonous to the denizens of the Forest’s Edge?”</p>

      <p>Donda Wu said in a strong tone, and I tried to recall:</p>

      <p>“Well… Hamburg steak does have its dangers. Like how eating hamburg steak would weaken one’s jaw, this dish is nutritionally unbalanced too. So in my hometown, we eat some vegetables and something sour alongside this dish.”</p>

      <p>“So we just need to eat it that way?”</p>

      <p>“That’s correct, I plan to do that too. When serving this dish for dinner, I plan to complement it with plenty of vegetables like tino, tarapa, and gigo. I added shiru fruit juice to stop the body from absorbing excessive oil.”</p>

      <p>I pondered as I answered:</p>

      <p>“Most importantly, we shouldn’t keep eating the same dish, just like hamburg steak. Even if we consume kiba oil, it won’t have any adverse effect on our body if we control the amount taken in by our body… That’s what I think.”</p>

      <p>“I see. In that case, your strength would become medicine and not poison. We need the power to fight against the nobles of Genos. Asuta of the Fa house…”</p>

      <p>“Y-Yes.”</p>

      <p>Donda Wu seldom addressed me by my name. He looked at me with a firm gaze as I unconsciously straightened my back:</p>

      <p>“Since you are a member of the Forest’s Edge, give us strength with the correct form of diet. That is your duty as a denizen of Forest’s Edge.”</p>

      <p>“… Yes, I understand.”</p>

      <p>I looked him straight in the eyes and nodded.</p>

      <p>Donda Wu also nodded and then said something stunning:</p>

      <p>“Then, permit me to give this order as the tribal chief of Forest’s Edge. Two nights later, cook dinner for the Wu clan main house. Not as a helper like last night, but prepare a meal fitting for that night with the help of the women.”</p>

      <p>“A meal that befits that night…?”</p>

      <p>Two nights later would be the eve of the conference with Pyschkurewuss.</p>

      <p>What would happen on that night?</p>

      <p>“… I will bring the seven former members of the Tsun clan to the conference venue. Zuro Tsun, Diga, Doddo, Aura, Zwei, Yamiel Lei, and Mida… So they will be gathered in the Wu clan village one day prior to the meeting. I command you to make dinner for the Wu clan main house members and the seven of them.”</p>

      <p>“Understood… I won’t have any complaints about your orders… But, what is…”</p>

      <p>“They are also a part of the Forest’s Edge. That is also true for the villain Zuro Tsun who will be facing the death penalty. These people… will be meeting the nobles three days later as members of the Forest’s Edge.”</p>

      <p>Donda Wu’s voice was very deep, filled with strength and dignity.</p>

      <p>“Mida and Yamiel Lei already tried your dishes. The other five only ate the food made by the women that were taught by you. What you have contributed to the Forest’s Edge, why are you doing business in the Post Station Town… These people need to understand further. That’s why I want them to try your cooking.”</p>

      <p>“… Yes.”</p>

      <p>An indescribable excitement boiled in my body.</p>

      <p>If I didn’t clench my fist, my body would start to tremble.</p>

      <p>“Let me make this clear, I don’t plan to pay you any remunerations. Since you are a member of the Forest’s Edge, show your conviction and pride to the other members of the Forest’s Edge. That’s how the Wu clan are.”</p>

      <p>“Understood. Thank you very much.”</p>

      <p>Donda Wu grunted, as if he was asking why I was thanking him. His hunter’s cape then fluttered in the air, as he turned and pushed aside Mida’s gigantic body before leaving the kitchen.</p>

      <p>Jiza Wu left right after him, and the place turned quiet.</p>

      <p>“… I don’t really understand. But Asuta’s cooking might let those lost souls recover their strength.”</p>

      <p>Ludo Wu said in a casual tone, as if he was chasing away the silence.</p>

      <p>I couldn’t tell Donda Wu’s true intentions. The only thing I could do was to complete my work as a member of the Forest’s Edge, which filled me with excitement.</p>

      <p>But, I wondered how they felt about the Forest’s Edge as kins of Zattsu Tsun, and the resolve they had to obtain to face the crimes committed by their family. I felt obligated to see this through to the end.</p>

      <p><i>If Donda Wu thinks my dishes would help others understand all that… I have to do my part.</i></p>

      <p>“… It will be fine.”</p>

      <p>A quiet voice reached my ear.</p>

      <p>I turned back and saw Ai Fa looking at me with determined eyes:</p>

      <p>“Asuta, you will be fine.”</p>

      <p>Ai Fa said again with strong blue eyes and an incredibly calm expression.</p>
