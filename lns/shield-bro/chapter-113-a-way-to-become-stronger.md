<br/>
A Method On Becoming Stronger<br/>
Rishia:"Fueeeeee~~~~~~~!"<br/>
A loud pathetic voice echoes throughout the warehouse.<br/>
And Rishia begins to run from me like an escaping rabbit.<br/>
She is demonstrating her judgement in a strange place.<br/>
Naofumi:"Catch her! Bring her back alive!"<br/>
Raphtalia:"What is with those strange lines!?"<br/>
Naofumi:"It’s nothing, I just wanted to say that phrase."<br/>
Firo:"Okay~!"<br/>
Naofumi:"Do-Don’t! Firo, I’m kidding! Catch her normally! Don’t use any power on your feet!"<br/>
Raphtalia:"The beak is no good either! Rishia-san will die!"<br/>
Oh shit, my joke may have turned into a tragic disaster. Let’s be careful.<br/>
Firo catches Rishia and carries her back on her shoulders.<br/>
Rishia is bahaving violently.<br/>
Rishia:"Please release me! I want to go back to my hometown! I want to return to papa and mama! Itsuki-samaaaaaaaaa~!"<br/>
Naofumi:"It was only a joke……"<br/>
Rishia:"About making me a slave?"<br/>
Naofumi:"That was the truth."<br/>
Rishia:"Wh-Why would you do that!?"<br/>
Naofumi:"My shield grants demons or slaves growth correction."<br/>
This is the biggest bottleneck.<br/>
The correction ability, multiplies with the demon and slave correction.<br/>
If I use this, Rishia should be remarkably stronger.<br/>
It would be good if there was something for companions.<br/>
Naofumi:"Do you want to try it out and see?"<br/>
Rishia:"Huh?"<br/>
Naofumi:"Rishia, cut your hair a little."<br/>
Rishia:"Sure……."<br/>
Rishia cuts her hair with a knife and hands it to me.<br/>
I let the shield absorb it.<br/>
Rishia:"Fue!?"<br/>
……Nothing happens.<br/>
As I thought, the Companion Shield didn’t unseal even though I got the hair from a companion.<br/>
Maybe it’s due to my relationship with Rishia not being very deep.<br/>
Naofumi:"Anyway, there is no choice other than becoming a demon or a slave."<br/>
Rishia:"Demon? I heard there is a secret dark medicine called Ghoul Powder. Shall I prepare it?"<br/>
Naofumi:"You……won’t you die?"<br/>
A companion with an immortal attribute huh?……Perhaps it might be strong due to removal of the human limiter.<br/>
As expected, my conscience would hurt if I made Rishia a zombie, I would like to avoid that.<br/>
I mean, does Rishia want to become strong to the point where she stops being human?<br/>
Naofumi:"Well, you are free to choose Rishia, though you won’t really receive any protection."<br/>
Rishia:"But……"<br/>
Naofumi:"Think carefully, what is necessary in order to become strong? You must greedily explore every single possibility. I am only showing you how."<br/>
Rishia:"……"<br/>
(Tlnote: Come to the dark side.)<br/>
Rishia was lost in thought and was at a loss.<br/>
It’s something you have to deal with yourself. There is no other way.<br/>
All I can do is supplement here and there.<br/>
Naofumi:"Well, since you are already level 68, and considering the speed of level ups, you wouldn’t receive that many benefits anyway, so it might not even be needed. But I still think that the growth potential is better than nothing."<br/>
It would be meaningful to do if we started at low levels.<br/>
Doesn’t this feel like a game?<br/>
From the start the high level guys were betrayed and killed. Or their growth was just bad.<br/>
Queen:"Logically speaking, would putting someone under Iwatani-sama’s care since level 1 be the case for the best growth?"<br/>
The queen asks me.<br/>
Naofumi:"That’s right. However, there is no method to return to Level 1."<br/>
Queen:"There is."<br/>
Naofumi:"……There is?"<br/>
Such a convenient thing exists?<br/>
If we could use it, it would be perfect for Rishia.<br/>
The problem with being level one is the amount of time and effort required to grow……Wouldn’t it be a problem to have her shoulder such a risk?<br/>
Queen:"Yes, originally it was used as punishment to reset the levels of adventurers who commit crimes. The effect of Class Up disappears simultaneously."<br/>
Ah, there is such a penalty.<br/>
Thinking about it carefully, it would be a menace to have high level adventurer becoming a criminal and threatening nobles.<br/>
The punishment for those people would be to make all of their effort in vain.<br/>
That’s certainly scary.<br/>
Naofumi:"Where is it done?"<br/>
Queen:"It can be performed at the Hourglass of the Dragon’s Era."<br/>
(Tlnote: What the hell is that thing, is it the box from Redshirts?)<br/>
Naofumi:"Is that so…… Rishia, what do you want?"<br/>
Rishia:"What do you mean?"<br/>
Naofumi:"I have a method that will help you become strong, I will only compel you to fight for me. You are free to choose your Class Up. Consider starting over again from level 1."<br/>
Rishia:"……Okay."<br/>
Naofumi:"Let’s see. The deadline on whether or not you want to return back to level one will be after the coming wave. There is no time now."<br/>
Due to there being no time, I am concerned for Rishia’s life if she would return back to level 1 then. It would be best to at least finish the wave.<br/>
Naofumi:"However, You only need to become a slave……Don’t run away! There are no restraints other than—Listen to me!"<br/>
Whenever I talk about slavery, Rishia tries to escape. What a troublesome fellow.<br/>
Naofumi:"I will not force you to do anything cruel, I just ask you to fight!"<br/>
Rishia:"Fueeee~~~~~~!"<br/>
Naofumi:"Fine, Rishia I’m just showing you a method to become stronger. What are you going to do?"<br/>
At my words Rishia’s eyes swim around.<br/>
Her answer is equivalent to whether or not she will become a slave.<br/>
……Is it Raphtalia?<br/>
Naofumi:"By the way, Queen, would it be possible to apply the same slave crest that you did to Bitch?"<br/>
Queen:"Yes, if that is what Iwatani-sama desires."<br/>
Naofumi:"Then that means. Although I will hold the reins, I swear that I won’t bind you to do anything."<br/>
Raphtalia:"……Unless you are being extremely selfish, he will not do anything. I can prove it."<br/>
Rishia:"Raphtalia-san……"<br/>
Firo:"Master. Is Firo being binded?"<br/>
Well, the words of Raphtalia and Firo that I have brainwashed will probably not reach Rishia.<br/>
Naofumi:"I won’t force you. If you hate it then we’ll leave it at that. Think about it until then."<br/>
The conversation ended here, and I turned to face the queen.<br/>
We’ll let Rishia’s matter slide for now, moving on to Trash abandoning the power of being a Seven Star Hero and staying in this country.<br/>
I wonder what the reason of doing something like that and not complaining.<br/>
That reminds me, the queen did say this to Trash before.<br/>
[Fight as a commander at the front line of this country against the wave, or lose your position and become an adventurer.]<br/>
From a different viewpoint, that’s telling to fight with the Power of the Hero of the Cane.<br/>
The bottleneck of this country, it’s general.<br/>
In the first place. That manner of speech was as if the whole world recognizes him as a hero, wouldn’t it be impossible to bind a hero?<br/>
For instance, if Melromarc lost the right to Trash who is a Seven Star Hero, Melromarc would then have to beg Trash to remain.<br/>
In short, that would mean recruiters coming from every country while Trash continues to stay here.<br/>
Was that parade meant to get them to leave?<br/>
However, seeing Trash’s attitude, it doesn’t seem like he will leave.<br/>
But why? Unlike me, he is probably not ignorant about this world’s common sense.<br/>
To be made an ice pickle, and a naked king, some thought must have went into it.<br/>
Does he like the queen that much?<br/>
He did say "A bastard like you wouldn’t understand your whole life."<br/>
Let’s change my thinking for a second.<br/>
There is a possibility that Trash is troubled by the appearance of scouts.<br/>
In short, he already doesn’t want to be a hero anymore.<br/>
When I look, I don’t see a cane in his hands.<br/>
It could simply be that he doesn’t have the will to fight anymore due to old age.<br/>
Oh well. Let’s fix and prepare our equipment for the wave now.<br/>
Naofumi:"I’m going to go and order weapons."<br/>
Queen:"Understood. I will entrust it to the weapon shop that Iwatani-sama relies on."<br/>
Rishia:"Ummm–"<br/>
Naofumi:"Hm? What’s wrong?"<br/>
Rishia has her hand in front of her chest…… I can’t see her expression, but her voice is full of determination.<br/>
Rishia:"I have decided……Please enslave me!"<br/>
Naofumi:"……Are you fine with it?"<br/>
She came to a conclusion quickly.<br/>
I thought that it would take longer, since it was Rishia.<br/>
Rishia:"Yes! I want to become strong!"<br/>
Rishia:"U…..Ku……"<br/>
The ceremony finished without any problems.<br/>
A High-class slave crest was engraved on Rishia’s chest.<br/>
Just like Bitch, after a while it turned invisible and won’t be seen again unless invoked.<br/>
A prohibition list appears in my view.<br/>
However, I take off all the checked items…… and, it was rejected.<br/>
Apparently, if I remove all the restrictions to activate the slave mark, it doesn’t work.<br/>
I’ll just check off a trifling item and be done with it.<br/>
……I’ll check down her ability to lie to me.<br/>
I also thought about the possibility of her doing something like Bitch.<br/>
Or in the case of her being a spy sent by Itsuki.<br/>
Though those possibilities were mostly gone when she selected to become a slave.<br/>
Rishia:"Haah……Haah……"<br/>
Naofumi:"Are you okay?"<br/>
Rishia:"Yes. I’m fine."<br/>
Naofumi:"I see, then that’s good."<br/>
While thinking that it’s wrong, I confirm Rishia’s Status.<br/>
Naofumi:"Tsu—"<br/>
Rishia:"What’s wrong?"<br/>
Naofumi:"N-Nothing, it’s fine. Don’t worry about it.<br/>
I was involuntarily at a loss for words.<br/>
What is this…….This is fatally low compared to Raphtalia, Firo, and I.<br/>
Although she is level 68, her stats are 1/5th that of Raphtalia’s.<br/>
I understand the reason Itsuki dismissed her as weak.<br/>
However, I will not abandon her. This is a chance for me to see just what I can do.<br/>
Are commoners the same?<br/>
Surely……These stats are the same as Rapthalia’s early period……<br/>
A peculiar trait is that all her stats are around the same.<br/>
There isn’t any weak or strong points.<br/>
However, due to it being originally low, the feeling now is that everything is lacking.<br/>
Are you really level 68?<br/>
If she didn’t earnestly accept the strengthening method, it would have truly been dangerous……<br/>
Naofumi:"Th-Then let’s go to the weapon store."<br/>
Rishia:"Okay!"<br/>
Raphtalia:"Sure."<br/>
Firo:"Go~"<br/>
After a long absence, we headed to see the old man at the weapon shop.<br/>
<br/>
