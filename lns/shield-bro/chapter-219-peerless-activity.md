I’m trying to increase my speed so the quality may drop slightly, but I’m working on it. Time taken: ~03 : 15 (rounding to 5 mins)<br/>
PS. If I take too long to repost a chapter then I’m probably editing it or working on the next chapter (or sleeping cos, you know, time zones).<br/>
Peerless Activity<br/>
"Now then…" (Naofumi)<br/>
Recently I’ve been practicing adding magic to my skills.<br/>
I think it will be good if I can use it as easily as breathing.<br/>
My weakness is that the magic consumption is huge so it’s hard to regulate.<br/>
Even just Air Strike Shield, sending 2 is the limit of my magic consumption.<br/>
Also, as far as I know, what changes depending on the skill is that the cooldown increases proportionately.<br/>
And it seems that if I add magic to the Portal Shield, the number of people I can transport increase. With the 6-person limit according to Motoyasu, I was able to transport 7 people because I unintentionally added magic. That was probably it.<br/>
I can’t control the part that I’m aware of though.<br/>
I can’t do it no matter what, huh…..<br/>
One way or another, the magic consumption is extreme. The natural recovery I have is troublesome.<br/>
Using Mana Potions are a waste so I have to save them. I use magic also when compounding.<br/>
But it’s good if I can use magic when making good things…. and as the Old Man said, it seems that listening to the ingredients is important too.<br/>
When I think about it, there’s no end.<br/>
Lately I’ve also been doing self-study when Rato isn’t teaching me Alchemy.<br/>
A part of my shield has an Elementary Alchemy Skill so I started to learn.<br/>
Letting the shield make it is fine but I know it’ll turn out better if I can make it myself.<br/>
"Naofumi-sama." (Atla)<br/>
"What is it?" (Naofumi)<br/>
"I feel like your accuracy has improved, but there are still tears?" (Atla)<br/>
Atla thrust at the weak points of the Air Strike Shield I fired.<br/>
For now, it seems that its strength has improved but it often breaks while being prodded.<br/>
"There, right." (Naofumi)<br/>
I can’t help feeling like it’s still incomplete somehow.<br/>
I think something more basic is insufficient.<br/>
However, it reached a stage where the Female Knight’s attacks became ineffective.<br/>
I proposed a contest with the Female Knight who had been training.<br/>
The Female Knight mastered the Peerless Transformation Sword Style.<br/>
Apparently because she could beat Ren, he happily became an opponent every day as well.<br/>
As expected, it seems that Ren’s skills are better normally than when he’s been corroded by the Curse Series.<br/>
Since long ago, the frequency of being hit by the Female Knight’s attacks was high.<br/>
Well, I specialise in enduring. Even when I’m engulfed by anger, receiving the opponent’s attacks is insignificant.<br/>
I think if I face being hit like this then it’ll probably collapse.<br/>
It’s fine if that’s the case.<br/>
I want to test how well the Prison will work in actual combat on the Female Knight.<br/>
"A fight with Iwatani-dono, huh, then I’ll be going at it seriously." (Female Knight)<br/>
"To overtake me and bypass my defence, I won’t less you pass that point." (Naofumi)<br/>
"Well then, it’s fine to see if you can take this! Multilayer Crumble Attack!" (Female Knight)<br/>
The Female Knight’s special skill that bypassed defence faced me.<br/>
The first strike warded off the shield, and the second strike changed direction to my forearm.<br/>
The third strike repeatedly intersected, mixing together at high frequencies and when I was about to receive it, I followed the flow of her body and struck.<br/>
"Shield Prison!" (Naofumi)<br/>
Without overlooking my chance, I materialised the Prison to trap the Female Knight as she focused her consciousness on her attack.<br/>
"Ku….But―" (Female Knight)<br/>
The imprisoned Female Knight attacked with a bang.<br/>
However…the cage gave no sign of breaking.<br/>
I think the sound reverberated for around three minutes but before long, it became silent.<br/>
And then….Five minutes later.<br/>
"What’s with my efforts? The style I finally learnt was also destroyed….." (Female Knight)<br/>
She muttered complaints.<br/>
"What are you so down about?" (Naofumi)<br/>
When I called out to her, she suddenly came to her senses and glared at me with determined eyes.<br/>
"Pft! You may have beat me this time but I won’t let you next time so prepare yourself. I’ve received full mastery but I’ve only used the basics." (Female Knight)<br/>
"Is that so." (Naofumi)<br/>
It seems the Female Knight doesn’t have the ability to strike the weak points like Alta can.<br/>
So next is Rishia.<br/>
"Rishia." (Naofumi)<br/>
"W-what is it?" (Rishia)<br/>
I call Rishia, who been making progress with her mood change lately, to test it out. [T/N: So no more Fue?]<br/>
This guy, she’s levelled up and has gotten considerably strong.<br/>
"I’m going to trap you in the Shield Prison for a bit so can you try to break out?" (Naofumi)<br/>
"Right….I understand." (Rishia)<br/>
Rishia takes out and readies her sword, and I imprison her like the Female Knight.<br/>
"Ei!" (Rishia)<br/>
It took her around three hits. Her’s was a relatively quick destruction.<br/>
As expected, Rishia is stronger than the Female Knight.<br/>
Was it only….the status difference?<br/>
I don’t understand the disparity of the Peerless Transformation Style.<br/>
"Speaking of which, what kind of School is the Peerless Transformation Style? I can’t tell from just the legends so please teach me." (Naofumi)<br/>
"Ah, Yes…. Is what I heard from Master okay?" (Rishia)<br/>
"Yeah, I just heard from the Old Hag about how it’s a famous School that rivals the heroes so it’s fine." (Naofumi_<br/>
I heard that there was a legend that matched the Four Saint Heroes and the Seven Star Heroes but I don’t know the actual circumstances so I’d like to hear.<br/>
"Lets see….In Master’s story, it seems the origin was an adventurer wanted to overcome danger without relying on the heroes so he founded the School." (Rishia)<br/>
Without relying on the heroes, I see…. well in this world, whenever something happens then they summon heroes or rely on the Seven Star Heroes, or at least that’s the image i get.<br/>
So it’s a School made from searching for a method to become stronger without relying on those heroes.<br/>
Thinking about it normally, to leave the world to the Four Saint Heroes and the Seven Star Heroes, only 11 people, is an act of sheer madness.<br/>
Despite the difference between being able and being unable to do something, having people who will think of a solution by themselves is more natural.<br/>
In addition, to leave your own fate in outsiders summoned from a different world or something….<br/>
No, they probably had no choice but to leave it to them ability-wise, but there were people who couldn’t consent because of that.<br/>
"To be able to handle the elements is the foundation, skills come after that." (Rishia)<br/>
"I see…" (Naofumi)<br/>
"I was able to handle the elements and so I ended my absence-of-leave. The other techniques was one part but they were the application of the original School." (Female Knight)<br/>
"Didn’t Master also praise you for achieving mastery?." (Rishia)<br/>
"Yes, but…. Teacher has yet to teach me about the inner workings, isn’t Raphtalia working on those hidden purposes now? Rishia, I also saw her teaching you things that I don’t know." (Female Knight)<br/>
"Th-that’s right, isn’t it." (Rishia)<br/>
"Isn’t it obvious that the continuation time of Peerless Activity differs too much?" (Female Knight)<br/>
"Peerless Activity?" (Naofumi)<br/>
"Ah, I only use it during the instant when attacking Iwatani-dono or avoiding. So to speak, it’s similar to handling protection magic. Rishia excels at maintaining that activity for a long time. If I try to imitate her, I can probably only hold it for a minute." (Female Knight)<br/>
"Hmmm…." (Naofumi)<br/>
A technique that the Female Knight can only use for an instant, Rishia can invoke that for a long time?<br/>
It’s that. The so-called ‘Overdrive’ skill or attack in games.<br/>
Giving a massive Power Up for a certain time but it’s consumption is extreme or something, so Rishia has that kind of attack.<br/>
Or rather, was Rishia able to maintain it for a long time because her disposition was good?<br/>
The Female Knight who used it economically and the Rishia who could use it for a long duration.<br/>
It seems the Female Knight had a weaker effect as well.<br/>
Actually, I already succeeded in making the Female Knight’s special attack become powerless and unable to break open the Prison.<br/>
That Ren will probably be surprised. If he knew that I neutralised the Female Knight who was stronger than him.<br/>
I’m not going to tell him though.<br/>
Either way, the Female Knight can use it so I can probably use it as well.<br/>
Hypothetically, even if I can’t use it, I should be able to apply it as long as I understand the principle.<br/>
The problem is that I didn’t realise that that technique was being used until now.<br/>
I thought it was natural to have the magic swell up only during the instant of attack.<br/>
Actually, in all the battles I’ve seen, the attackers use magic instantaneously.<br/>
In that case, was magic a separate component to that?<br/>
Lately, there are times where I feel a discrepancy when I talk to Rishia or the Female Knight, and Atla.<br/>
It’s when they start talking about ‘the elements’.<br/>
I don’t really understand but, I’ll observe these three more attentively.<br/>
"I always worry about if my strength has reached its peak. But I can’t lose to this level! Rishia! Practice with me!" (Female Knight)<br/>
"O-okay!" (Rishia)<br/>
And so, the Female Knight started training with Rishia.<br/>
"Atla, did you understand what she meant?" (Naofumi)<br/>
"Um…If I’m not mistaken, Eclaire builds up essence inside during the instant she attacks or avoids. I think she was talking about that. Shall I imitate it?" (Atla)<br/>
"Please." (Naofumi)<br/>
"Then I’ll be starting." (Atla)<br/>
After Atla built up her strength, she jumped towards me.<br/>
Fast! Her speed is several times more than her usual speed.<br/>
"This is… I’m sure the body and spirit doesn’t possess this." (Atla)<br/>
And then she faced me and fired a hit.<br/>
Gu…. I didn’t dodge Atla’s attack that disregarded defence and was injured.<br/>
There was a slight struggle in my body.<br/>
I see, this is really brutal indeed.<br/>
Or rather, Atla really is a genius to be able to copy this simply from watching.<br/>
Already, she can’t be stopped by the Female Knight.<br/>
And so we trained with this kind of feeling.<br/>
<br/>
