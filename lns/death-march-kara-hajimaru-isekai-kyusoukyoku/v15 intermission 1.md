15-Intermission 1: Hayato Masaki<br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
※ This is from Hero Hayato's point of view<br/>
<br/>
"Looks like there's a time limit for God Parion to connect worlds. I have to go soon."<br/>
<br/>
Gentle light falls from the heaven, wrapping me.<br/>
<br/>
My body floats in the air and my view is swallowed by the light while my friends and Satou are watching.<br/>
I could dimly hear Rin's sorrowful voices calling me.<br/>
<br/>
--Sorry, Rin.<br/>
<br/>
I apologize to my friends in my mind.<br/>
<br/>
『My gratitude, Hero.』<br/>
<br/>
I heard a voice mixed with noise, like a badly tuned radio, inside my mind.<br/>
This cute childish voice is of God Parion.<br/>
<br/>
She conveys her thought with flowing images.<br/>
<br/>
Looks like she's thanking me for subjugating the demon lord.<br/>
I regret that I can't see the young goddess inside the whitened view.<br/>
<br/>
『Parting, Apologize.』<br/>
<br/>
--Don't worry about it. I'm the one who chose to do it.<br/>
<br/>
I shook my head at God Parion's apologetic thought.<br/>
<br/>
『Great Happiness, Future, Blessing.』<br/>
<br/>
--Yeah, I'll find so much happiness so that Rin and the others I left behind won't have to worry.<br/>
<br/>
Hearing me, the young goddess sent a smiling image at me.<br/>
That's right, children gotta have to smile!<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
◇<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
"This place is--"<br/>
<br/>
I was standing on a stone pavement when I noticed.<br/>
<br/>
--The precincts of a shrine?<br/>
<br/>
Right! I was in this shrine when I got summoned.<br/>
<br/>
"So I've come back...."<br/>
<br/>
I run down the stairs.<br/>
<br/>
I passed through a vermilion arc gate, arriving at a gray road that smelled of exhaust fumes.<br/>
<br/>
"Kya"<br/>
<br/>
I heard a girl's voice on the side.<br/>
Looks like she was surprised because I rushed in.<br/>
<br/>
"My bad--Tachibana!"<br/>
"--Eh? Masaki-kun?"<br/>
<br/>
I found my childhood friend with her loli face--Tachibana Yumiri and I immediately hugged her slender childish body.<br/>
<br/>
"No, w-wait, Hayato-chan! Please do this at a more romantic spot."<br/>
<br/>
When I heard my panicking childhood friend's voice, I couldn't hold back my nostalgia and ended up weeping.<br/>
<br/>
"What? Are you hurt anywhere? Heey, Hayato-chan."<br/>
"Yumiri Yumiri, I'm back. I've come back."<br/>
<br/>
Yumiri gently hugged this unseemly me back even while being at a loss.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
◇<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
"Here you go, Pekari. You like it right."<br/>
"T-thank you. Ah to think I could drink Pekari again--"<br/>
<br/>
Yumiri offered a handkerchief as I got in tears again when I saw the sport drink she gave.<br/>
I feel that Yumiri's cheeks look red, maybe because of the hug earlier.<br/>
<br/>
"--Huh?"<br/>
"What is it now."<br/>
<br/>
Yumiri frowns quizzically.<br/>
<br/>
"Why are you in sailor uniform?"<br/>
<br/>
From what I remember, this guy doesn't have a cosplaying hobby.<br/>
<br/>
"You're really! We were together at the school earlier."<br/>
<br/>
--Earlier?<br/>
<br/>
I stare at Yumiri's eyes.<br/>
<br/>
"W-what."<br/>
<br/>
Yumiri crosses her arms in front of her body, taking a guarding pose.<br/>
She was shaken enough that she began to act strangely, but I only noticed that after I got home.<br/>
<br/>
There was something more important for me at this time.<br/>
<br/>
"What year and date are now!"<br/>
"He?"<br/>
<br/>
I caught the puzzled Yumiri's shoulders and asked.<br/>
<br/>
"Tell me!"<br/>
"U-un.... It's the third of March 2013, the time too? It's 12:15."<br/>
<br/>
I don't remember the time, but there's no mistake about the date.<br/>
<br/>
This was the day I got summoned.<br/>
<br/>
"I thought Time magic didn't exist...."<br/>
"Hey, didn't you say that you'd graduated from chuunibyou in your middle school days? Did it recur again?"<br/>
<br/>
Yumiri who heard my muttering said something, but I couldn't afford to mind that as I touch my face all around.<br/>
<br/>
"Are you really alright?"<br/>
"Mirror! Do you have a mirror?"<br/>
"I do though?"<br/>
<br/>
I look at the mirror Yumiri handed to me worryingly.<br/>
<br/>
--It's the high schooler me.<br/>
<br/>
"Huh? Come to think of it, why are you wearing a suit? Interview for a part-time job?"<br/>
"It's a long story--"<br/>
<br/>
I talked to Yumiri about the other world while feeling pleasant with the surprise from the young goddess.<br/>
At first Yumiri didn't believe me at all, but she consented after I crushed a coin into four parts with my fingers.<br/>
<br/>
My strength had been badly lowered compared to when I was another world's hero since I couldn't use my skill here, but there was still enough unreasonable strength remaining for me to do that.<br/>
I feel that I probably could join into the circle of top athletes if I just trained a bit.<br/>
<br/>
"Hmm, you went through a lot. And, did you leave lovers or wives in the other world?"<br/>
<br/>
Her words were light.<br/>
Looks like she didn't completely believe it.<br/>
<br/>
Well, whatever.<br/>
<br/>
I also would have laughed someone if they told me something like this.<br/>
<br/>
"Nah, I didn't have any lover nor wife--"<br/>
<br/>
--The one that's always been in my mind.<br/>
<br/>
Yumiri blushed as I stared her.<br/>
<br/>
Let's not talk about Princess Arisa.<br/>
<br/>
"Sorry, Yumiri, I have to go home and say 『I'm home』 to my little sister."<br/>
<br/>
When I said that with an earnest look, Yumiri's shoulders dropped down a bit for some reason, but then she waved her hand and said, "Bye bye" while looking astonished.<br/>
<br/>
"Un, see you tomorrow."<br/>
<br/>
My cheeks loosened from Yumiri's farewell.<br/>
<br/>
"Yea, see you."<br/>
"Bye~"<br/>
<br/>
Yumiri looked satisfied when I replied her.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
◇<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
"Ichirou-nii's friend?"<br/>
<br/>
A beautiful woman who feels similar to Satou is looking at me suspiciously.<br/>
<br/>
"Yes, I'm here to deliver a letter he's entrusted to me."<br/>
"How old are you?"<br/>
"Tw--seventeen."<br/>
<br/>
I almost said my age when I was in the other world.<br/>
<br/>
"Then you knew Ichi-nii when you were seven?"<br/>
<br/>
--What does she mean?<br/>
<br/>
"No, it was two years ago."<br/>
<br/>
Her expression disappeared from her face when I said that.<br/>
<br/>
"Really--"<br/>
<br/>
The beauty whose expression changed into that of a noh mask said, "Go home", and turned back into the entranceway.<br/>
<br/>
"P-please wait. At least please take letter."<br/>
"If you want to prank someone, do it somewhere else--"<br/>
<br/>
She said that with a cold voice, and then she slammed the entranceway's door right before my face.<br/>
<br/>
"Oh my? Do you need something here?"<br/>
<br/>
When I turned back at the voice behind, there was a middle aged woman who looked similar to Satou, holding a shopping bag.<br/>
<br/>
"Are you Suzuki Ichirou's mother?"<br/>
"Yes, I am?"<br/>
<br/>
After introducing myself, I told her the same thing I said earlier.<br/>
<br/>
"Don't you know that our son went missing 10 years ago?"<br/>
"10 years ago? He left me a business card though--"<br/>
<br/>
I hold out a business card that Satou gave me.<br/>
<br/>
"I think you're mistaking him with someone else. That child went missing when he was attending an university. He shouldn't be working anywhere."<br/>
<br/>
I recalled, the words "The world might be different" that Satou said when I listened to her.<br/>
After apologizing to her for the clamor, I left the Suzuki house.<br/>
<br/>
A little while after leaving Suzuki house, something that I didn't notice earlier hit me.<br/>
<br/>
"--Why didn't Satou's family even consider the possibility of him surviving?"<br/>
<br/>
The two didn't seem like they hated Satou.<br/>
Yet the two didn't seem to even consider the possibility of Satou being alive at all.<br/>
<br/>
I hesitated if I should talk to them again, but for some reason, I ended up only putting Satou's letter inside a nearby postbox and went home.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
◇<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
"Hayato-nii, what a' you doin'?"<br/>
<br/>
My little sister Aika who had just turned three talked to me clumsily.<br/>
<br/>
"I'm making a doghouse."<br/>
"Do'! Keep do'?"<br/>
<br/>
Aika gleefully asked while climbing my back.<br/>
<br/>
She's adorable today too.<br/>
Truly an angel.<br/>
<br/>
"Right. We should keep one."<br/>
"Waai"<br/>
<br/>
Aika happily jumps up and down.<br/>
I quickly supported Aika as she was about to fall from my back and lowered her on the ground.<br/>
<br/>
"Ride on do' back!"<br/>
"I see I see. Then we gotta keep a big dog."<br/>
"Aye!"<br/>
<br/>
Looks like my image library will get additional pics of my pretty little sister riding on a dog's back.<br/>
Aika was watching me making the doghouse for a while, but then she dozed off halfway through so I let her sleep in the sofa.<br/>
<br/>
"--Alright, complete."<br/>
<br/>
Lastly, I nailed a nameplate written with word, Satou, on the doghouse.<br/>
<br/>
This nameplate was sent to me from Suzuki family.<br/>
It was probably because I sent a letter of apology to Satou's family the following day.<br/>
<br/>
I got a message from Satou through his family's letter.<br/>
Dunno why, but he asked me to make a dog house and put this nameplate on it.<br/>
<br/>
"Well it's that guy's request, so this must have some meaning to it."<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
I muttered while stretching myself.<br/>
<br/>
I clap my hand to brush off wood chips and dust. <br/>
<br/>
"Hayato-chan, are you inside?"<br/>
<br/>
I heard my childhood friend Yumiri's voice from the entranceway.<br/>
<br/>
After our reunion recently, she came to call me "Hayato-chan" like she used before, instead of "Masaki-kun."<br/>
I got thoroughly made fun of in the school, but since it somehow felt like I regained my lost youth, I gladly enjoyed it and then it waned before I knew it.<br/>
<br/>
"I'm here!"<br/>
<br/>
I called Yumiri from the garden, thinking of bragging the doghouse to her.<br/>
<br/>
At that time, a presence appeared behind me.<br/>
<br/>
"Hello, Hayato-sama. It's been awhile."<br/>
<br/>
I turned back and saw a man who looked like he was just before his thirty coming out of the doghouse.<br/>
<br/>
"Don't tell me, you're Satou?"<br/>
"Yes, it's been a while isn't it."<br/>
<br/>
It's my friend with the same atmosphere, but aged.<br/>
I don't know how he crossed worlds, but Satou could probably do it indiscreetly.<br/>
<br/>
"Thank you for coming. I'm happy to see you again."<br/>
"Yes, me too."<br/>
<br/>
It's only been several months for me, but it's probably around 10 years for Satou.<br/>
<br/>
"Satou, what happened to that world--"<br/>
<br/>
I asked my friend's business while exchanging reunion hugs with him.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
◆<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
"Ha-Hayato-chan? Onee-san thinks BL is bad for you!"<br/>
<br/>
Yumiri who saw us exchanging reunion hugs said some preposterous remark.<br/>
<br/>
"Would you happen to be Hayato-san's elder sister?"<br/>
"N-no, I'm Tachibana Yumiri, Masaki-kun's childhood friend and classmate."<br/>
<br/>
Satou shrewdly talked to Yumiri.<br/>
He murmured, "Tachibana" when she heard Yumiri's name.<br/>
<br/>
"Sometimes ago, Hayato-san really helped me when he picked up a briefcase with a large sum of money in it."<br/>
"Briefcase?"<br/>
"Yes, that's right. If I couldn't find that briefcase--"<br/>
<br/>
Looks like Satou is fit to be a first-rate fraud.<br/>
Yumiri who got deceived in the blink of an eye said, "It's nothing important, I'll talk to you at school tomorrow", and went home.<br/>
<br/>
"I'm glad we cleared the misunderstanding."<br/>
"You bet yea."<br/>
<br/>
I ask Satou again while sighing in relief.<br/>
<br/>
"And, did something happen to that world?"<br/>
<br/>
--I won't spare anything if my power is needed.<br/>
<br/>
"Arisa asked me for something."<br/>
"My honey--sorry."<br/>
<br/>
Oops, it should be about time for her to become Satou's wife and have children.<br/>
<br/>
"No, you're free to call her what you like."<br/>
<br/>
Satou is all smiles like usual.<br/>
For some reason, he's drinking the cheap instant coffee with great relish.<br/>
<br/>
"And, what do you need? Ask me anything if it's something I can help."<br/>
"Then, could you guide me to the drugstore or supermarket nearby?"<br/>
<br/>
--Drugstore?<br/>
<br/>
"Arisa said that she wanted to eat instant food, thus I'm here to buy various kinds."<br/>
<br/>
--Haa?<br/>
<br/>
This was the time when my jaw dropped.<br/>
Who would have guessed that he was teleportating between worlds, which even gods couldn't do, just to buy instant food!<br/>
<br/>
"You never change...."<br/>
<br/>
While sighing, I lead my friend to the city in order to fulfill his wish.<br/>
<br/>
"You even had a driver's license."<br/>
"Yes, I couldn't exchange that thing with money if I didn't have an ID card."<br/>
<br/>
Satou got his fund by selling a mysterious object made of gold in a precious metal purchasing shop.<br/>
After the exchange, we went into a back alley and his appearance changed to the 15 year old Satou I'm familiar with.<br/>
<br/>
"The effect of illusion magic is truly short in this world isn't it."<br/>
<br/>
Apparently, it's not that 15 years have passed in that world, he just had it prepared to match his appearance on the driver's license.<br/>
After buying several boxes of instant foods, Satou went back to the other world satisfyingly.<br/>
<br/>
Afterward, he occasionally came to visit once every several months.<br/>
<br/>
I was surprised when he brought along Rin who looked and got younger, but right now she's got along well with Yumiri and Aika.<br/>
Satou prepared her family register in this world.<br/>
His cheat performance is really dependable like always.<br/>
<br/>
"Satou, how is the world over there?"<br/>
"Yes well, it's really peaceful like this world."<br/>
<br/>
I asked Satou while watching him playing with my little sister in the garden.<br/>
<br/>
"Hey, did you do something to that?"<br/>
<br/>
The TV was full of news about wars and disasters when I got back to this world, but they decreased every time Satou came visiting.<br/>
<br/>
Satou only smiled and laughed without answering me back.<br/>
<br/>
Geez, looks like Satou is Satou no matter the world.<br/>
<br/>
