Chapter 132: Acquaintances<br/>
I don a cloak and begin to walk around the town.<br/>
As expected, the damages are quite severe. The effects of the Spirit turtle are still clearly visible.<br/>
There is also clear signs of damage caused by the onslaught of familiars.<br/>
As I’m walking, I arrive at a familiar store.<br/>
Good, this building is still standing.<br/>
There aren’t really any visible damages. The building seems to be conducting business as usual.<br/>
I walk into the store… The Old Man’s store.<br/>
"Welcome." (Old Man)<br/>
"I’m happy you’re safe." (Naofumi)<br/>
"That voice… boy, is that you?"<br/>
I take off the hood of the cloak and greet the old man.<br/>
Luckily, he doesn’t have any visible injuries.<br/>
"Why are you wearing such a suspicious cloak?" (Old Man)<br/>
"I don’t want to stand out." (Naofumi)<br/>
"Well, you have become quite famous, lad." (Old Man)<br/>
Yep, that’s my main problem right now.<br/>
I’m not like Itsuki. When people call out my name in praise, it sends shivers down my spine.<br/>
I don’t think popularity is bad in general, but having the people of this country praise me doesn’t make me feel good at all.<br/>
And right now, I have too many things that I have to do. I can’t waste my time dealing with these people.<br/>
"Well I guess having people flock around you would get annoying after a while." (Old Man)<br/>
"By the look of it, this store hasn’t really been effected." (Naofumi)<br/>
"Pretty much. I was able to drive off all the monsters that came this way." (Old Man)<br/>
"Good job on that."<br/>
"I saw it. You stood on that monsters neck and suddenly started bleeding, but then a large thing came out of the ground and killed it." (Old Man)<br/>
"You saw that?" (Naofumi)<br/>
I guess it is quite a feat to be able to focus on that while being swarmed by monsters.<br/>
I wonder just how strong the Old Man is.<br/>
I don’t really feel like finding out either.<br/>
"I was on the battlefield, so I was able to witness it: your power." (Old Man)<br/>
"I see. Old Man, What level are you?" (Naofumi)<br/>
"I have long since given up on becoming an adventurer. Please don’t pry any further." (Old Man)<br/>
My question was denied. Really, what level is he?<br/>
He’s at least done Class Up once, and he is on a level where he can fight on par with the Spirit Turtle’s Familiars.<br/>
… at least 70, probably.<br/>
"You’ve been through a lot since you first came here. When I first saw you, I couldn’t believe you would be able to change the world." (Old Man)<br/>
"I was of the same opinion." (Naofumi)<br/>
I casually converse with this Old Man. He really has done a lot for me.<br/>
The Old Man looks around me intently.<br/>
"Is it just you, today?" (Old Man)<br/>
"Yeah" (Naofumi)<br/>
"What happened?" (Old Man)<br/>
"Rafatalia is currently working on a different job, and Rishia has gone hunting with Firo." (Naofumi)<br/>
"What about you, boy?" (Old Man)<br/>
"The city is quite damaged, so the castle has put all of its manpower into helping rebuild. Because of that, royal weapon production has been ordered to cease." (Naofumi)<br/>
"I guess they’ve got no choice…" (Old Man)<br/>
"Yep." (Naofumi)<br/>
I can’t ask him to make me anything right now. For now, I guess I should get his advice.<br/>
I’ll probably need something later. I’ll have to think about it.<br/>
"How’s the store going?" (Naofumi)<br/>
"A calamity of this scale just happened. Everyone is rushing out to buy weapons." (Old Man)<br/>
"So Business is booming." (Naofumi)<br/>
"Yeah, I’ve sold so much that my store room is almost completely empty." (Old Man)<br/>
"Isn’t that just peachy." (Naofumi)<br/>
"Yeah but… for people without any passion for weapons to just go out and buy them in a panic… It feels a little sad." (Old Man)<br/>
There’s no helping it. The town was almost destroyed. It’s not surprising that people with no skill are rushing to obtain armaments.<br/>
It’s probably like that. In preparation for the apocalypse, people are frantically looking for weapons and armor to increase their chances of survival.<br/>
From what I’ve seen, there’s been no looting yet. They seem to be heading in a positive direction.<br/>
"Is that all you needed today?" (Old Man)<br/>
"Oh, about that…" (Naofumi)<br/>
I’m debating whether or not to ask him about arming the new slaves.<br/>
The Queen has already approved my proposal, so I can probably get some second-hand equipment from the army, but getting any more than that will be logistically difficult in this time of crisis.<br/>
These items are quite important. I don’t want to risk it on second-hand goods.<br/>
There’s also a problem of upgrades and maintenance. Well, first I should tell the Old Man the Situation.<br/>
"I received some land from the Queen, I’m planning to start a business there." (Naofumi)<br/>
The Old Man will be really helpful in procuring equipment, and various other tasks. I’ll try recruiting him.<br/>
"So what relation does that have to me?" (Old Man)<br/>
"I’ve come to scout you." (Naofumi)<br/>
When starting up a new town, iron goods are essential<br/>
Plus, I’m already certain of his skill. I can place my hopes on his equipment.<br/>
"I had kind of figured it out. But I have this store." (Old Man)<br/>
"I know. I won’t force you or anything. Perhaps… I may send someone to you to ask to be your disciple." (Naofumi)<br/>
"Ah, so it’s like that… I got it, boy… Though my skills aren’t that great, I’ll try to train anyone you send me." (Old Man)<br/>
Okay, I’ve got some approval.<br/>
If there’s a skilled slave, maybe I can send him to learn under the Old Man.<br/>
After that, I just have to buy the equipment. I don’t plan to make the Old Man teach for free, either.<br/>
"Don’t be so modest. I’m confident in your skill." (Naofumi)<br/>
"Ha, I’m working my hardest to meet your expectations." (Old Man)<br/>
"Next is… Oh right, do you have any information about the other vendors?" (Naofumi)<br/>
"Ah, right. The Magic shop collapsed, didn’t it?" (Old Man)<br/>
So that big magic shop collapsed… It was on the Castle Town’s main street. It was also on the side of town the Turtle attacked from.<br/>
…<br/>
"Were the employees Okay?" (Naofumi)<br/>
"Yeah, the owner escaped without a scratch. The problem is that the Store is now gone. She’s currently taking refuge in Ryut Village." (Old Man)<br/>
"I see…" (Naofumi)<br/>
"The Medicine Shop has gotten quite busy." (Old Man)<br/>
"There were quite a few injured in the disaster, so that business is thriving as well." (Naofumi)<br/>
"Something like that. But the clothing stores seem to be losing business." (Old Man)<br/>
Fumu… So no one I knew dies.<br/>
I don’t have to go around the whole town to investigate.<br/>
"Well, I’m starting a business, so please give my regards to the other vendors. The place is…" (Naofumi)<br/>
I tell the Old Man about my land. I also talk about the village that it will be centered around.<br/>
Right now, The Hero of the Shield is popular. There may be some people willing to jump on the bandwagon.<br/>
It would be best if I could have some people that I trust among them.<br/>
The village isn’t exceptionally far from the Castle Town anyways.<br/>
"Got it, Got it. Everyone was worried about you anyways, my boy. Some people may be willing to go with you." (Old Man)<br/>
"I have a debt to those people, so I’ll give them some preferential treatment. Old Man, if you ever feel like moving, you can come any time." (Naofumi)<br/>
"Got it, Got it." (Old Man)<br/>
And with that, the Old Man casually avoided the topic. However his gaze seems to be serious.<br/>
"You have something else to ask, don’t you?" (Old Man)<br/>
"You can tell?" (Naofumi)<br/>
"Boy, every time you come here, you come with a mountain of requests." (Old Man)<br/>
"I see…" (Naofumi)<br/>
I don’t really want to show it. I take off the cloak and show him my armor.<br/>
The Old Man gives a look of understanding.<br/>
"It was an intense battle. It held up well." (Naofumi)<br/>
The Barbarian armor is in a terrible shape. Its defense has also dropped considerably.<br/>
It’s autonomous repair function did not activate at all. I wondered if it was beyond repair, so I took it to the Old Man.<br/>
"The Core Piece is not very damaged, but… everything else is gone case." (Old Man)<br/>
"Can you fix it?" (Naofumi)<br/>
"Hmm… It’s not like it can’t be repaired but… that depends on the materials. It will also cost a bit." (Old Man)<br/>
"Is that so?" (Naofumi)<br/>
"Will you put in a request? I got some rare materials from that Monster for cheap." (Old Man)<br/>
They have more of those parts than they can handle.<br/>
It seems that a large quantity of materials were set aside for me, but still the turtle has way too many materials for the town to get rid of all of them.<br/>
"I am overstocked on those materials. If you pay a little money, I can make a lot of stuff for you." (Old Man)<br/>
"Is that alright with you?" (Naofumi)<br/>
"Don’t worry, if it’s a request from you, I’ll definitely carry it out. I also want to experiment with unknown materials." (Old Man)<br/>
"…" (Naofumi)<br/>
This man’s generosity towards me… it seems to be endless.<br/>
His skill level is also on a level I can respect. To be honest, I really want him to come work in my village.<br/>
Right now I am just starting out. Once I’ve finished setting up the village, I’ll invite him again.<br/>
"Well, in a matter of priorities, I guess the armor comes first… After that comes making a shield. You won’t necessarily lose any money on that one." (Old Man)<br/>
"Yeah, worse comes to worst, I can just copy it, and re-sell the original." (Naofumi)<br/>
"So you do get it. Well, please leave your armor here." (Old Man)<br/>
"Understood." (Naofumi)<br/>
I take off my wreck-of-an-armor and hand it over to the Old Man.<br/>
"As for the core piece, I think you should hold onto it." (Old Man)<br/>
"Is that alright?" (Naofumi)<br/>
"I’ll embed the core in later. You can pay for it at that point in time." (Old Man)<br/>
"Thanks."(Naofumi)<br/>
"Boy, what do you plan to do while waiting for your armor?" (Old Man)<br/>
"I think I’ll borrow a second-hand one from the castle. Or maybe I’ll wear the Costume." (Naofumi)<br/>
That costume does have some useful features attached. If only the appearance could be changed…<br/>
Rishia seems to be forming a strange affinity for it, but… that’s not my problem.<br/>
"Anyways, I’ll leave it to you." (Naofumi)<br/>
"Got it!" (Old Man)<br/>
My negotiations with the Old Man are complete. I put the cloak back on and leave the store.<br/>
