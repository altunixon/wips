I feel for those bandits...... <br/>
Chapter 60! <br/>
 <br/>
Devilry <br/>
 <br/>
Several days later. <br/>
Firo is pulling the wagon across the highway, while looking like an ordinary Philo Rial. We are mostly trying to ignore villages and towns. <br/>
Repeatedly camping out at night. <br/>
We're almost at the border. <br/>
 <br/>
"Gueeee!" <br/>
 <br/>
Firo cries in alarm. <br/>
Is it an enemy!? <br/>
The second princess and I hide in the straw to observe. <br/>
 <br/>
"Hehehe, hand over all your money and you may leave." <br/>
 <br/>
A familiar sounding voice. <br/>
Why look at that, if it isn't the thief who tried to rob the accessory merchant before. <br/>
What is wrong with this guy? <br/>
He's seriously going to attack a wagon full of straw? <br/>
 <br/>
"Hey! Hurry up and leave all your valuables! Oh? you look pretty famili-" <br/>
 <br/>
The bandit's complexion instantly pales after he takes a look at Raphtalia in disguise. <br/>
 <br/>
"You look different." <br/>
 <br/>
It's probably not necessary to hide any more, so I jump out of the wagon. <br/>
Firo who senses that it's not necessary to disguise herself returns to her Philo Rial · Queen form. <br/>
 <br/>
"Are you fighting?" <br/>
 <br/>
The second princess anxiously asks from the midst of straw. <br/>
 <br/>
"Yeah, probably. Don't worry about it." <br/>
"Why not? Will we be okay?" <br/>
 <br/>
It seems about two thirds of the bandits haven't fought with us before, most of them look at me with a puzzled expression while the rest turn blue. <br/>
 <br/>
"D-D-D-Don't be afraid. Th-This guy has a bounty now. I-If we beat him we can get it." <br/>
 <br/>
He declares while stuttering and trembling. <br/>
That's one hell of a stutter. <br/>
 <br/>
"Even though I ransacked you last month, you're already back on your feet. Quite quick if I do say so myself." <br/>
 <br/>
One of his companions who had a puzzled expression prepares to attack. <br/>
 <br/>
"Sh-Shut up!  Because of you I'm just a lackey in another group of thieves now!" <br/>
"Ah, so you guys merged?" <br/>
"The boss has returned to his country!" <br/>
"That's great. You should also resign from these types of jobs." <br/>
"Sh-Shut up! You're going to get it!" <br/>
 <br/>
They all take up their weapons and charge us. <br/>
 <br/>
"Firo! Raphtalia!" <br/>
"Okay!" <br/>
"Okay~!" <br/>
 <br/>
I step back to protect the second princess. <br/>
Neither Raphtalia nor Firo will lose to thieves of this level. <br/>
 <br/>
"Eat this!" <br/>
 <br/>
One of the thieves swings his sword at Firo. <br/>
 <br/>
"Firo-chan!" <br/>
 <br/>
The second princess pops out of the straw, extends her hands and starts to chant. <br/>
What? The second princess can fight?" <br/>
 <br/>
"I command the origin of power. I have read and deciphered a law of nature. blast them with water!" <br/>
"Ars ・Tzuvait・Aqua Shot!" <br/>
(Tl note: 「アル・ツヴァイト・アクアショット！」 Anyone got a better name let me know.) <br/>
 <br/>
Huh? <br/>
Water erupts from the second princess's hands and speeds towards the thieves. <br/>
Tzuvait. It is an adjective that makes a magic intermediate class. As for Ars, it means multiple magic systems. <br/>
 <br/>
"Uge!" <br/>
"Gawa!" <br/>
"Ugu!" <br/>
 <br/>
The thieves near Firo are blown away. <br/>
That packs quite the punch. <br/>
 <br/>
"I command the origin of power. I have read and deciphered a law of nature. Cut them with blades of water!" <br/>
"Tzuvait・Aqua Slash!" <br/>
 <br/>
The second princess follows up immediately with another spell. <br/>
More water erupts from her hands but this time instead of a ball of water, blades of water released. <br/>
Somehow, I heard something dangerous. <br/>
She missed her target, but the tree that she did hit was cut in half. <br/>
 <br/>
"Next......I'll use......" <br/>
 <br/>
She's gasping for breath. It seems to be difficult casting continuously. <br/>
 <br/>
"They have a magician! She's also an expert!" <br/>
"Firo-chan!" <br/>
"Okay~!" <br/>
 <br/>
The bandits who are staring at the second princess in surprise are kicked like toys by Firo. <br/>
 <br/>
"I'm finished over there." <br/>
"Not yet~!" <br/>
 <br/>
One of the thieves snuck around us by taking advantage of the confusion, and tried to jump the second princess. <br/>
 <br/>
"Air Strike Shield!" <br/>
"Argg!" <br/>
 <br/>
Right as he jumps I summon a shield in between them. <br/>
 <br/>
"Not yet!" <br/>
 <br/>
The remaining thieves start charging at the second princess who is our weakest link. <br/>
 <br/>
"Second shield, Change Shield" <br/>
 <br/>
I call another shield to protect her and then I instantly change shields. <br/>
I'll just use the Bee Needle Shield this time. they may accidentally die from sustained poison damage. I'll just stun them with paralysis. <br/>
 <br/>
"Ugh,arg......" <br/>
 <br/>
One of the thieves is hit by my the second shield and falls down convulsing. <br/>
 <br/>
"Still not done yet!" <br/>
 <br/>
The first thief who approached the second princess begins to crawl. <br/>
 <br/>
"No, it's over." <br/>
"Ah......" <br/>
 <br/>
A big shadow looms over the thief. It seems he noticed too. I hear crying. <br/>
Probably one of thieves crying in resignation. <br/>
 <br/>
"I'll help Mel-chan!" <br/>
 <br/>
And with a thud, Firo just body slams him. <br/>
 <br/>
"You guys know the drill. Tell me where your hideout is." <br/>
 <br/>
I ask after tying up all their members. <br/>
 <br/>
"We'll never talk-" <br/>
"Firo" <br/>
"It's over there!" <br/>
"H-hey!" <br/>
 <br/>
It seems the newbie thieves don't know their position. <br/>
 <br/>
"What's wrong?" <br/>
 <br/>
One of the thieves who encountered us last time desperately pleas. <br/>
 <br/>
"That fat bird will eat us if we don't accept obediently!" <br/>
"Are you joking?" <br/>
"Does that guy look like he jokes?" <br/>
 <br/>
I was surprised as the thief talks. <br/>
 <br/>
"Who is that anyway? He used some strange skills and magic." <br/>
'Don't you understand!? That's the shield!" <br/>
"Eh!?" <br/>
 <br/>
The remaining members of the group of thieves all turn blue. <br/>
 <br/>
"The devil and his man-eating bird!?" <br/>
"That's right! that bird eats everything including the head. I'd rather just get kicked and get away!" <br/>
"Please just spare our lives! We'll give you all our property, even the leader's!" <br/>
 <br/>
It seems another rumour has been added to my notoriety...... <br/>
Raphtalia sighs and face-palms. <br/>
 <br/>
"If you tell a lie-" <br/>
"I know! so please spare our lives!" <br/>
 <br/>
The thieves inform me of their hideout location. Of course, we occupied it with overwhelming combat power. <br/>
 <br/>
That day, we spent the night at the bandit hide- I mean inn. And took everything the thieves accumulated. <br/>
It was mostly just food. But since we have been living like fugitives recently,and only eating demons, a decent meal was appreciated.  <br/>
When we entered the second princess was scared, but after a while she settled down. <br/>
Anything that was valuable was collected, and anything that was too troublesome to take was burnt. <br/>
Well if anything is missed, and the thieves reclaim it, I don't really care. <br/>
I half-smiled at the thieves who were despairing. <br/>
They were then rolled out of the hideout. <br/>
 <br/>
"Hey second princess, it seems you practice magic." <br/>
"Yup. I learnt it for self-defence." <br/>
"How much can you use?" <br/>
 <br/>
If the second princess joins our party we could fight better in the future. <br/>
 <br/>
"What level are you?" <br/>
"Uhmm, I'm level 18...... I can use a few Intermediate class water spells." <br/>
 <br/>
That's unexpectedly low. Well, if we're judging by appearance and age she would be very high levelled. <br/>
But intermediate magic huh? <br/>
 <br/>
"So you are good with water?" <br/>
"Yup" <br/>
 <br/>
Her hair is blue. Are they related? <br/>
 <br/>
"I can use a little earth magic too." <br/>
"Hoh......" <br/>
 <br/>
Her repertoire is unexpectedly wide. <br/>
 <br/>
"Oh right,does your elder sister use wind magic?" <br/>
 <br/>
I would rather not remember her. <br/>
I was hit in the back during that duel with wind magic. <br/>
Damn, I'm getting irritated just thinking about it. Let's stop. <br/>
 <br/>
"Older Sister? she is proud of her fire magic, and uses a little wind." <br/>
 <br/>
Oh, it makes sense due to her hair colour.  <br/>
 <br/>
"Your mother is good with fire and water?" <br/>
"That's right" <br/>
 <br/>
Not that it matters. <br/>
 <br/>
"This is probably for the best. for the time being enter my party." <br/>
"Okay" <br/>
 <br/>
I don't intend to rely on her. <br/>
But this is insurance in the case of an emergency. It would be best if we didn't fight though. <br/>
There is always the risk of death. <br/>
I don't want to go in a direction that would not require us to rely on the second princess. <br/>
 <br/>
"Hey. Why did Hero of the Shield-sama make father so angry?" <br/>
"Now that I think about it I didn't tell you. It all started when your sister framed me-" <br/>
 <br/>
That night, I told the second princess everything that trash and bitch did to me. <br/>
Firo also seemed to be listening to my story for some reason, but she stayed quiet. <br/>
I did not hide anything or lie, I just told her the truth. <br/>
Well my feelings and grudges were mixed in a little, but I'll just think of it as education. <br/>
 <br/>
"Father and Elder sister are cruel! Even though Hero of the Shield-sama said bad things to them I can't complain." <br/>
"Right, right." <br/>
"Mother even said to value the Hero of the Shield-sama as much as possible." <br/>
"What?" <br/>
 <br/>
What did you say? Doesn't the religion of this country designate the shield as the devil? <br/>
Is the queen different? <br/>
 <br/>
"What's wrong?" <br/>
"Nothing, I'm just wondering what your mother thinks of me." <br/>
"Um......I don't know. But she sent a letter to father telling him to treat all the heroes the same." <br/>
 <br/>
I understand the second princess's story a little, it seems the queen was worried this would happen to me. <br/>
Oh well, since it all happened anyway thanks to trash. <br/>
 <br/>
"Master, a lot of things happened before Firo was born." <br/>
"That's right" <br/>
"Eh?" <br/>
 <br/>
The second princess has a dumbfounded look. <br/>
 <br/>
"Uhmm Firo-chan how old are you?" <br/>
"One month and three weeks old." <br/>
"Ehh!?" <br/>
 <br/>
Being surprised is correct. Her growth was rapid even for a demon. <br/>
 <br/>
"Firo-can is so precocious" <br/>
"Ehehehe......I was praised." <br/>
"You were praised?" <br/>
"Then I'm the older sister." <br/>
"Well, in the age category. Raphtalia over there is about the same as you." <br/>
"Raphtalia onee-chan is......" <br/>
 <br/>
Firo looks at Raphtalia with an extremely disappointed expression. <br/>
Raphtalia looks at me coldly. <br/>
Well, I understand your feelings since the bird said something like that. <br/>
 <br/>
"Wh-what?" <br/>
"Demi-humans...... even if we are the same age she feels older." <br/>
"Well...... I was not allowed to lose." <br/>
 <br/>
The atmosphere is delicate. <br/>
 <br/>
"Well, despite Raphtalia's age, her appearance suits her." <br/>
 <br/>
That would have immediately labelled me as a lolicon. <br/>
Also, both the second princess and Firo are children. <br/>
Not to mention, Raphtalia became my slave when she was a little girl. <br/>
 <br/>
"This is just how things work out." <br/>
"Naofumi-sama......" <br/>
 <br/>
These three would be considered a Loli-Harem. <br/>
I wonder what the other heroes would say. <br/>
 <br/>
"Anyway, we'll rest here today and cross the border tomorrow." <br/>
""Yay~!"" <br/>
"Okay!"
