<br/>
The Minotaur is around 5 meters tall. <br/>
It is as big as the Big Ogre of before, huh.<br/>
The battle axe that it is holding in its hands is dyed in blood.<br/>
I wonder if the one who screamed managed to run away…<br/>
"Ma-Makoto, w-will it be okay?" (Lucy)<br/>
Lucy is already scared.<br/>
"Since I have the chance here, let’s test out the Spirit Magic that has gotten stronger." (Makoto)<br/>
I take a stance with my dagger and look around.<br/>
With the RPG Player perspective, I could see that there were a countless amount of blue lights around.<br/>
Yup, there’s a whole lot.<br/>
"Hello there, Spirit-sans", I call them.<br/>
It hasn’t been long since I have met the Spirits of Laberintos.<br/>
I gotta give my greetings in an energetic manner.<br/>
"Want to play for a bit?" (Makoto)<br/>
I could feel the attention of the Spirits gathering onto me.<br/>
Looks like the Spirits of Laberintos are pretty cooperative.<br/>
"H-Hey! The Minotaur is already pretty close, you know?! [Stone Bullet]!" (Lucy)<br/>
Lucy released her magic while letting out an agitated voice.<br/>
The rock that was shot approached the Minotaur at high speed and hit him, the rock crumbling into pieces.<br/>
But…it doesn’t seem like it was too effective.<br/>
"N-No way." (Lucy)<br/>
Lucy mutters, but it was a rock that was far smaller than the usual one she makes when doing Meteor Fall.<br/>
She lowered the output way too much.<br/>
"Gwooooooooooo!" <br/>
The Minotaur howls in anger, and with battle axe overhead, it rushes towards us.<br/>
We might get our heads opened by the battle axe in a few seconds.<br/>
"Hey, Makoto!" (Lucy)<br/>
Lucy was in tears.<br/>
It should be about time.<br/>
"[Water Magic: Grand Water Chamber]." (Makoto)<br/>
"Gwo?" <br/>
Water begins to gush out with my feet at the center of it.<br/>
The whole corridor was filled with water in an instant, only covering this corridor alone without gushing outside of it. The Minotaur, Lucy, and I were now underwater.<br/>
"Hnnn! Hnnnn!!" (Lucy) <br/>
Ah, crap.<br/>
Lucy can’t use [Underwater Breathing].<br/>
I hurriedly held her hand.<br/>
With this, the effect of the magic should be shared onto her.<br/>
"Guo! Glub! Gag!" <br/>
The Minotaur was struggling to escape from the water-filled chamber.<br/>
Well, that’s gonna be impossible though.<br/>
[Water Magic: Water Current].<br/>
"Hoi hoi." (Makoto)<br/>
I spin my finger.<br/>
I create a whirlwind like a washing machine, and the Minotaur is made to spin inside it.<br/>
The giant monster had its eyes spin, and just like that, it turned silent.<br/>
I get rid of the water called, and give my thanks to the Spirits.<br/>
"Haah…Haaah…" (Lucy)<br/>
Lucy was out of breath.<br/>
Even if we used Underwater Breathing magic, I must have surprised her by suddenly throwing her into water, huh.<br/>
"I-I’m sorry. Are you okay?" (Makoto)<br/>
"I’m okay… Hey, that was amazing! That was High Grade magic, right?" (Lucy)<br/>
"Yeah, it went well." (Makoto)<br/>
"What’s going on?! You can use High Magic now?" (Lucy)<br/>
"No, I had the Spirits help me out. The Spirits apparently have infinite mana, so it seems like that level of magic is a piece of cake for them. It is problematic that they can’t deal with fine control though." (Makoto)<br/>
Thanks to that, Lucy and I were caught up in it.<br/>
"By the way, what should we do about this guy?" (Makoto)<br/>
I look down at the Minotaur we defeated. <br/>
It is a big one we managed to defeat after all.<br/>
"We can’t carry it, huh." (Lucy)<br/>
"It is at times like this when I would like storage magic." (Makoto)<br/>
Fuji-yan not being here is regretful.<br/>
"Oi, you guys. You defeated the Minotaur?!" <br/>
"Y-You saved us…" <br/>
"Thank you, thank you!" <br/>
Adventurers who were in tatters came out.<br/>
The people who were screaming before maybe?<br/>
According to what they said, in the time they were running away from it, the Minotaur saw Lucy and changed targets to her.<br/>
Did it react to her red hair?<br/>
"Lucy, you are really loved by monsters." (Makoto)<br/>
"That doesn’t make me happy at all…" (Lucy)<br/>
"Hey, if you are troubled with carrying this monster, we will help you." <br/>
Ooh! That would really help us out.<br/>
While we did that, they taught us a variety of things about Laberintos on our way back.<br/>
"So, it has been half a year since you guys came to Laberintos?" (Makoto)<br/>
"Yeah, we became fresh Iron Ranks, so we were slowly training in the Upper Floor." <br/>
"But the monsters have been growing active lately." (Makoto)<br/>
"Yeah, the situation is a bit strange." <br/>
"Rumors say that a Taboo Dragon has appeared in the Lower Floor." <br/>
"Taboo Dragon?" (Makoto)<br/>
"An abominable dragon. A type of evil dragon that served the Great Demon Lord 1,000 years ago. It releases miasma from its body, and spits out curses from its mouth. I heard that they suck your life if you get close to it. Did it really appear?" (Lucy)<br/>
Lucy explained to me.<br/>
"It has nothing to do with intermediate adventurers like us, so we don’t know in detail." <br/>
"But you guys are impressive. Easily defeating a Minotaur with just the two of you." <br/>
"Silver Rank? Could it be that you are Gold, at that young of an age?" <br/>
"No no, we are also Iron Rank." (Makoto)<br/>
"Hoh! Then, your futures are bright!" <br/>
We had an energetic conversation as we returned to the exit. <br/>
There, we told the guild staff member that we have returned, and passed them the monster.<br/>
The assessment result of the defeated monster will be told to us later at the guild it seems.<br/>
More importantly, there’s something that bothered me.<br/>
"It is kind of noisy." (Makoto)<br/>
"Did something happen?" (Lucy)<br/>
"Aah, it seems like the Highland Army from the Sun Country has come."<br/>
The person of the guild told me.<br/>
"I see. If it is the Sun Country, that must mean the Sun Knight Order, the Sunshine Knights?" (Makoto)<br/>
"Maybe it really is to subjugate the Taboo Dragon?" (Lucy)<br/>
"But what’s with the army getting involved in a city of adventurers?" <br/>
"Moreover, from a different country." <br/>
Looks like the adventurers who came with us were also interested. <br/>
"Let’s go check it out." (Makoto)<br/>
"Let’s go!" (Lucy)<br/>
We head back to the gates of the city.<br/>
◇◇<br/>
 "So this is the Sun Knight Order, huh…" (Makoto)<br/>
The forest around the area of the city’s gate had been lumbered, and had become the camp of the army. <br/>
There were many tents there.<br/>
Around the area there were horses and wyverns slightly further away and tied up.<br/>
It is called a Knight Order, but there’s knights, warriors, archers, mages, priests, and many other jobs, making it a giant party of sorts. <br/>
At their chest there’s a crest of a big sun with a phoenix shining.<br/>
They all look strong.<br/>
The people of the adventurer city seem to be interested in it as well, the onlookers are increasing more and more.<br/>
"Kyaaa! Look, it is the Light Hero-sama!"<br/>
"Aah, so gallant…"<br/>
The female adventurers raise cheers.<br/>
"Wow! That’s the Light Hero! This is the first time I see him!" (Lucy)<br/>
Lucy seems to be merry too. <br/>
I don’t really know how to feel here.<br/>
The person there is my classmate here that I separated from 1 year and a half ago, Sakurai-kun.<br/>
At his side there’s a classmate of mine too, Yokoyama-san.<br/>
Hm? Wasn’t there one other?<br/>
They are wearing equipment several times better-looking and expensive-looking than that of the people around.<br/>
It is not like I am jealous, okay?<br/>
Don’t tell me this is the good meeting you were talking about, Goddess-sama.<br/>
