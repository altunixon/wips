<br/>
"Makoto, we are beginning today’s meeting." <br/>
By the time I noticed, Noah-sama was there.<br/>
I was training till 2 a.m. but it seems like I fell asleep at some point in time. <br/>
Noah-sama is for some reason not in the usual one piece.<br/>
She has a tight black skirt, and a white business shirt.<br/>
By the way, she has glasses on.<br/>
A female teacher style?<br/>
"It is good to see you in good health, Noah-sama. What is with that outfit?" (Makoto)<br/>
"We are aiming to overturn the world together! Don’t I look like a reliable woman?" (Noah)<br/>
She pushes her glasses up as she says so.<br/>
When I look at her…<br/>
(I can only see it as cosplay…) (Makoto)<br/>
"How rude. Well, fine. You remember our objective, right?" (Noah)<br/>
"Eliminate the threat that is the Great Demon Lord. At the same time, lower the faith of the Holy Gods’ believers, right?" (Makoto)<br/>
The Goddess writes on the whiteboard that is floating midair.<br/>
Then, ‘Bam!’ she slams the whiteboard.<br/>
"Now! What will we do from now on, Makoto?" (Noah)<br/>
The Goddess is really into this.<br/>
"Find strong comrades?" (Makoto)<br/>
I don’t think I can overturn the world’s system by myself.<br/>
"Nice answer. Then, who will you be making your ally specifically?" (Noah)<br/>
"Hmm, Sakurai-kun, maybe? The heroes?" (Makoto)<br/>
But they are strongly influenced by the Holy Gods, so it is most likely impossible to make them our allies.<br/>
"It doesn’t sound bad. But even though the hero bunch is strong in terms of power, in terms of affecting the world, they have their limits." (Noah)<br/>
"Converting their religion to yours slowly would be impossible though?" (Makoto)<br/>
"That’s right! That’s why, our aim is these people!" (Noah)<br/>
What Noah-sama wrote on the whiteboard was…<br/>
"…Oracles? Eh?" (Makoto)<br/>
"There’s two Oracles that you are acquainted with, Makoto." (Noah)<br/>
Princess Noel and Princess Sofia are written there.<br/>
"No no no, that’s definitely impossible." (Makoto)<br/>
Princess Noel is engaged to Sakurai-kun, and Princess Sofia hates me.<br/>
Or more like, I am not good at dealing with her.<br/>
"It is okay! The opposite of like is disinterest. You can change hate to like!" (Noah)<br/>
"It is not going to go as smoothly as a galge game." (Makoto)<br/>
In the galge games that Fuji-yan likes, the heroins that hated the protagonist at first would fall in love completely in the middle. <br/>
But that’s in games.<br/>
In my experience, once you get hated by a girl, you stay hated.<br/>
"Then, how about stealing away Noel-chan?" (Noah)<br/>
"Spare me from that." (Makoto)<br/>
From all people, the girlfriend of Sakurai-kun?<br/>
There’s no way I can do that.<br/>
"In the first place, if I were to try something with the Oracles, wouldn’t the Holy Gods retaliate?" (Makoto)<br/>
"Right. However, the Oracles of the Goddesses in your continent have massive influential power. Think about how your relationship will be with them. At the very least, that attitude from before is NG." (Noah)<br/>
"…Understood." (Makoto)<br/>
I nod with doubts.<br/>
It is true that having the princess of the place you are living in hate you isn’t good.<br/>
"Can I say something too?" (Makoto)<br/>
"Fumu, go ahead and say it, Makoto." (Noah)<br/>
You don’t have to push up your glasses each and every single time.<br/>
"I am thinking about telling Fuji-yan and my party about your objective and have them help out." (Makoto)<br/>
"Hmm, but they might not cooperate." (Noah)<br/>
"When that happens, I will give up. I won’t force them." (Makoto)<br/>
"They might tattle on you to the Church, you know?" (Noah)<br/>
"They wouldn’t do that." (Makoto)<br/>
I responded slightly irritated.<br/>
"It was a joke. But be careful when choosing who to tell." (Noah)<br/>
Being exposed to being an Evil God believer would be bad after all.<br/>
"Got it. I will be careful and search for people I can trust." (Makoto)<br/>
"Right. First, from people close to you. I think that’s a good idea." (Noah)<br/>
I have obtained the agreement of Noah-sama.<br/>
Then, I will talk with Fuji-yan, Lucy, and Sa-san.<br/>
"By the way, Noah-sama, when would it be okay to challenge the Deep Sea Temple?" (Makoto)<br/>
Saving the Goddess that is trapped in the Deep Sea Temple.<br/>
That’s one of my objectives.<br/>
It is not like I have forgotten.<br/>
But the Goddess scratched her head as if troubled.<br/>
"The Deep Sea Temple is being protected by the Leviathan of King Neptune." (Noah)<br/>
"I have heard about it." (Makoto)<br/>
In mythology.<br/>
"The divine beast, Leviathan…is stronger than the Great Demon Lord if you were to fight it inside the ocean." (Noah)<br/>
"…Eh?" (Makoto)<br/>
"We are talking here about a king of the demons that only ruled the surface world 1,000 years ago to a monster that has been the ruler of the sea for several tens of thousands of years. There’s no need to compare." (Noah)<br/>
Even if you tell me that, the information written in the Adventurer Guild didn’t have that.<br/>
Stronger than the last boss? Isn’t that a hidden boss?<br/>
"I will first do something about the Great Demon Lord." (Makoto)<br/>
"Wise choice." (Noah)<br/>
Noah-sama nods several times with arms crossed.<br/>
"Then, that’s it for today." (Makoto)<br/>
"Bye bye." (Noah)<br/>
Noah-sama saw me off with her waving hand.<br/>
She seems to be having fun.<br/>
◇◇<br/>
 We are at the tatami room deep in the Cat Ears Garden.<br/>
I explained about the matter of Noah-sama to Fuji-yan.<br/>
It would be the end if he were to refuse here…<br/>
"Haah…" (Fujiwara)<br/>
Fuji-yan lets out a big sigh.<br/>
"You have chosen a problematic path…" (Fujiwara)<br/>
"Y-Yeah." (Makoto)<br/>
"When playing games with several difficulties, you were the kind of guy that would always go for the hardest one." (Fujiwara)<br/>
"Easy and Normal are hand-holding." (Makoto)<br/>
"There’s no need to have the same policy in this world though…" (Fujiwara)<br/>
Yeah, I do think the same.<br/>
But I chose it.<br/>
"I will help out to a reasonable extent." (Fujiwara)<br/>
"Thank you!" (Makoto)<br/>
I’m so glad! This is a real saving.<br/>
I fell over to the back of my seat with a sigh of relief.<br/>
I was so nervous.<br/>
Fuji-yan stifles a laugh.<br/>
"We are partners here, Takki-dono." (Fujiwara)<br/>
"But there’s limits, you know." (Makoto)<br/>
This time around, I asked for quite the crazy thing after all.<br/>
After that, we had some casual talk, and I suddenly remembered a certain promise.<br/>
"Changing the subject." (Makoto)<br/>
Nina-san had asked me of this.<br/>
"About Nina-san…" (Makoto)<br/>
At that moment, I noticed the grimace of Fuji-yan.<br/>
Eh? Was it bad?<br/>
"No… It isn’t something I would hide from you, Takki-dono." (Fujiwara)<br/>
Fuji-yan speaks as if having trouble in saying it.<br/>
To my surprise, it seems like Christiana-san has asked him to marry her!<br/>
"Wow. Then, you are going to become a noble now, Fuji-yan." (Makoto)<br/>
Ah, but Nina-san…<br/>
"I haven’t told Nina-dono yet… Or more like, I don’t know if I should accept." (Fujiwara)<br/>
"So you are troubled." (Makoto)<br/>
"Chris-sama and Nina-dono don’t get along after all." (Fujiwara)<br/>
"Well, they are rivals in love." (Makoto)<br/>
"That’s not all-desu zo." (Fujiwara)<br/>
The nobles of this continent apparently look down on the demi-humans like beastkins and elves.<br/>
The Sun Country seems to have the strongest inclination towards that.<br/>
The nobles are like that, not only in the Water Country.<br/>
Also, the noble that was the master of Nina-san had a bad personality, and that made Nina-san hate nobles.<br/>
"No wonder they can’t get along… But you like Nina-san, right?" (Makoto)<br/>
"Of course. She is the first person that I hired when I first began business in this world. She has been doing her best until now and has helped out in my store." (Fujiwara)<br/>
"Her bunny ears are cute." (Makoto)<br/>
"…Yeah." (Fujiwara)<br/>
You don’t have to get embarrassed by that at this point.<br/>
"What do you think of Chris-san?" (Makoto)<br/>
Why am I questioning him this much? <br/>
But talking with Fuji-yan about this would be unthinkable in our previous world. It is a bit fun.<br/>
We had zero relations with women after all.<br/>
"Chris-dono…the first time I met her, she was troubled by her future and about marrying. She consulted with me about those things." (Fujiwara)<br/>
It seems like she had doubts about being bethrothered to the person that her parents prepared as a noble.<br/>
And Fuji-yan brought that out with his talking skills.<br/>
At that time, he wanted to get closer to the nobles in order to succeed as a merchant.<br/>
We otherworldlers have no relatives or connections here, so it couldn’t be helped.<br/>
"So, by the time you noticed, she had fallen in love with you, huh." (Makoto)<br/>
"She even went as far as rejecting her arranged marriage for me…" (Fujiwara)<br/>
"O-Ooh…that’s quite the responsibility there…" (Makoto)<br/>
Yeah, it already feels like a completely different world.<br/>
"Well, this is my problem. I will do something about it-desu zo." (Fujiwara)<br/>
Fuji-yan gulps down his ale.<br/>
H-Hmm, so mature.<br/>
He looks my way as if changing the topic.<br/>
"Can I request one thing of you?" (Fujiwara)<br/>
"O-Of course." (Makoto)<br/>
I am having him accompany me who’s an Evil God believer.<br/>
I plan on helping him in about as much as possible, but will I be able to help him?<br/>
"I got a free business permission in Rozes the other day, right? I was thinking about doing a new business, but I am looking for good ideas." (Fujiwara)<br/>
"Hooh, I see." (Makoto)<br/>
But asking such an important thing to a newbie.<br/>
"These kind of things are better to ask a variety of people." (Fujiwara)<br/>
"Hmm, wouldn’t it have to be something related to the beast ears that you love?" (Makoto)<br/>
"I have done all of that already-desu zo. I am already the owner of this establishment now after all." (Fujiwara)<br/>
"Eh?" (Makoto)<br/>
W-What?! The owner of the Cat Ears Garden is Fuji-yan?<br/>
…At an unknown time, my friend had bought the store that we always go to.<br/>
"T-Then, how about opening a ramen store since you like them so much, Fuji-yan." (Makoto)<br/>
"I have made a contract with a pig farm for ramen use. I think we are about to get the ideal taste." (Fujiwara)<br/>
"…Wow." (Makoto)<br/>
No good. He has long since begun what I would think.<br/>
I should switch my view and begin searching for my specialty that is water magic.<br/>
"Then, what about this?" (Makoto)<br/>
"…Fumu, fumu, fumu, fumu…what?! Is something like that possible?! We can use that!" (Fujiwara)<br/>
Looks like it was a viable idea.<br/>
