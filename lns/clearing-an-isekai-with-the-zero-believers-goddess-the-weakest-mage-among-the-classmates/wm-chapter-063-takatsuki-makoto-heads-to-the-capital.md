TLN: Sponsored Chapter!!<br/>
This one is a short chapter, so I am releasing one more chapter. Because it wouldn’t be fair that a sponsored chapter ends up being shorter than your regular one!<br/>
Enjoy!<br/>
<br/>
The objective is the capital of Rozes, Horun.<br/>
In this journey too, we are travelling in Fuji-yan’s Flying Ship.<br/>
It is because Fuji-yan plans on receiving the business permit from Princess Sofia.<br/>
I thought the trip would be lighthearted like the previous time though…<br/>
"Everyone, I will be accompanying you all in this time’s journey. Please take care of me." <br/>
The one smiling elegantly is the daughter of Makkaren’s feudal lord, Lady Christiana.<br/>
Is the one behind her her personal maid? <br/>
Also, there’s a female warrior that’s most likely her bodyguard.<br/>
(Fuji-yan, why is Christiana-san here?) (Makoto)<br/>
(She said she was coming no matter what and didn’t listen-desu zo) (Fujiwara)<br/>
We were talking in whispers.<br/>
"Christana-sama, don’t you have work to do?" (Nina)<br/>
Nina-san deals with her with a frown.<br/>
"Yes, I have left it to my subordinates. Greeting royalty is also the job of land nobles." (Chris)<br/>
Christiana-san didn’t break her expression.<br/>
"I feel pity for the subordinate that got the job pushed on them." (Nina)<br/>
"There’s no problem. By the way, where’s my room?" (Chris)<br/>
"Who knows. There might not be an open room." (Nina)<br/>
"Oh my. Then, I don’t mind sharing the room with Fujiwara-sama." (Chris)<br/>
""……""<br/>
I feel an ominous air. <br/>
I glance at my side.<br/>
Fuji-yan was also looking at me.<br/>
(Sorry, I can’t help you out here.) (Makoto)<br/>
I whisper to him in my mind.<br/>
I felt sorry for my good friend that had a truly sad expression.<br/>
◇◇<br/>
 After dinner, on top of the Flying Ship at night. <br/>
I continue training my water magic below the light of the moon.<br/>
It would have been nice to have a drink with Fuji-yan under the moonlight like last time, but it seems like Fuji-yan has been caught by Christiana-san or Nina-san.<br/>
Or maybe both.<br/>
"Popular men have it rough." (Makoto)<br/>
I make the birds I created flap around while enjoying the night wind.<br/>
Hmm, the closer I get to the capital, the less energetic the Spirits are.<br/>
(Makoto, the control of the Holy Gods is stronger in their capital, so the Spirits get proportionally weaker.) (Noah)<br/>
Is that so, Noah-sama…<br/>
I am a bit uneasy.<br/>
I don’t think a monster will appear at the capital though.<br/>
It won’t, right?<br/>
"Takatsuki-kun?" <br/>
While I spaced-out looking at the moon and training, Sa-san came over.<br/>
"That dinner just now…was awkward, wasn’t it…?" (Aya)<br/>
"Aah, yeah…" (Makoto)<br/>
Christiana-san was pushing Fuji-yan’s answer about the marriage in the middle of the dinner.<br/>
Nina-san snapped at that.<br/>
The atmosphere turned terrible in an instant.<br/>
They didn’t hide how they hate each other, and the thorny conversations went on.<br/>
"Fujiwara-san should just tell her clearly that Nina-san is his girlfriend!" (Aya)<br/>
Sa-san seems to be the ally of Nina-san.<br/>
She has been learning martial arts from Nina-san lately, so there’s no surprise there.<br/>
But…<br/>
"Christiana-san seems to have broken up with her previous fiance for Fuji-yan, you know." (Makoto)<br/>
"Hooh…Fujiwara-kun is popular." (Aya)<br/>
Sa-san says with an expression as if unexpected.<br/>
Well, we were not popular at all in our high school time after all.<br/>
"But that doesn’t matter though. It is not like you have to go out with her because she broke up with her fiance." (Aya)<br/>
"Y-Yeah." (Makoto)<br/>
That’s true, but…<br/>
In Fuji-yan’s case, he has the cheat skill of Galge Player.<br/>
Christiana-san falling in love with Fuji-yan after accurately understanding her worries and giving her advice might have been inevitable.<br/>
The nobility conflicts about succession sound like they would be tiring after all.<br/>
I am seeing the scariness of the Galge Player Skill.<br/>
I am glad my Skills are peaceful in that area.<br/>
Because it is only changing perspectives and choices showing up!<br/>
I would have liked them to be a bit stronger though!<br/>
While I was making a complicated expression, Sa-san seems to have thought of something.<br/>
"Hey, Takatsuki-kun, could it be that you are bothered by the fact that Fujiwara-kun is popular, and yet, you don’t have a girlfriend?" (Aya)<br/>
Eh? Did I have that kind of face?<br/>
"No no no, I am not bothered by that at all." (Makoto)<br/>
I seriously am not.<br/>
I am stalwart.<br/>
"Really~?" (Aya)<br/>
Sa-san wraps her arms around mine with a grin.<br/>
Is that a habit of Lamias?<br/>
Her entangling has gotten more aggressive than her previous self.<br/>
"Hey, what are you doing?" <br/>
Lucy with a slightly stiff voice appears.<br/>
We made too much noise huh.<br/>
"Takatsuki-kun said he wanted a girlfriend." (Aya)<br/>
"Eh?!", Lucy shouts in surprise.<br/>
"Sa-san, I didn’t say that." (Makoto)<br/>
"H-Hmm, geez, Makoto. So that’s how it was." (Lucy)<br/>
Lucy shifted her way to the opposite side from Sa-san.<br/>
Uhm…hey, are you listening to what I’m saying?<br/>
"Sa-san, Lucy, I am in the middle of my magic training." (Makoto)<br/>
"You are saying that in this situation?" (Aya)<br/>
"You have flowers in both arms." (Lucy)<br/>
Sa-san’s cool temperature, and Lucy’s high temperature. <br/>
Aah, if not for Clear Mind, I would have tapped out a long time ago.<br/>
It is dead in the night.<br/>
Sandwiched by two cute girls.<br/>
Yeah, this is quite the lucky situation for a man. <br/>
Right.<br/>
I had an important thing to tell these two.<br/>
It would be better to tell them before arriving to the capital.<br/>
It is by no means me trying to change the topic.<br/>
"Lucy, Sa-san, I have something important to tell you." (Makoto)<br/>
"What?" (Lucy)<br/>
"What’s the matter?" (Aya)<br/>
"About the Goddess…" (Makoto)<br/>
I tell Lucy and Sa-san about Noah-sama.<br/>
That I will be fighting the world as an Evil God Apostle.<br/>
The two listened to me with serious expressions.<br/>
"I won’t force you to cooperate with me. But there’s the possibility that it will be dangerous if you continue to stay with me—" (Makoto)<br/>
"How stupid, Makoto." (Lucy)<br/>
Lucy cuts off my words as if this was silly.<br/>
"We are a party, aren’t we?" (Lucy)<br/>
Lucy says with hands on her waist and exhaling through her nose.<br/>
"That’s what you were worrying about lately, huh. You should have told me already." (Lucy)<br/>
"Lucy…" (Makoto)<br/>
I wonder why, a different feeling is welling up compared to the time when Fuji-yan told me he would help me out.<br/>
"There’s no need to confirm with us every single time. We are your allies, Takatsuki-kun." (Aya)<br/>
Sa-san, who is shorter than me, pets my head.<br/>
"Sa-san…" (Makoto)<br/>
Sometimes, she would treat me like I am younger than her, or more like, a little brother.<br/>
Since way before.<br/>
And it doesn’t feel bad.<br/>
"Thank you… It really takes off from my shoulders." (Makoto)<br/>
In this way, there’s now 3 allies for the Evil God Apostle.<br/>
(Oh my, you are one playboy, Makoto.) (Noah)<br/>
Please don’t tease me, Noah-sama.<br/>
"By the way, we were the first ones you told about being the enemies of the world, right?" (Lucy)<br/>
"No, I have already told Fuji-yan." (Makoto)<br/>
""Eh?""<br/>
Was there a need to get surprised in stereo?<br/>
"Aren’t these kinds of things first brought up to your party members?" (Lucy)<br/>
"Why is it that I, who has been acquainted with you since middle school, was told later?" (Aya)<br/>
The two were displeased.<br/>
No, you know, Fuji-yan has a mind reading skill, so I had to tell him first.<br/>
The fact that I can’t tell them that is vexing.<br/>
"Emily told me that Makoto might like men more than women. You don’t show interest in my attire after all." (Lucy)<br/>
Oi, that’s slandering.<br/>
I will sue you.<br/>
"…Now that you mention it, at high school, he would always be talking only to Fujiwara-kun at lunch break." (Aya)<br/>
We were talking about the new games coming out!<br/>
I intended this to be a serious talk, but the two of them are the same as always.<br/>
Next time when I have an important talk, I should tell these two immediately without worrying about it.<br/>
That’s how I felt after this.<br/>
