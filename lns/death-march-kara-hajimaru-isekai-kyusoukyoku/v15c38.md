15-38. Divine Punishment (7), Hero Vs Demon Lord<br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
※ This is not from Satou's viewpoint<br/>
<br/>
"Here comes one, demon lord."<br/>
<br/>
Hero Meiko looks over below.<br/>
<br/>
『kiLL degozaru』<br/>
<br/>
A fox demon lord with swords as its arms makes an imposing pose while spreading its sickle-like arms.<br/>
<TLN: Typo'd as weasel in the previous chapter. Fox is the correct one.> <br/>
<br/>
--ＫＩＬＬＫＩＬＬＫＩＬＬ！<br/>
<br/>
With the demon lord's roar, its chest split apart and a bright red ball of light is shot toward Hero Meiko.<br/>
<br/>
"Shoot out 100 times that if you want to hit me!"<br/>
<br/>
Hero Meiko easily evaded it but the light ball suddenly turned around and pursued her sky orbit.<br/>
The fallen light ball hit the ground and created a white crater with a huge sound.<br/>
<br/>
"Fuhn, that's some power. But--"<br/>
<br/>
The hero's sword cuts the demon lord's sword arm.<br/>
<br/>
"There's no point if it doesn't hit."<br/>
<br/>
Hero Meiko smirks, it seems she's satisfied to be able to say a line from a famous anime.<br/>
<br/>
--ＫＩＬＲＫＩＬＬＫＩＲＬ！<br/>
<br/>
Hero Meiko wounds the rampaging demon lord one sidedly.<br/>
<br/>
"Your demon lordness is just all show isn't it. You're totally weak."<br/>
<br/>
――ＫＩＲＬＫＩＬＲＫＩＲＲ！<br/>
<br/>
The demon lord's body is wrapped in purple light.<br/>
<br/>
"Unique Skill now of all time? You should've used it from the start, this isn't a game you know."<br/>
<br/>
The demon lord attacked without reacting to the hero.<br/>
While leaving game-like blur effect--afterimage body doubles.<br/>
<br/>
"Geh, gross."<br/>
<br/>
Hero Meiko, with her limited vocabulary, backed away, and then she held her holy sword upward to counter it.<br/>
<br/>
It's as if she's saying that this is the way to hold Holy Sword Excalibur.<br/>
The purple haired little girl house-sitting in the solitary island palace would have agreed with her if she were here.<br/>
<br/>
--Dazzling holy light surrounds the hero once again.<br/>
<br/>
Far stronger light than when she used her Unique Skill up until now.<br/>
There's a jewel like blue crest of light on the surface of her skin if you look closely.<br/>
<br/>
"It'll be the same no matter how many times you try!"<br/>
<br/>
Just like before, she randomly evades the attack and counters by swinging her holy sword down.<br/>
<br/>
Yet--.<br/>
<br/>
"Guha"<br/>
<br/>
Hero Meiko rolled on the ground while screaming unbecoming of a girl.<br/>
<br/>
"Ouch, what're you doing to a girl."<br/>
<br/>
Blood is dripping from the huge wound on the back of Hero Meiko who's standing up unsteadily.<br/>
<br/>
"This time, it's my--"<br/>
<br/>
She's cut on the back once again, Hero Meiko fell on the ground while raising smoke of white salt.<br/>
Hero Meiko was literally applying salt on her wound in agony.<br/>
<br/>
The holy light that envelopes her is flickering like a broken electric spark.<br/>
<br/>
『seEmsYoucan'tEVadeATTacksoutsIDeofcognizanceDEEgozaruNA』<br/>
<br/>
Sword arm demon lord laughed loudly, saying 'it seems you can't evade attacks outside of cognizance'.<br/>
<br/>
"You spoiled it! I won't fall for the same trap."<br/>
<br/>
Hero Meiko stood up while taking an acceleration magic potion.<br/>
<br/>
Hero Meiko suddenly got close to the demon lord with Flickering Movement and unleashed a slashing attack.<br/>
However, it seemed she assessed something, she pulled back her sword and rolled to the side.<br/>
<br/>
『ForeSIGht DEgozarukA?　ormaYYYYYYBe just good intuitionDEgozarukA』<br/>
<br/>
It seems Hero Meiko had anticipated the reverberation of the space magic the sword arm demon lord was going to use.<br/>
It's the same technique the red-body demon skillfully used against Hero Nanashi once.<br/>
<br/>
『evading WIthout AttacKINg YourE CORNERed DAAEgozaru』<br/>
<br/>
The hero who evaded the demon lord's sword arm was kicked by a fox leg clad in purple light from her blind spot.<br/>
Hero Meiko spat out saliva mixed with salt, standing up unsteadily.<br/>
<br/>
"I have to create some distance--If I can't defeat you at close distance, I'll do it from afar."<br/>
<br/>
Hero Meiko retreated back using Flickering movement and took out countless magic cannons from her [Infinite Arsenal (Inexhaustible Swords)].<br/>
sure of her victory the hero grinned, then suddenly her view was blurred and the demon lord appeared right in front of her.<br/>
<br/>
"Wha--"<br/>
<br/>
The demon lord speaks to Hero Meiko who couldn't react to the abrupt development.<br/>
<br/>
『pULLed, DAAEgozaru.』<br/>
"Ahahaha, this, can't be real right?"<br/>
<br/>
Her hand that was going to grasp the magic cannons grasps upon empty air.<br/>
No wonder, as the magic cannons that have been taken out are left behind far away.<br/>
<br/>
"Geha."<br/>
<br/>
Receiving an overhead blow from behind, Hero Meiko's upper body was buried in the white salt ground.<br/>
Her legs above ground aren't moving at all.<br/>
<br/>
The holy light enveloping Hero Meiko finally loses its light and disappears.<br/>
<br/>
『theEND, ＤＡＡＡＡＺＥgozaru』<br/>
<br/>
The demon lord swings its sword arm.<br/>
<br/>
"....■■■■■■ Explosion!"<br/>
<br/>
Clear sounds resounded in the battlefield, an explosion wrapped up the demon lord.<br/>
It's a special spell of the previous hero's follower, Ringrande.<br/>
<br/>
"Even like that, she's still a Saga Empire's hero. I can't let you easily kill her."<br/>
<br/>
Her armor is broken, half of her beautiful silver hair is dirtied by red blood.<br/>
No one knows how she could escape the nuclear explosion, but she's by no mean only slightly wounded.<br/>
<br/>
"ＤＡＡＡＡＺＥdegozaru"<br/>
<br/>
The sword arm demon lord clad in dark purple light showed up, cutting the explosion apart.<br/>
<br/>
The sword demon lord has already lost its ability to speak recognizably.<br/>
<br/>
Ringrande continously shot [Quick Burst] that could be chanted quickly at the attacking Sword Demon Lord, but none of it hit the demon lord.<br/>
<br/>
--ＤＡＡＥＧＷＯＯＯＺＡＡＡＡＬＷ.<br/>
<br/>
She could barely protect Hero Meiko from one of its attack, let alone counterattacking.<br/>
She changed to space magic midway and rolled under the smoke from the explosion she created herself while carrying Hero Meiko toward the imperial capital.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
◇<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
"Aryarya? Where is this nanodesu?"<br/>
<br/>
Suddenly appearing in the sky of the Weasel Empire's capital.<br/>
A master and her servant came from a gate that no one noticed.<br/>
<br/>
Golden Knight Yellow and her Beast Steed, lesser dragon Lyuryu.<br/>
<br/>
"Somehow, it doesn't seem like Seryuu City nanodesuyo?"<br/>
<br/>
Golden Knight Yellow tilted her head in puzzlement.<br/>
She never thought that she would be led to a different place by the little girl.<br/>
<br/>
--ＬＹＵＲＹＵＲＹＵＵＵ.<br/>
<br/>
"Somehow, there's a lot of enemies nodesu."<br/>
<br/>
The white dragon inclined its wing toward the enemies.<br/>
<br/>
"Lyuryu there's a big meat over there nodesu! So many wonderful sukiyaki and hamburg steak, Pochi doesn't know what to do nodesu."<br/>
<br/>
Even when she saw the huge Great Weasel Demon Lord, the Golden Knight Yellow naught uttered fear nor awe, but appetite.<br/>
Is she a big-shot or is she just a glutton, no one can judge for sure.<br/>
<br/>
『--Connection Lost. GPS Signal Lost.』<br/>
"Armor person is saying some difficult things nodesu."<br/>
<br/>
The Raka Clone installed in the golden armor reported the lost of the connection to the Solitary Island Palace.<br/>
<br/>
"Aryarya? It doesn't connect to Master nodesuyo?"<br/>
<br/>
Since she didn't understand the situation, Golden Knight Yellow tried to contact her Master, but she was at a loss when it was impossible to make a call.<br/>
She hurriedly turned back, but the door she came out of had already disappeared.<br/>
<br/>
"Pochi is in trouble nodesu. But Master or Tama should quickly notice and come here nanodesuyo."<br/>
<br/>
Golden Knight Yellow muttered as if she was convincing herself.<br/>
<br/>
--ＬＹＵＲＹＵＲＹＵＵＵ.<br/>
<br/>
The white dragon reported an explosion on the ground to its master.<br/>
There, Ringrande was protecting Hero Meiko behind her back with her broken sword pointed toward the demon lord.<br/>
<br/>
"Some girls are being bullied by a purple monster nodesu!"<br/>
<br/>
--ＬＹＵＲＹＵＲＹＵＵＵ.<br/>
<br/>
"Armor person! Please nanodesu!<br/>
『Yes My Girl. Dimension Catapult Activate.』<br/>
<br/>
One flickering silver board appeared in front of each of them.<br/>
<br/>
"Lyuryu!"<br/>
<br/>
--ＬＹＵＲＹＵＲＹＵＵＵ.<br/>
<br/>
The moment both of them touched the board, they got accelerated to faster than speed of sound.<br/>
The two of them arrived before the sword arm demon lord and the girls, and scooped out Hero Meiko and Ringrande.<br/>
<br/>
Normally it was a speed that should be unbearable for a normal man, but it was made possible due to her master's scheme and magic knowledge, and above all, the tempered steel body of Golden Knight Yellow who played around with a lesser dragon without any equipment.<br/>
<br/>
"D-dragon?"<br/>
"It's Ringraden person nanodesu."<br/>
<br/>
Golden Knight Yellow called her name wrong, but Ringrande whose consciousness was hazy didn't notice it.<br/>
<br/>
『puLL, DAAEgozaru.』<br/>
<br/>
The Golden Knight Yellow who was flying in the sky above was teleported before the sword arm demon lord.<br/>
<br/>
"That was surprising nanodesu."<br/>
<br/>
Golden Knight Yellow blocked the swinging attack of the sword arm demon lord with her holy sword.<br/>
Blue and purple light crossed, the flash and the spark burn the surroundings.<br/>
<br/>
Cliiiink, an ear-splitting sound reverberated, Golden Knight Yellow's ears under her helmet flopped down.<br/>
<br/>
Another sword of the sword demon lord was coming behind her.<br/>
<br/>
◇<br/>
<br/>
"Such attacks won't work on Pochi nodesu."<br/>
<br/>
Golden Knight Yellow turned around and blocked the attack that was coming from her blind side with the second holy sword.<br/>
<br/>
The sword she used to block it is Holy Sword Pochi--contrary to its very cute appearance with its paw-shaped guard, it's the latest original holy sword comparable to the [Divine Gift Holy Sword].<br/>
<br/>
Looks like she's still hiding her strongest fang.<br/>
<br/>
『attackOUTsideCOGnizanceWhYCOuldEvaDEgozaruna』<br/>
<br/>
Sword arm demon lord was surprised to see Golden Knight Yellow blocking its attack when her attention was robbed by the first attack.<br/>
<br/>
"It's the most basic of basic to fight against space magicians nanodesu."<br/>
<br/>
Golden Knight Yellow is looking at the sword arm demon lord with a triumphant look under her helmet.<br/>
Of course, even a demon lord that could freely manipulate space magic was not almighty enough to see the face under the helmet.<br/>
<br/>
Wary of the Golden Knight Yellow, the Sword Arm Demon Lord jumped back with a short-range warp, taking some distance away from her.<br/>
<br/>
"If Pochi can't do that much, Arisa will take all her desert and puddings nodesu. In this world all Yakiniku meal set is delicious nodesu."<br/>
<br/>
She said some nonsensical things midway, but Golden Knight Yellow said that quite seriously.<br/>
<br/>
--ＬＹＵＲＹＵＲＹＵＵＵ.<br/>
<br/>
The white dragon looks anxiously at the two people it's carrying.<br/>
<br/>
"Alright nodesu. Pochi wants Lyuryu to take the two to a safe place nodesu." <br/>
"W-wait. That's a demon lord. You absolutely can't win alone."<br/>
<br/>
Hero Meiko interrupted as she was instructing the white dragon.<br/>
<br/>
"Demon lord nanodesu? That's bad nodesu. Pochi thought that was a monster nodesuyo."<br/>
"I'm amazed that you survived. I guess I should say as expected of a Dragon Knight?"<br/>
<br/>
Golden Knight Yellow didn't listen to Hero Meiko.<br/>
<br/>
"Is demon lord-san a bad demon lord nanodesu? Pochi was told not to fight the good demon lord nodesu."<br/>
"A-are you stupid? Of course all demon lords are bad you know?"<br/>
"The one who says stupid is the real stupid one nodesuyo?"<br/>
<br/>
Sword Arm Demon Lord is staring at their carefree dialogue curiously.<br/>
<br/>
It seems there is no one here who is aware about the violation of a mutual non-interference verbal contract between the Weasel Emperor and the Golden Knight Yellow's master.<br/>
<br/>
After all, Golden Knight Yellow was sleeping when that was talked about, and her master didn't tell her about it after she woke up.<br/>
However, a God not her master is couldn't possibly guess that she, who doesn't have the mean to teleport, would be moved to the weasel empire on a far away side of the continent when he wasn't looking.<br/>
<br/>
In reality though, the weasel emperor had already broken the contract when he asked her master to help his citizens.<br/>
<br/>
"Didn't it attack just now! Only a bad demon lord comes attacking!"<br/>
"Is that true nanodesu?"<br/>
<br/>
Golden Knight Yellow nods at the sword demon lord.<br/>
<br/>
"Can't be helped nodesu. The way of sword is smeared with blood nodesu."<br/>
<br/>
Golden Knight Yellow muttered seriously while looking at the glittering gauntlet of her golden armor.<br/>
<br/>
"I'm going to help. I'm still a hero of Saga Empire. I won't fall behind a native hero who hasn't been given God's Authority."<br/>
"Then here's a healing magic potion for you nodesu."<br/>
<br/>
Hero Meiko drank the the magic potion she got from Golden Knight Yellow without any question.<br/>
She's a typical careless modern Japanese person who hasn't gotten accustomed to another world.<br/>
<br/>
"W-what's this?"<br/>
<br/>
Glitter effects wrap Hero Meiko, all of her wounds are healed.<br/>
Forget about that, even her broken articulation was restored.<br/>
<br/>
"Blood Elixir Rev. nanodesu. Any wound will be healed as long as you haven't died nodesuyo."<br/>
"What's with that doubtful-sounding name."<br/>
"Don't mind, we're in a battle nanodesu."<br/>
<br/>
Hearing Golden Knight Yellow said that, suddenly realizing it Hero Meiko turned around.<br/>
The sword arm demon lord is still waiting.<br/>
<br/>
『dragonUTeeeeDEGOZARU』<br/>
<br/>
Apparently, the sword arm demo lord is preoccupied with the white dragon.<br/>
<br/>
"Lyuryu, take Ringraden person to a safe place nodesu."<br/>
<br/>
--ＬＹＵＲＹＵＲＹＵＵＵ.<br/>
<br/>
The white dragon soars away with Ringrande in its hand.<br/>
The sword demon lord who likes dragons doesn't seem like it's going to obstruct the white dragon's flight.<br/>
<br/>
"Then, let's go nodesuyo."<br/>
『coming DWEEDgozaru』<br/>
<br/>
Blue light envelops the whole body of Golden Knight Yellow.<br/>
<br/>
"Eh? A Native Hero's Unique Skill?"<br/>
<br/>
Hero Meiko seems to be misunderstanding it, but the light just now is not from the usage of Unique Skill.<br/>
<br/>
"Armor person, please nanodesu."<br/>
『Yes My Girl. Dimension Catapult Activate.』<br/>
<br/>
A flickering silver board appeared in front of Golden Knight Yellow.<br/>
The same acceleration board like earlier.<br/>
<br/>
"Body double technique nanodesu!"<br/>
『Physical Mirror Image.』<br/>
<br/>
Golden Knight Yellow split into 64 bodies at three axis.<br/>
Frighteningly enough, the majority of them have mass and magic power.<br/>
<br/>
The sword demon lord who's also a space magician lies in wait for Golden Knight Yellow's attack with traps in ambush.<br/>
<br/>
"Today's sure fire technique Magic Edge Spiral Strike (Vorpal Strike) Exerion, stand by nanodesu!"<br/>
『Yes My Girl. Extra Mode Activate.』<br/>
<br/>
Various reinforcement magic envelop Golden Knight Yellow.<br/>
<br/>
The original name was [Extra Mode] but Golden Knight Yellow is convinced that it's [Exerion] due to a purple haired little girl's scheme.<br/>
The Raka Clone installed in the Golden Armor interpreted that the request was for [Extra Mode] with its fuzzy function.<br/>
<br/>
"W-what's with this reinforcement magic? Unbelievable.... How did my status became three times as high? T-this is like raising your level for several times."<br/>
<br/>
It appears Raka Clone had judged her as a comrade, Hero Meiko also got the effect of Extra Mode.<br/>
<br/>
At the surprised Hero Meiko, Golden Knight Yellow only tilted her head and that was it.<br/>
She probably doesn't really understand what she is surprised about.<br/>
<br/>
"Let's go nodesuyo!"<br/>
<br/>
The 64 Golden Knight Yellow who jumped to the silver board with Flickering Movement appeared before the sword demon lord in an instant.<br/>
<br/>
"Ah, stupid!"<br/>
<br/>
Golden Knight Yellow jumped into the distorted space trap that Hero Meiko evaded in the nick of time earlier.<br/>
The figure of Golden Knight Yellow getting stabbed by her own holy swords flashed in Hero Meiko's mind.<br/>
<br/>
The dark purple light released by the demon lord and the blue light released by Golden Knight Yellow dye the battlefield blindingly.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
