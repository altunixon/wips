<br/>
I’m going to go till I collapse, so I’ll only be reading comments every upload.<br/>
Yes I was slacking the past few days, the motivation just wasn’t there.<br/>
Exploration<br/>
Naofumi:"Be careful."<br/>
Raphtalia:"Okay."<br/>
Raphtalia uses magic to create a ball of light that illuminates the cavern.<br/>
I am in the lead while Raphtalia, Firo, Rishia, and the allied forces follow along.<br/>
Eyeball-like familiars and caterpillar-like familiars were appearing from the walls of the cave, though they weren’t that strong at fighting.<br/>
The problem is this cave……This structure is as complex as a maze……<br/>
The walls aren’t living beings but stone and mud.<br/>
Naofumi:"Do you know the way?"<br/>
Soldier:"More or less, I was assigned to the reserves because I investigated caves in the past."<br/>
Naofumi:"That’s helpful."<br/>
It would take too much time to map this place out from scratch after all.<br/>
We spread open the map to confirm the location.<br/>
As I thought, the cave has a complex maze-like structure.<br/>
The ironic thing is that there is another entrance at the back, where the town was.<br/>
Shit……<br/>
Well, it can’t be helped since I didn’t know. In the first place, it was just Firo and I.<br/>
It would be meaningless if I didn’t meet up with the group that is supposed to seal the heart.<br/>
The problem is…….it seems that the location of the heart isn’t shown.<br/>
Perhaps it could be on the way, unless we can stop the spirit turtle from regenerating, we won’t be able to stop it from advancing.<br/>
Doesn’t seem very reliable huh……<br/>
Naofumi:"Oh?"<br/>
After checking the map, I find a spot that is somewhat bigger than the rest. It would be a good idea to put together a search group and have the rest wait there.<br/>
Honestly, too many people would burden our movement.<br/>
There’s no problem if there were guys that could match Raphtalia and Firo’s level of performance, but it would be cruel to demand the same as these two from the rest.<br/>
Anyway, tricking the allied forces into thinking this is a break would be fine. Let’s go with that.<br/>
Deciding what to do, I mark the large space on the map of the cave, and tell the allied forces the goal.<br/>
Eventually, the space opened up according to what was shown on the map.<br/>
Originally I thought the map was based entirely on guesses, but it might be dependable after all.<br/>
It’s good that we have arrived at our desired location, but……<br/>
Firo:"There’s some huge demon."<br/>
Within the large clearing is a large demon, which has a presence suitable to being the spirit turtle’s familiar.<br/>
It would be useless to compare its huge total length to the other familiars.<br/>
Looks like the purpose of its deployment here at the plaza is to remove invaders like us, it’s like that game called Prisoner’s Base.<br/>
(Tlnote: I’m sure most of you guys played this before in elementary. http://www.gameskidsplay.net/games/chasing_games/prisoners_base.htm)<br/>
It feels like a Mid-boss from RPGS.<br/>
It’s the spirit turtle after all. This should be considerably stronger than the other small fries.<br/>
The problem is the number of them.<br/>
We can still keep our composure with just one, but if there are more it would be dangerous for the allied forces.<br/>
Raphtalia:"Since this is the case. What shall we do?"<br/>
It would be troublesome for another to appear after we defeat this one……Should we just try it?<br/>
Naofumi:"Alright, fortunately there is only one, we will defeat it and then observe the circumstances. You guys in the allied forces, pay attention to the rear."<br/>
Soldiers:"Roger!"<br/>
Firo:"Okay~"<br/>
Rishia:"Fuee……I’ll do my best."<br/>
Naofumi:"Haah……"<br/>
As usual, Rishia said those words I warned her about.<br/>
Well, it’s not like it’s going to stop all the way just because I warned her.<br/>
Right now what Rishia needs is confidence and experience.<br/>
It would be nice if she could act like she did with the queen, I want her to become strong, not only from levels, but also from actual combat experience.<br/>
With that in mind, you could say that the spirit turtle is the perfect opponent for that.<br/>
……Though it’s just a slightly drastic measure.<br/>
Naofumi:"Alright, Charge!"<br/>
We charge towards the familiar that is occupying the plaza.<br/>
This is different from the gorillas and yetis outside…….A turtle-man type? It’s a monster that spans a full 4 meters in length.<br/>
Firo:"Teryaaa!"<br/>
Firo kicks the familiar’s shell with all her might.<br/>
A loud crack resounded and the shell caved in, it was sent flying into a wall and its movements stopped.<br/>
Raphtalia:"Yaaaaaa!"<br/>
With a flash of her sword, Raphtalia cuts off the familiar’s head.<br/>
That familiar is so unreliable.<br/>
Rishia was trying to attract its attention with weak magic attacks, and she also supported Raphtalia.<br/>
In the case that we are targeted, I have the meteor shield up to defend.<br/>
For the time being her understanding of cooperation is lacking. Just a passing mark.<br/>
Or rather, the cooperation itself isn’t a problem. We can expand on that after strengthening her body.<br/>
The problem is that her abilities are affected by her status.<br/>
……What was she concentrating on before?<br/>
Raphtalia:"This thing is quite disappointing."<br/>
Raphtalia swings the blood off her sword after confirming the annihilation of the familiar.<br/>
It was certainly much weaker than expected.<br/>
I mean the spirit turtle was so tough. Was I too cautious?<br/>
No, the allied force is behind me. Being very cautious is just right.<br/>
Firo:"Yup. It was only a little bit hard."<br/>
Raphtalia:"Firo did you kick the hardest place intentionally?"<br/>
Firo:"Because everything else is soft~"<br/>
Raphtalia:"That’s wasted movement."<br/>
The two of them are having a silly conversation.<br/>
It’s like a conversation between a genius and a prodigy.<br/>
Rishia:"The two of them are very strong."<br/>
Naofumi:"Rishia."<br/>
Rishia:"Fuee—–I’ll make that my goal!"<br/>
Hrmm……Put in the effort and strive to get there, don’t just say it.<br/>
This has comepletely become a habit.<br/>
Naofumi:"As for reinforcements……it doesn’t seem like there are any."<br/>
Raphtalia:"Seems that way."<br/>
Apparently there is no trap that causes us to defeat the thing endlessly.<br/>
Soldiers:"Amazing……"<br/>
Our group of allied forces exclaims this to us.<br/>
For us who fought though, I’d say it was weak, but……<br/>
What is the average level of our forces?<br/>
If it’s around level 60 I’ll cry.<br/>
Shadow:"Hero of the Shield-dono."<br/>
Shadow appears. Speaking of which, where were you?<br/>
The knife in her hand was drenched in the blood of familiars, so it looks like she was fighting somewhere else.<br/>
Naofumi:"What happened?"<br/>
Shadow:"I am investigating this place according to the plan degojaru."<br/>
Naofumi:"Right……I mean, why did you come?"<br/>
Shadow:"As per the plan, I was assigned to guard the allied forces degojaru. Other than that, the queen told me to ask Hero of the Shield-dono for orders degojaruyo."<br/>
Naofumi:"That’s fine."<br/>
To have shadow guard the allied forces……For the time being this guy can act as a military unit.<br/>
Are the familiars of the Spirit turtle that strong?<br/>
Well…… I should regard the allied forces as a special unit that seals the spirit turtle.<br/>
I’ll calculate where I should assign our combat ability.<br/>
Naofumi:"Alright! To each of you from the allied forces, I intend to search for the spirit turtle’s heart with this place as a base. It is important for everyone to protect this place. We will begin the search."<br/>
Allied Forces:"R-Roger that!"<br/>
The tension is gone as the allied forces cautiously begin to rest in the plaza.<br/>
It seems they have become considerably fatigued from the extreme tension and continuous fighting.<br/>
I didn’t expect that they would fight till they were this tired……<br/>
Is it the shield’s influence?<br/>
Or is it just that Raphtalia and Firo are strange?<br/>
In any case, without thinking about various things we won’t be able to reseal the spirit turtle.<br/>
Naofumi:"Shadow……Do you know the average level of the allied forces?"<br/>
Shadow:"The average level of the military units for sealing the heart of the spirit turtle is 65 degojaru."<br/>
……It’s not as bad as expected.<br/>
What? Is the difference with growth correction this big!?<br/>
Since Rishia’s stats are so low, is this the standard without growth correction?<br/>
No no, I expect that’s not the case.<br/>
Since Itsuki’s reason for dismissing Rishia is because she is weak.<br/>
……That Rishia at least has some war potential now thanks to the Firo costume.<br/>
Should I ask the old man to make more Firo costumes? There are only two pieces of material required.<br/>
Mass production of the Firo costume huh……<br/>
I wonder if it’s possible by plucking Firo’s feathers.<br/>
Firo:"!?"<br/>
Suddenly Firo’s feathers stand on end restlessly like a wave.<br/>
Raphtalia:"What’s happening?"<br/>
Firo:"Something strange is in the air!"<br/>
I didn’t say anything and she still noticed.<br/>
……What a sharp fellow. It seems plucking her feathers is impossible.<br/>
Naofumi:"Shadow is stronger than that fellow though."<br/>
I know since we fought together a little back on Cal Mira Island.<br/>
Having a unit that is on Shadow’s level is extremely convenient, they should be useful.<br/>
Shadow:"Temporarily, our assassination unit will enter the battlefield degojarukara, we are knowledgable on levels and martial arts degojaru."<br/>
Naofumi:"Then take half of the shadow corps to defend, and the remaining half to search."<br/>
Shadow:"Understood degojaru. That being said, right now there are considerably less shadows degojarukara, please don’t expect too much degojaru."<br/>
Naofumi:"I know."<br/>
The shadows tailing the other heroes are missing……They probably can’t move due to the situation, or dead in the worst case scenario.<br/>
To that extent the allied forces should be more dependable when including them.<br/>
Anyway, the strategy has been decided.<br/>
There is still a long way to go. We will look for the heart as the allied forces take a break.<br/>
Naofumi:"Rishia, you wait here and fight with the allied forces if demons appear."<br/>
Rishia:"U-Understood!"<br/>
Naofumi:"Raphtalia and Firo, you two are searching with me. Firo use your nose. I’ll be relying on you."<br/>
Firo:"Okay~! I’ll do my best~!"<br/>
Raphtalia:"Roger."<br/>
We left Rishia behind and we advanced towards the caves that started to diverge.<br/>
<br/>
