Chapter 342: Interworldly Exchange<br/>
<br/>
"Now then, I’ve got things I have to do too." (Naofumi)<br/>
We want to make the battles of the wave as short as we can.<br/>
Because of Tact, the time between Waves has decreased, and I don’t know how to reset it.<br/>
… No one knows just how many waves we’ll have to survive before an end is in sight.<br/>
For the next few days, we all put our best efforts towards raising our levels and preparing for the wave with our parties.<br/>
Because we are able to utilize all the enhancement methods, despite the fact that all the hunting grounds had a huge level spike, we reach a state where could manage somehow.<br/>
Well, the problem is… the civilians.<br/>
After exiting the castle, even the mob Balloons are over Level 40… My peddling has also become quite a trial.<br/>
Normal people won’t just get away with a few injuries. Even veteran adventurers are struggling.<br/>
Our saving grace is that the amount of EXP received upon their defeat is massive.<br/>
And so, a long line forms outside the Dragon Hourglass every day.<br/>
At night, I receive a report at the castle and find myself overcome with emotion.<br/>
"Balloons… how nostalgic." (Naofumi)<br/>
"Iwatani-dono… I humbly apologize for my actions at that time." (Trash)<br/>
"I have no intentions of forgiving you, but don’t mind it for now. So even the Balloons are Level 40… how troublesome. That place is swarming with Balloons." (Naofumi)<br/>
"What?" (Trash)<br/>
Trash tilts his head to one side.<br/>
What’s with that? It’s as if I said something strange.<br/>
I mean, aren’t they plentiful around here?<br/>
I have a feeling it was quite a while ago, but I spent a whole two weeks out there.<br/>
There’s no way I’m wrong.<br/>
"Even now, the Balloons that populate the Castle Town’s Plains are reported to be quite low in numbers." (Trash)<br/>
"What are you talking about? I set those plains as my base and camped out every night. Whenever I woke up in the morning, my entire body was covered with Balloons biting at me." (Naofumi)<br/>
"That’s strange…" (Trash)<br/>
Trash inclines his head once more.<br/>
Did I really say something that strange?<br/>
I thought their encounter rate would just be high around the starting town, but perhaps I was thinking of this as a Net Game.<br/>
"What’s wrong~?" (Firo)<br/>
Firo barges into the conversation.<br/>
"No, well, I’ve just been told that the plains surrounding the city don’t contain very many Balloons." (Naofumi)<br/>
"Yeah, there aren’t too many. So?" (Firo)<br/>
… Yes?<br/>
Even Firo concurs with Trash.<br/>
"Now that I think about it, whenever I’m with master, I see a lot more monsters." (Firo)<br/>
"… Is that true?" (Naofumi)<br/>
I turn my eyes to Raphtalia.<br/>
I mean, she did spend a long time training in the mountains, so she should be knowledgeable about it.<br/>
"Yes. We encounter them quite frequently when we’re around Naofumi-sama. Now that I think about it, it’s actually quite rare to encounter that many monsters on the highways." (Raphtalia)<br/>
(TL: And that’s pretty much the only place Naofumi trains)<br/>
What is this?<br/>
I have an exceedingly bad premonition.<br/>
"But didn’t Firo encounter loads of monsters when she went to level up the villagers?" (Naofumi)<br/>
"Firo goes to places where a lot of them live. But, I think I would be able to find more if Master was there." (Firo)<br/>
Well, she does run through the mountains, and she does go through their natural habitats… Was encountering so many monsters while peddling due to my own bad luck?<br/>
No, my sales and threats turned out to be quite effective at that time.<br/>
"How about we go and test it out?" (Raphtalia)<br/>
"I don’t really want to…" (Naofumi)<br/>
Stuff like that should be fate and luck. It must be a coincidence.<br/>
Is what I keep telling myself.<br/>
If the entire world doesn’t begin raising its average level, even living will soon become difficult.<br/>
The reason monsters don’t appear on the highway is because Humans are just that troublesome of an existence to them.<br/>
But now, even those roads experience frequent attacks.<br/>
That’s the current state of affairs, apparently.<br/>
We suppressed Zeltburg’s wave, and overcame another one from yet another country.<br/>
By the way, we’ve been able to handle these waves without too much of a problem.<br/>
I was a tad bit disappointed.<br/>
It’s true that the monsters have become visibly stronger, but with all the Heroes working together, it was surprisingly easy to bring them to an end.<br/>
Nothing special to speak of… it was easier than the first wave we faced.<br/>
It’s as if it’s become just another job.<br/>
I was waiting for whoever was naming themselves as God to do some form of divine intervention, but nothing happened.<br/>
Glass went back to her side once and returned yesterday to give a report.<br/>
As the Heroes on that side cannot muster enough power to fight, their situation is taking a turn for the worst.<br/>
Because we’re quickly dealing with it over here, the casualties from the wave are… well, they’re few in number, but there’s still a substantial amount of damage being caused.<br/>
Glass’s world’s vassals are being pressured into strenuous battles.<br/>
They were lamenting that it would all come to an end soon.<br/>
The fact that the war with Faubley was completely over and the fact that Faubley had declared its defeat are ringing around the world.<br/>
The end result is that Melromark became recognized as the world’s greatest Superpower.<br/>
The true identity of the wave seems to have become known throughout our neighboring countries.<br/>
There was also an investigation conducted to see just how much assimilation had come about as a result of the wave worldwide.<br/>
Apparently, around half of Melromark’s land had been assimilated.<br/>
The races of Glass’s world seem to be… accepting the situation.<br/>
Because of the differences in language and writing, there’s still some disorder, but as the Heroes are standing beside them, we’re facilitating them in deepening their understanding with one another.<br/>
For that, today we ended up in a meeting with the representative of Glass’s vanishing world.<br/>
"Hey, Glass." (Naofumi)<br/>
"What is it?" (Glass)<br/>
"What sort of races does your world have?" (Naofumi)<br/>
"Meaning?" (Glass)<br/>
"Well… are there Humans like me, and is there anything different between them and the people of this world?" (Naofumi)<br/>
Honestly, I’m thinking Glass is of a different race than the people of this world.<br/>
In truth, her body occasionally becomes somewhat transparent, so I don’t think she’s quite human.<br/>
If I were to give it a name, I guess it would be ‘half-spirit.’<br/>
There may be some ancient legend about a country where humans and ghosts lived alongside one another or something like that.<br/>
"Now that I think about it, I never spoke about it, did I? Yes. My world also contains Humans. And I am a Spirit… A race called the Soul People." (Glass)<br/>
(TL: Naofumi thinks about the Japanese word for Spirit(霊), while Glass says her race is Spirit with an English Pronunciation(スピリット). Her people are called (魂人) Soul People)<br/>
"Spirit?" (Naofumi)<br/>
"Yes, unlike humans, we can get stronger through Status Magic." (Glass)<br/>
"I’ll ask for argument’s sake, but what do you mean?" (Naofumi)<br/>
"First, to put it simply… the Vitality, Magic, and Spirit Power that exist in humans exist in us as one Stat. We also don’t have levels." (Glass)<br/>
Spirit Power?<br/>
I don’t really get it, but it may be a term for EP and SP.<br/>
"No Level? Then how do you get stronger?" (Naofumi)<br/>
"Soul People measure their strength in something called Energy. That constitutes our Vitality, Magic, Spirit, and Level." (Glass)<br/>
"… Then when you use magic, you use up just as much Stamina and Vitality as you do MP… You mean?" (Naofumi)<br/>
"Something like that. It also influences our Attack and Defense. If there’s too little energy, we will get weaker." (Glass)<br/>
I see.<br/>
That’s why when we first fought her, we were able to defeat her after she had dealt with the other Heroes.<br/>
Or else, there would be no way we would be able to beat the enemy who made a fool out of Ren.<br/>
"By defeating monsters, does something change?" (Naofumi)<br/>
"When we defeat monsters, the Energy of the Land stored inside them… in Human terms, I guess it would be EXP, is absorbed into us as Energy. Well, if we use too much, we can go into negative Energy point values." (Glass)<br/>
"That sounds like quite a troublesome race." (Naofumi)<br/>
"It’s not too bad. It automatically recovers itself every minute, you know." (Glass)<br/>
"Then with time, does your ‘Level’ rise as well?" (Naofumi)<br/>
"For that, I would have to increase the maximum capacity. The amount gained when defeating a monster is able to exceed the maximum capacity I can reach by automatic recovery." (Glass)<br/>
"Fumu, what happens if you use recovery magic?" (Naofumi)<br/>
If Energy is what’s being restored, then the Shield sounds useful for a race like that.<br/>
We could gather healers from around the globe and supercharge people of Glass’s race.<br/>
"Human Magic cannot heal us. Though, we can receive energy from others of our Clan." (Glass)<br/>
"I see… Then…" (Naofumi)<br/>
Well, it doesn’t look like it’ll work out that well.<br/>
I take out Spirit Water from the Shield and toss it at Glass.<br/>
"This water restores something called SP in this world. What happens when you drink it?" (Naofumi)<br/>
"I wonder. Let’s test it." (Glass)<br/>
Glass begins drinking down the liquid.<br/>
"… My energy increased by quite a high amount. This is quite a convenient drink." (Glass)<br/>
"I see." (Naofumi)<br/>
Mass producing Spirit Water is difficult, but it seems that it can strengthen Glass.<br/>
I’ll have all the Heroes start making some later.<br/>
"In exchange, this is a gem from my world. Please accept it." (Glass)<br/>
This time, Glass takes out a red crystal and hands it to me.<br/>
"What is this?" (Naofumi)<br/>
"It’s called a Crystal of the Earth in my world. It’s known to recover Magic. Try gripping it tightly." (Glass)<br/>
As I was told, I squeeze the gem in my hand.<br/>
‘You have accessed the Dragon Pulse! You have gained 3000 EXP!’<br/>
A window like the one that appears after defeating a monster floats before me.<br/>
3000… I guess it’s not a number to be laughed at.<br/>
"I got a bit of EXP." (Naofumi)<br/>
"It seems that different tools have different purposes across worlds. To put it bluntly, that drink from before was truly splendid." (Glass)<br/>
"If I can get EXP just by gripping a Gem, then I’m fine with trading." (Naofumi)<br/>
… It isn’t foreign exchange, but through otherworldly exchange, we can get some items we both want. It may be necessary to overcome the wave.<br/>
In this world, it was a simple SP recovery item, but in Glass’s World, it lets her acquire Energy.<br/>
In Glass’s World, it was just a magic recovery item, but here, it can give you EXP.<br/>
I’ll have to have the Old Man analyze it, but I feel that a wide range of possibilities sleep within these gems.<br/>
"Okay, I understand what Spirits are. Are Spirits and Humans all that inhabit your world?" (Naofumi)<br/>
"No, there are also the People of Crystal, a race of people with gems at their cores called the Jewels." (Glass)<br/>
"What sort of race is that?" (Naofumi)<br/>
I’ve played some games with similar races in them.<br/>
They had a setting where they were targeted and hunted by people for the rare gems that made them.<br/>
From what Glass’s saying, they have equal citizenship, but I wonder.<br/>
"If I had to say… certain gems that collected power gained their own will and wished to be human. As they’re a bit hard to label as Human, they received some discrimination in the past." (Glass)<br/>
"Hmm… Spirits too?" (Naofumi)<br/>
"Yes… in the past, Humans labelled Spirits as Ghosts lingering in the world. There were times when people called to purge them." (Glass)<br/>
"And you’re not?" (Naofumi)<br/>
I feel that Spirits and Ghosts are quite the same.<br/>
Souls and Crystals, they have quite a spiritual feel surrounding them.<br/>
"Spirits are not left by Human souls. We may have similar natures, but we are fundamentally different." (Glass)<br/>
"I see." (Naofumi)<br/>
"Returning to topic, Jewels eat gems, and based on the minerals they eat, they can change the abilities they possess. Their status magic is the same as Humans, though." (Glass)<br/>
"I see… Hmm? How do they reproduce? I don’t know their body structure, but…" (Naofumi)<br/>
"They can spontaneously generate from nature, but they can propagate just like humans, you know?" (Glass)<br/>
Stones multiply… I can’t imagine that at all.<br/>
"There are some coming in the meeting, so confirm it for yourself." (Glass)<br/>
"I got it. Spirits and Jewels." (Naofumi)<br/>
"Also, there’s some of the race that also exist in this world, Demi-Humans, though they’re quite scarce." (Glass)<br/>
"Fumu." (Naofumi)<br/>
By the way, the Demi-Humans Glass was talking about were Elves and Dwarfs.<br/>
Since the ones I know of all have fluffy animal ears, it’s rare to see a human subspecies.<br/>
Would the past me have been overly excited over this?<br/>
