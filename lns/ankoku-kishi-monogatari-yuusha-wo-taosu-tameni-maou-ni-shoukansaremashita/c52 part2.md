Chapter 52.2 : Library of Heaven<br/>
◆Dark Knight, Kuroki<br/>
When I reached that point I stopped reading the emerald tablet.<br/>
There were various stories recorded in the emerald tablet, and one could learn anything just by touching the panel. Moreover, the letters and images shown in it were easy to understand. As there wasn’t any difference from the ones I learned in Nargol, I didn’t have any problem reading the texts recorded in the tablet.<br/>
「It’s the complete opposite from what was written in the human legends huh…」<br/>
I unintentionally muttered my thoughts.<br/>
To begin with, records depicting Modes as the former comrade of Oudith and the rest of the Gods of Elios didn’t exist in the human legends. Thus, there was one God of Elios missing in the human legends. That was the reason that no tales about his banishment could be found in the human legends.<br/>
In addition, there was a part in the human legends that claimed that when the Gods of Elios increased the number of humans in the world, Modes became jealous of the Gods of Elios for making such a wonderful race. Thus, He sent orcs and goblins to destroy the human race.<br/>

<br/>
The legends told to the humans were the exact opposite to the history recorded in this emerald tablet. Then again, could have arisen because the land the humans inhabited now was exactly the land where the orcs and goblins used to live.<br/>
To be honest, I had always felt that the human legends sounded like they were tailored by the gods of Elios. Of course, it was also possible that the content of this tablet was not entirely accurate either, but…<br/>
That kettle of life which was mentioned later in the records might be the magic tool that created Kuna. Although its form was different by the time I used it, the principle code of its operation closely resembled the kettle of life. Maybe Modes brought it with him when the Gods of Elios exiled him to Nargol?<br/>
Then, I thought about the appearance of the Gods shown in the tablet, considering that it seemed to be important. Orgis and Nargol’s appearance weren’t recorded in the emerald tablet, so I had no idea of what they looked like. The same with Mina’s own appearance. But, based on her children’s appearances, which were close to that of humans, Mina’s own appearance seemed to be close to the human race.<br/>
On the other hand, Gods who descended from Nargol had an appearance that was the exact opposite to that of humans. Then again, it didn’t mean that all of Mina’s children were beautiful like the legend stated. For example Heibos, though I felt bad for him, I really couldn’t say that he’s a handsome man.<br/>
The same went for Nargol’s children. Not all of them were ugly. For example, Casa and Sagittarius had beautiful appearances according to the image recorded in the tablet. Moreover, their appearances were close to those of humans despite being Nargols’s children.<br/>
Casa’s upper-half was that of a beautiful woman with hair comprised of feathers, countless numbers of wings grew from her back and lower-half. Meanwhile, Sagittarius looked very similar to the centaurs from his world’s legend. Not only that, Nargol and Orgis also made several beautiful races as well, like the mermaid race and the siren race. Those two races were quite beautiful to behold.<br/>
Nevertheless, I was also curious why so many legendary beings from the legends in my world appeared in this world? However, I might never find out. The truth was a mystery for now.<br/>
While mused about that, I continued to read the content on the emerald tablet.<br/>
After that, the weakened Elios had to face severe predicaments. After all, they had only barely won against the heavenly giant race when they competed for the hegemony over the skies, despite the fact that the heavenly giant race was not a divine race.<br/>
Thus, when Labrys came to Elios, precisely aiming for the time when Oudith was away, the other Gods were not able to do anything to Labrys. They were too weak to do anything.<br/>
It was recorded that, after Labrys laid waste to Elios, he returned to the Minon plain, bringing with him Heibos and some dwarves, who were some of the last to try to escape. Though Oudith, who had just gotten back to Elios, fought Labrys in order to save Heibos, he failed.<br/>

<br/>
After returning to his domain, Labrys turned Heibos and his dwarven aides into his slaves and forced them to make a gigantic labyrinth for him. He then demanded the Gods of Elios to give Rena to him to become his wife if they wanted to save Heibos. The Gods of Elios couldn’t do so though. They couldn’t hand Rena over to Labrys, so in the end, they decided to abandon Heibos to the mercy of fate.<br/>
This decision didn’t sit well with the dwarven follower of Heibos, thus they realign themselves to Nargol to ask for Demon King Modes’ aid. And, Modes heard and heeded the dwarves’ request. He headed to the battlefield alongside his demon race.<br/>
Modes strength was extremely terrifying. His power crushed the huge labyrinth that Heibos created and forced Labrys and his minotaurs to evacuate deep within the labyrinth in fear of Modes’ power. However, Modes’ aim was to save Heibos, so he didn’t pursue the fleeing group and seeked Heibos instead. Unfortunately, while he managed to save Heibos, the same couldn’t be said to Heibos’ aides who were captured along with him. None of them survived.<br/>
This event allowed Modes and Heibos to become close to one another, becoming true friends in the most genuine sense.<br/>
And with Labrys and his minotaurs gone from the Minon plain to the underground, humans decided to take over the plain and reside there. After obtaining a rich plot of lands, the rate at which they increased their numbers was explosive, making them the most thriving race of this world.<br/>
At that point, I stopped reading the emerald tablet. I looked at the magic watch made with crystal and clicked my tongue. I didn’t realize that it was already this late at night, and that I should already be back in Nargol by now.<br/>
So, I went to the girl who was reading a book at a slightly separated place from mine. She was reading a normal book that wasn’t that much different from the books that could be found back in my world.<br/>
Admittedly, there were some books in some human countries that seemed to be made of long thin pieces of wood strung together just like the one that was used in ancient china, but most of the countries used papers to create their books.<br/>
And since there were paper-making tools that were made by the dwarven artisans, the price of the paper wasn’t expensive either. Of course, due to the abundant Phragmites Australis in this world, most of the paper here was made from it.<br/>
By the way, even though it seemed that most of the books in this world would never deteriorate since they were made with special magic fibres, it looked like the emerald tablet in my hand was still quite special in this world.<br/>

「Thank you very much, Totona-dono.」<br/>
The girl looked at me when I called her name. She was an extremely beautiful girl whose hair was braided on her back. And while her appearance could be said to be quite plain compared to Kuna or Rena, her beauty still almost rivaled theirs.<br/>
She was the Goddess of Books and Knowledge, Totona. The librarian of this library, the Elios Library of Heaven. And, she was also the daughter of Goddess Faeria and the King of Gods, Oudith. In short, she was the little sister of that god of war, Thors, that caused Elios’ weakening.<br/>
Rather, according to the tablet I read just a moment ago, he was the RING LEADER himself. Then again, the content of the tablet came from Totona’s knowledge of the events.<br/>
And, while I couldn’t find any inconsistency in the record I read a moment ago, it’s highly likely that the record was inaccurate in some aspects. Especially considering the fact that the events recorded in this emerald tablet happened prior to her birth so she didn’t see them herself. Totona herself warned me about it.<br/>
I mean, Death God Zarxis was still alive, so I’m sure that there’s at least one mistake in the information of this tablet.<br/>
「Is it already time, Dark Knight? 」<br/>
Goddess Totona asked with her usual blunt tone as she took back the tablet from me. At first, I thought that she simply hated me. However, now I knew that Goddess Totona was always an expressionless girl and it had nothing to do with me personally.<br/>
「Yes, thanks to this I managed to understand many things.」<br/>
I bowed to the Goddess Totona.<br/>
It was the day after I received my armor from God Heibos. When I was searching through the Loughas Library, I heard that Elios’ Library stored many more materials and data than his own. Thus, I asked him whether I could visit it or not. Loughas then wrote a letter of introduction for me and told me to hand it to Goddess Totona.<br/>
He told me that Goddess Totona, the librarian of this place, was his former disciple back when Modes was still in Elios. While Loughas followed Modes to Nargol when the latter was banished from Elios, Faeria, Totona’s mother, forbade her from leaving Elios. And, being unable to defy her mother, Totona decided to stay in Elios.<br/>
All I had to do when I met her was to show her my letter of introduction, and just like that, Goddess Totona let me read all the books of the Elios Library without reservation. Moreover, due to its location being close to God Heibos’ residence, I could visit it whenever I liked without being found out. This particular library was filled with all sorts of interesting books and wasn’t limited to paper-based books after all.<br/>

For example, this emerald tablet. From what I could see, each slate of this emerald could record more than a hundred thousands books. And, while I really wanted to borrow it, it seemed that even here, this type of tablet was a rarity. That’s why, if I wanted to read this tablet again, I would have to frequently visit this place. Besides, I was not done reading anyhow.<br/>
