Alan, Selena, and Sharon went out of the room. It seems they want to talk among themselves too. Baron Sergio seems to have something to discuss with me as well, and Captain Dalshim also stayed behind. <br/>
"Please excuse my presumptuousness, Your Royal Highness. But I have some things I want to confirm with you no matter what."<br/>
"What is it, Baron Sergio?"<br/>
"What kind of person is Alan-dono exactly?"<br/>
"…There are some points about him that I and Elna also aren’t clear about. First, it’s certain that he isn’t from this continent. When we first met each other, he couldn’t speak our language, and we couldn’t understand each other in the beginning." <br/>
"Truly? But he seems to be quite fluent in our language though."<br/>
"Alan is a talented man. He came to this continent via ship, apparently. He is most probably a soldier. He personally told us he was a soldier, and that those twins were his subordinates.  Their ship sank, and they have lost their way to get back to their country. I have heard that apart from using a ship similar to the one that sank, it was impossible for them to cross the oceans to come back to the continent they are from."<br/>
"To think that there was still a continent that had people living in it apart from this one. It is an astonishing revelation." Captain Dalshim exclaimed. <br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
"Your Highness, I shall ask this directly then. Can Alan-dono be trusted?"<br/>
"So that is what you want to truly ascertain. Honestly, I was also surprised when I first heard about Alan’s plan to create a new country, but personally speaking, I do think Alan is trustworthy. I have no doubt of that. What do you think, Elna?"<br/>
"I also agree that Alan is trustworthy. He is a wonderful individual. It is even more pronounced once he considers you one of his own." <br/>
"Just what kind of background does he have?"<br/>
"That is something that remains a mystery, even for us. I have discussed it with Elna, but we haven’t come up with anything concrete. But there was one time when one of the twins, Selena, let something slip. Even after hearing my status, I heard her something along the lines of"A mere princess of a kingdom is incomparable to His Excellency’s esteemed self." That means even a princess of a country cannot compare to his status. Do you comprehend the implications of this?"<br/>
"A mere princess of a kingdom is incomparable to him, is it? Does that mean that he is royalty of a large and powerful nation?"<br/>
"By the Goddess! So he was someone of such esteemed standing!? If that is the case, then I can see where his confidence in proposing to create a country and taking in more than five thousand people as citizens comes from."<br/>
"I have asked Alan directly one time, and strangely, he claims to be neither part of nobility or royalty."<br/>
"Not of nobility or royalty? If so, seeing as he’s part of the military, perhaps he is a general of high standing?"<br/>
"I and Elna also think so. However, can a general really outshine a princess in standing?"<br/>
"Well, perhaps that is the case in the continent they are from. However, if Alan-dono truly is a general of such caliber, then it is nothing but good tidings for our cause! I can feel our goal of gaining back our kingdom looming ever closer to reality!"<br/>
"That is absolutely right! This is a chance that is hard to come by."<br/>
"You Highness, just what is Alan-dono’s goal in proposing to unite the whole continent?"<br/>
"According to Alan, it’s all for the well-being and prosperity of the people. He will create a country in order for the people to learn about the things around them, discover the underlying principles of the world, and let the people live rich and fulfilling lives. These are the words that Alan said himself. He claimed that this is all that he wants."<br/>
"Oh! Such a noble-sounding cause!"<br/>
"And do you believe his words, Your Highness?"<br/>
"I do not see any reason to doubt them for now. And judging from Alan’s behavior until now, I honestly do not feel there is any falsehood in what he says."<br/>
"Your Highness, there is one other matter that I wish to confirm with you. Once we have created a country, which one between you and Alan-dono will hold the right to govern?"<br/>
"Baron Segio! Of course it should be Her Royal Highness, right!?" Captain Dalshim exclaimed. <br/>
"No. After discussing things with Alan, we have decided on a co-rulership. However, Alan has some things he cannot compromise as well. He wants full authority over deciding the country’s educational policies as well as the matters regarding the unification of the continent. Apart from these two matters, everything else will need to be discussed with me." <br/>
"……Cleria-sama, in other words…?" Elna pressed on.<br/>
I felt my face grow hot in embarrassment. <br/>
"Yes, it’s as you think. Alan and I have decided to walk hand in hand."<br/>
""Oooh!""<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
"I did not think you have already come to such a momentous decision during your talk! I suppose this warrants some congratulations, my princess?" Elna teased. <br/>
"Yes, well, whether or not this turns out to be a good thing depends on our success in founding a country for ourselves, but I admit that it doesn’t feel bad."<br/>
"Oh! If that is truly the case, then our position is all but set in stone! There can be no better beginning than this!"<br/>
In order to cover up my embarrassment, I moved to discuss the three conditions I put forth with the three of them.<br/>
"So it seems that Alan-dono truly believes that he can take back the Starveek Kingdom." Captain Dalshim pointed out.<br/>
"Of course. Alan will not lie when it comes to things like this. And strangely enough, I cannot help but believe that Alan will be able to accomplish what he sets out to do."<br/>
"Yes, I feel the same, Cleria-sama."<br/>
"But I do wonder how he will accomplish such a thing?"<br/>
"That I have no idea. However, Alan’s strength speaks for itself. What you witnessed today was but a small part of his power. Elna, how many soldiers do you think is needed in order to defeat Alan?"<br/>
"Do you mean an Alan who has fully prepared himself?"<br/>
"That’s right. Let us assume you will battle in an open plain."<br/>
"In that case, at the very least, I will need two hundred heavy cavalry and one hundred royal guards on horseback."<br/>
"Wha-!?"<br/>
"Hou. How do you propose to attack then?"<br/>
"First, I shall have the heavy cavalry assault him at full speeds from the sides. Though I believe heavy cavalry will be no match for Alan in the end, if we surround him with two hundred of them, I’m sure it will allow us to tie up his movements for a short while. I shall then have the royal guards follow the heavy cavalry closely and make their assault, letting them shower spells at Alan. We shall make use of the chaos in order to forcefully snatch up a victory."<br/>
"I see. But that plan still largely depends on luck."<br/>
"Please wait for a moment! Dame Norian, are you seriously saying that we need three hundred men on horseback in order to defeat a single man!?"<br/>
"If we are up against a fully prepared Alan, then even three hundred may not be enough."<br/>
"Yes. I am of the same opinion. He is just that powerful."<br/>
Well, if Alan uses his rifle, then we will need a significantly larger force in order to win. <br/>
"By the Goddess! To think he was that powerful! How impressive! He is much like the heroes spoken of in legends! And he is now offering to be our ally… My princess! Then our struggle? Our country?"<br/>
"I have already said it earlier didn’t I? Alan will surely accomplish what he set out to do."<br/>
"Ah… Praise be to the Goddess Ruminas."<br/>
<br/>
When dinnertime came, I went down to the dining room and found Cleria and the rest already sitting on the largest table. <br/>
"Oh! Alan-dono! Please, sit here."<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Baron Sergio offered the seat right next to Cleria.<br/>
"Thank you very much, Baron Sergio."<br/>
"There is no need to address me as Baron Sergio, Alan-dono. I have already lost my lands and my former status, so there is no meaning in that title. Please, just call me Roberto."<br/>
"I see. Thank you then, Roberto-dono."<br/>
"Alan-dono! Please, just address me as simply Roberto." <br/>
"Err… Thank you, Roberto."<br/>
"That goes for the others as well. Please feel free to address me as Roberto."<br/>
Man, Baron Sergio, uh, Roberto’s tension is strangely high.<br/>
After a little while, Sara-chan finally brought out the dishes for tonight’s meal. Oh, so tonight’s dinner is karaage and tonkatsu huh. Since there’s karaage, then Verse must have gotten some Black Bird meat earlier. It’s been a while since I’ve had it, so I was looking forward to the meal. <br/>
