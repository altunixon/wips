    <p>Thank you, everyone, for purchasing the third volume of 『Cooking with Wild Game』.</p>

    <p>Before I realize it, the number of volumes increased again.</p>

    <p>This is thanks to all the readers who had supported me so far.</p>

    <p>And this time, I’m very honored that the author of 『School-Live!』 Norimitsu Kaihō has written a comment on the book’s band.</p>

    <p><a id="noteReturn4"></a>Speaking of Norimitsu Kaihō sensei, the party scene he wrote for a certain anime left a deep impression on me.<a href="../Text/Notes.xhtml#ftn4" epub:type="noteref">[4]</a></p>

    <p>The female characters adorned their dresses and danced more energetically than usual, and displayed a sensual side of them, unlike their usual self. In my description of the wedding, that scene would show up in my mind from time to time.</p>

    <p>However, the banquet in my story had an unexpected ending… Asuta fell asleep before the girls started to dance. When this part was posted online, one reader commented with: 「This main character is too dense!」.</p>

    <p>Anyway, Asuta’s life in another world is going to start officially.</p>

    <p>I hope everyone can look forward to future installments of this series.</p>

    <p>Then, as usual, I want to thank my editor from Hobby JAPAN, the illustrator, all the staff involved in the publishing of this work, and the readers who bought this book.</p>

    <p>I hope to see everyone in the next volume!</p>

    <p>May 2015, EDA</p>
