Arifureta After III   Urgent Thanks Planning   Yue’s Diary ③<br/>
<br/>
※AN: I posted a chapter before this chapter, so please pay attention.<br/>
When I woke up this morning, I received a lot of comments congratulating me for Arifureta’s anime, so Shirakome is really terribly grateful.<br/>
And so, this is only a short chapter that I wrote in two hours, but allow me to post a short thank-you story for the congratulatory comments.<br/>
No, I was really happy (^ ^)<br/>
<br/>
–<br/>
――December ○ Day<br/>
It seemed that in Japan the last month of the year, December, is called ‘shiwasu’. (TN: Shiwasu = 師走, the first kanji means ‘teacher/mentor’ while the second kanji means ‘run’.)<br/>
When I asked Hajime the meaning of it, he said that the end of the year will be busy because of various things and that even a "teacher" who is usually calm will be running around busily, something like that? That was what Hajime taught me. It seems he doesn’t know the exact reason though.<br/>
I see.<br/>
Busy……<br/>
Busy, is it……<br/>
–<br/>
――December X Day<br/>
Tio and Remia are looking very busy as of late.<br/>
It seems that the clothing and jewelry shop they are managing together is really booming. It looks like they are going to be opening a shop dedicated to kids within the year, and for the start of it, they will be doing something like a kids’ fashion show.<br/>
It seems that Myuu will serve as the vanguard for that.<br/>
Today too they were making Myuu try on clothes for the fashion show one after another. Myuu was floundering while nearly drowning.<br/>
Fumu……<br/>
Adorable! Surely an angel will descend at the end of the year fashion show!<br/>
–<br/>
――December △ Day<br/>
Recently Kaori is looking busy, so I cannot really prank her.<br/>
Damn you, even though you are just Kaori, but making light of me like this, how cheeky.<br/>
I hear that she is following around the Yaegashi family that wants to end the dispute within the year or something. It seems that quite a lot of injured people are appearing, so she is busily serving the role of healer.<br/>
Come to think of it, Shizuku is making a really tired face isn’t she……<br/>
As expected from the Yaegashi family. Them being a combat race isn’t just for show.<br/>
……<br/>
……I wonder, will both of them quickly get free time……<br/>
–<br/>
――December @ Day<br/>
Recently Hajime isn’t giving me attention.<br/>
It seems that Otou-samafather-in-law’s company is now like a scene of carnage.<br/>
It looks like they want to release the newly created game within the year. Both father and son won’t come home.<br/>
Lonely……<br/>
And so, today I’m going to be bringing them supplies.<br/>
I dislike going to Otou-sama’s company, but……this is in order to stay by Hajime’s side.<br/>
I am Yue. Even if the staff-sans of Otou-sama’s company came praying to me as though I am a founder of a new religion each time they meet me, or even if I’m really troubled when they come worshipping saying 「The healing came! Our goddess of healing has descended!」, I am a woman who won’t withdraw for the sake of my husband!<br/>
Although, it’s troubling that it becomes such a great commotion every time, so this time I’m putting on the glasses of recognition obstruction.<br/>
I was noticed normally.<br/>
「Glasses girl Yue-sama has descended!」 Like that it became a great commotion.<br/>
Otou-sama said 「Yue-chan, thank you for coming! Everyone is half-dead already, but this is a more effective vitality restoration than an energy drink or caffeine! We can still fight!」 happily, so I’m glad but……<br/>
Perhaps I should say that it’s as expected from the subordinates of Otou-sama.<br/>
For them to easily ignore the recognition obstruction artifact of Hajime’s……<br/>
Hajime is frequently saying 「Just how in the world……」 while tilting his head in puzzlement.<br/>
Anyway, after that, Hajime cared for me a little, so I’m satisfied.<br/>
It seems that the battle against deadline? is still continuing.<br/>
I sent an encouraging yell of ‘thank you’ for their hard work before going home quickly, but if I can say my true feelings, I wish he would finish quickly and stay by my side.<br/>
–<br/>
――December # Day<br/>
Shia crossed over to Tortus.<br/>
I hear that the Hauria clan is quarreling with the empire. She is going to assist with resolving it.<br/>
I asked her if I should help out, but she said 「It’s okay. If it becomes troublesome, then I’ll just mow down both sides!」 before she energetically slipped through the gate.<br/>
It looks like she will be staying on the other side for a while.<br/>
When the mood maker Shia is gone, as expected, the Nagumo house feels like it becomes quiet somehow.<br/>
……Damn Shia.<br/>
How cheeky of her to leave me behind.<br/>
Even though I told her that I’d help out, it should be fine not to refuse……<br/>
–<br/>
――December ☆ Day<br/>
The occasion of everyone being away from home came often.<br/>
Because it’s Decembershiwasu.<br/>
Because they are busy.<br/>
Because, they are busy……<br/>
……<br/>
……<br/>
Eh? I’m, not busy though?<br/>
–<br/>
――December ◇ Day<br/>
Aaa, I’m reeeally busy!<br/>
In place of everyone who is away from the house, I’m doing the cleaning, the washing, sending things to them, aaa, I’m reeeally busy!<br/>
–<br/>
――December □ Day<br/>
I said a lie.<br/>
I’m not busy, at all.<br/>
Because, when I’m thinking of doing something, it will generally be over in a flash when using magic.<br/>
Because the electrical appliances of the Nagumo house are artifacts, it doesn’t take effort or time at all.<br/>
Today too, everyone except me seems busy……<br/>
–<br/>
――December $ Day<br/>
Right now, I am flapping around, rolling around on the bed, while writing in my diary.<br/>
Then, I suddenly thought.<br/>
Could it be I’m……<br/>
A NEET?<br/>
–<br/>
――December ※ Day<br/>
Today, I tried asking Okaa-samamother-in-law.<br/>
Am I, a NEET vampire princess? I asked.<br/>
Okaa-sama was dumbfounded. Then she exploded into a laugh so great she rolled around on the floor.<br/>
I don’t understand.<br/>
According to Okaa-sama, the cheat heroine vampire princess from another world, getting bothered that she might be a deadbeat is just too surreal, and it hit right on her funny spot.<br/>
Okaa-sama was laughing with teary eyes.<br/>
For now, I’m sitting in the corner of the room, hugging my knees, while facing the wall.<br/>
I’m feeling like not wanting to do anything for a while.<br/>
–<br/>
――December ☆ Day<br/>
Okaa-sama is inviting me while grinning widely.<br/>
Amazingly, it seems that the shoujo mangagirl comic Okaa-sama is working on will get an anime. It appears that she is busy with various things, like the preparatory meetings and the like. She told me that she wants me to become her assistant, doing secretarial things.<br/>
What consideration.<br/>
Okaa-sama! I love you! The vampire princess gets a job!<br/>
I am the assistant Yue. The perfect secretary of Okaa-sama!<br/>
I cannot stay like this. In order to become useful for Okaa-sama, first I have to fix my appearance properly! This isn’t the time to wear a sulking jersey!<br/>
–<br/>
――December 〒 Day<br/>
Today, I accompanied Okaa-sama to work.<br/>
It’s strange to say it myself, but I believe that I was a perfect secretary.<br/>
I became the adult version using metamorphosis magic, wore a stylish suit smartly, I also bundled up my hair crisply, and put on sharp glasses as insurance runs. No matter from where and how anyone looked, it was the secretary Yue.<br/>
Not just appearance, I casually guessed what Okaa-sama was looking for using soul magic and made preparations ahead of time.<br/>
In order to give the other party a good impression, I smiled a lot more than usual.<br/>
Even if I don’t have the needed thing in hand, I could take it out quickly using space magic.<br/>
……How dreadful.<br/>
My own perfect way of working is dreadful!<br/>
Perhaps being a secretary, is my hidden vocation.<br/>
But, what concerned me though, was how Okaa-sama was smiling wryly for some reason, and it felt like all the staff-sans of the other side had their gazes fixed on me the whole time……<br/>
……<br/>
……Okaa-sama. Is secretary Yue, not needed anymore?<br/>
–<br/>
――December ♪ Day<br/>
O Nagumo house! Everyone came home!<br/>
Their expressions were tired, but it seemed that everyone finished their business safely.<br/>
It became a gathering of the whole family after so long.<br/>
I heard various stories from them. It looks like everyone had it difficult.<br/>
……Having the whole family present is happiness.<br/>
There is no doubt that I’m happy.<br/>
No doubt about it, but……<br/>
It feels like the fundamental problem isn’t resolved.<br/>
Is it mistaken for a vampire princess of another world to be a NEET?<br/>
Thinking that, at night, I went to consult Hajime.<br/>
I’m anxious about the future. Is it all right for me to stay a NEET like this? Should I do something like a part-time job?<br/>
Hajime rolled around with laughter. Damn you, Hajime. Even though I consulted you while enduring shame that almost broke through the heavens. The reaction of parent and child is really similar.<br/>
Like that, when I stared at Hajime resentfully, Hajime apologized 「My bad, my bad」 while he also apologized 「It was my bad that I made you feel lonely」.<br/>
It was a fact that I was lonely, but it’s not like he needed to apologize for that.<br/>
Just, I only thought a bit if I too can say 「I did xxx」, then how nice would that be?<br/>
When I told him so, Hajime talked with a preface of 「Yue is unexpectedly a person who is brimming with curiosity, so isn’t it fine if you try your hand at everything from A to Z that caught your interest? And so basically……」, and then he,<br/>
「’I’m a fulltime housewife’, isn’t it fine even if you say that?」<br/>
Sheesh Hajime, he said such a thing while looking a bit embarrassed.<br/>
It felt like the scales had fallen from my eyes.<br/>
Housewife. Fulltime housewife. The yamato nadeshiko wife who is waiting for her husband’s return!!<br/>
The murkiness in my heart cleared up all at once.<br/>
I am Yue. The cheat fulltime housewife vampire princess!<br/>
For now, as the duty of the housewife, I’ll push down my husband and receive him deliciously.<br/>
–<br/>
<br/>
