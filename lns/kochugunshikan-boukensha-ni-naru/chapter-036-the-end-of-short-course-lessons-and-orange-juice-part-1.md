<br/>
It’s been twenty days since I’ve started taking the magic tool manufacturing short course, and today is the final day. <br/>
I was able to learn the contents of the magic tool manufacturing short course, which usually takes twenty days to be discussed, in just ten.  <br/>
However, the branch chief kindly let me practice making my own magic tools using the equipment and facilities in the guild building in the remaining ten days. <br/>
I already planned to try my hand at building functional magic tools on my own when the short course ended, but it really is a big help to be able to use the facilities at the guild which is equipped with all the essential stuff needed for magic tool production.<br/>
I’m particularly grateful to the chief for introducing me to a workshop that was able to produce alloy and glass parts that I was incapable of making on my own.  <br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
"I finally finished it, chief. This is the magic tool I developed that is used to automatically mix stuff."<br/>
I have been working on it since morning. I excitedly showed the fruit of my labor that was just completed a bit earlier to the branch chief who was on the first floor.  <br/>
"That’s wonderful! So you’ve completed it. Congratulations Alan."<br/>
"Thank you very much. This is also thanks to your masterful guidance, chief."<br/>
The magic tool I made can be used both as a food processor and a mixer. It can handle both functions by swapping parts.  <br/>
I thought it would be a tall order to produce this thing at first because I didn’t know of a way to produce a proper industrial grade mechanical seal or ‘packing’. But the chief told me she knew of something like it when I consulted her. The packing I ended up using was actually produced from the specially processed and hardened body fluids of a monster called Slime.<br/>
The basic principle was to use the Wind spell in place of an electric motor to make the fins or blades spin in order to mix or chop ingredients.  The Wind spell is able to provide enough power to make the tool practical.  <br/>
Of course, the Wind spell alone was not enough to produce an acceptable spinning speed, so I made two differently-sized gears in order to shore up the speed. <br/>
The gears and the impeller that would catch the wind produced by the spell in order to power the magic motor could not be produced in the Guild’s facilities. So I had to improvise by using my electromagnetic bladeknife, laser gun, and a hammer in order to DIY the said parts. <br/>
I was particular with using glass in order to produce the cup that would be used to contain ingredients.  It would be more convenient to see the state of the ingredients inside the container when processing them after all.  The glass wasn’t 100% transparent and was a little bit cloudy instead, but this really can’t be helped. <br/>
Of course, I also put in some safety measures in order to prevent injury while using the tool. I made it so that a specialized rod was needed to be inserted and pressed inside the lid in order to properly connect the magic circuit.   In other words, in order to use the magic tool, one needs to insert the rod on the lid, secure the lid on top of the glass cup and press the rod even further downwards in order for the magic motor to start spinning.  I’m proud of the safety features of this thing. <br/>
I’m really satisfied with it. The mechanical blueprint and the magic circle were both designed by Nanom though. They were designed and made with absolute precision in accordance with Nanom’s standards – down to the millimeters.	<br/>
I opened up the magic tool and explained how it worked to the branch chief. <br/>
Next, I’ll have to do some practical live tests.  I got some fruits resembling oranges from Verse earlier for use in the tests.  I peeled one up and tried it. It tasted as expected and was very sweet and delicious.  <br/>
I peeled up some more and put them all inside the glass cup. This much should be enough for the chief, Lily, and me. <br/>
I secured the lid on top of the cup and turned the magic motor on.  The alloy blades inside started turning at high speed.  …That should do it, I guess.<br/>
I took the three drinking cups I had Lily prepare earlier and poured the finished orange juice inside them.   Let’s try taking a sip. <br/>
Delish! It’s been a while since I had some orange juice. There are some pulp and skins left mixed in, but it was still tasty. It would be nice to strain it once by using a colander next time. <br/>
"Alan-san! This is really tasty! It’s my first time having such a refreshing drink!"<br/>
"It really is quite good, Alan. I’m honestly surprised you were able to produce a magic tool of this quality."<br/>
"My cooking repertoire will expand some more now that I have this thing."<br/>
"Alan, you said you were an adventurer right? Just where did you learn your production skills from?"<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
What to do? I should just make something up, I guess. <br/>
"My parents loved making all sorts of things, so I ended up learning quite a bit from the two of them."<br/>
"Is that so? You’ve done an amazing job. It would be hard to believe that a person who just managed to finish the basic magic tool manufacturing short course is able to produce such a high-quality magic tool if one didn’t witness it in person."<br/>
"It’s because you’re really good at teaching, chief."<br/>
"……Alan. Though it may seem inconsiderate of me to ask you of this just as you’ve finally completed it, would you consider selling this newly invented magic tool to our Guild?" <br/>
"Um, what do you mean?"<br/>
"This magic tool incorporates several new and innovative techniques.  For example, these gears, this part that catches the wind, and this set of rotating blades.   They are more than worthy of researching further."<br/>
Oops. Did I overdo it, perhaps? Come to think of it, the blacksmiths in the workshop didn’t know about gears either.  I see. By creating gears and the impeller, I may have introduced things beyond the current technological level of this planet.  <br/>
"Uh, how much are you planning to pay for them anyway?"<br/>
"……Two hundred thousand Guineas.  In addition, we will also promote your Guild rank to A."<br/>
Two hundred thousand Guineas! That much!? That’s a lot of money for just a piece of simple cookware.  But maybe they’ve also included things like the patent and technical fees.  Even if I subtract the cost of materials and the commission fee for the parts I couldn’t make myself, I’d still make a profit of about a hundred and fifty thousand Guineas. <br/>
But why would they promote me as well?<br/>
"Why would I get promoted too?"<br/>
"The skills needed for making this magic tool more than qualifies you for A rank.<br/>
We will also consider this as an accomplishment that contributes greatly to the development of the Magic Guild.<br/>
It’s often misunderstood that one needs to have great skill in magic in order to get promoted in the Magic Guild. But in truth, skills in magic tool creation, research, and development are valued more highly and have a greater bearing in a member’s promotion.  <br/>
There’s even an extreme case of someone getting promoted to S rank despite the person not having any ability to cast magic at all."  <br/>
I see. But will getting promoted to A rank net me any nice perks? <br/>
"You’ll get a thirty percent discount when purchasing materials and components from the Guild once you get promoted to A rank." <br/>
Looks like she read my mind. A thirty percent discount does sound nice.<br/>
I did go through all sorts of trouble in order to build this after all. But since I was planning on making another one for Verse anyway, I had enough spare parts left to make another one whenever I wanted to.   Guess I’ll sell this one then. <br/>
"I’ll prepare two hundred fifty-thousand Guineas then. I won’t be able to bring out an amount greater than this without consulting the main Guild Headquarters first." <br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Perhaps the chief thought I was still not convinced so she upped the price. <br/>
"No, two hundred thousand Guineas is more than enough.<br/>
In exchange, can I get a preview of the contents for the advanced magic tool making short course along with the corresponding magic tomes? <br/>
I’m honestly having second thoughts about whether or not to enter the advanced course. I think I’ll be able to make a more informed decision once I get a peek of the course contents." <br/>
"That’s absolutely no problem." <br/>
Great! I’ll be able to have Nanom save the contents of the magic tomes. I do feel a bit bad for the Guild and the chief, but let’s just say that I used the fifty thousand Guineas I refused earlier to get access to the magic tomes.  <br/>
Well, since I decided to sell it, I guess it would be proper to include notes about the things they should pay attention to in the manufacturing process.   The chief ended up being really pleased at my offer. <br/>
It seems she was now heading out to the Commerce Guild in order to withdraw the money for my payment.  So the Commerce Guild also accepts deposits?  I wonder if the money earns interest.  <br/>
