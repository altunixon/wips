Chapter 58.3 : Goddess Of Spider<br/>
◆Dark Knight Kuroki<br/>
「Are you… sure about this?」<br/>
I unintentionally let out a verbal slip.<br/>
「Is something the matter, Kuroki?」<br/>
While linking her arm with mine, we walked together before Rena asked this question.<br/>
She was currently wearing a hood to hide her face.<br/>
Moreover, we were currently walking in the main streets of the Republic Ariadya. A transcendent beauty like Rena would be bound to cause a huge commotion if she people were to notice her.<br/>
Chapter By WordExcerpt<br/>
Though, I think that she would still stand out even with her face hidden, fortunately, we were at the center of Faeria’s faith, it was normal for women here to hide their faces.<br/>
「Well…. I mean, with Shirone and the others doing an investigation, is it really okay for us to do this?」<br/>
Shirone and company should be in the middle of investigating Quiche river right now.<br/>
Can we really stroll about without a care in the world like this?<br/>
Moreover, I was also worried about the lizardmen’s conditions. They did tell me that they would stop trying to get their revenge on humans…<br/>
But still… I couldn’t help but be anxious about this.<br/>
I mean they did start revering me as if I was their God. I originally didn’t have any intention to save them, nor did I want to in the first place. I was plainly worried that their promise to me might backfire on them.<br/>
I felt disgusted due to my own indecision in this matter.<br/>
「It isn’t like they forbade us to do anything. Let’s just put our faith in them, moreover, isn’t your apostle with them too?」<br/>
Rena said with a smile on her face.<br/>
Chapter By WordExcerpt<br/>
This was also another thing that I was uneasy about. How did she know that Regena was my apostle? I mean… not even Shirone was aware of this fact.<br/>
Regena commanded the lizardmen in my place, they seemed to be quite obedient towards her too.<br/>
「Hah\~ Come to think of it, is it really okay to sneak out like this?」<br/>
In a normal situation, Rena would’ve been surrounded by numerous bodyguards right now. However, she currently didn’t really have them to protect her.<br/>
As for why we were strolling around right now, it’s because Rena told me that she wanted to see the human world.<br/>
She didn’t bring any bodyguard along since it would make us stand out in the crowd.<br/>
Nevertheless, I thought it should’ve been okay if we brought along one or two bodyguards. Rena seemed to detest this very idea.<br/>
As expected, her bodyguard wouldn’t let her go without anyone to protect her either. Thus, Rena sneaked out of the inn, bringing me along to go with her.<br/>
「It’s okay. I don’t need any other bodyguard as long as I have you. Won’t you become my knight just for today?」<br/>
Rena said as she pulled me closer to her.<br/>
Right now, I wasn’t wearing my armor. My outfit only consisted of a normal set of clothes for daily use. I could clearly feel Rena’s soft and bouncy breasts squishing on my left arm.<br/>
「Well… sure enough, it shouldn’t be a problem for me to become your knight just for today, but… are you really sure about not bringing any of your bodyguards?」<br/>
I had to ask her this since she sneaked out.<br/>
I mean, she would naturally get rejected if she asked to go out alone.<br/>
As for the reason why I was accompanying Rena in her tour, it was to repay her for providing help in saving Shizufae.<br/>
Her simple request was to stroll in a human city with just me and her together.<br/>
It was still a mystery as to why she asked me of all people, aside from other matters, I had nothing to lose by accepting such an easy request. This was why I agreed with her.<br/>
「Don’t worry about it. Rather than that, what’s the matter with you? You’ve been walking with such a strange gait since a while ago.」<br/>
Rena questioned with a curious look on her face.<br/>
DAMMIT! LIKE HELL I COULD TELL HER THAT IT WAS BECAUSE SHE WAS PRESSING HER CHEST ON MY ARM.<br/>
And thanks to that, I couldn’t walk properly since a certain body part of mine became as hard as a rock.<br/>
「No, it’s nothing…. Anyway, where are you going to take me?」<br/>
Ariadya was one of the most prominent metropolises in this world. I wonder where she was stringing me along…<br/>
「Oh my, isn’t that your duty? You did a research about those kind of places on your own, right?」<br/>
「…Eh? How did you know?」<br/>
She was right, I did various investigations about the sightseeing spots in Republic Ariadya.<br/>
I mean, it was natural to research about these kinds of things if you came to a metropolis. I even bought a tour guide book. Thankfully, it was cheap thanks to the dwarves that made the printing tools.<br/>
However… How did she know that I have a tour guide book?<br/>
「Why you ask? It’s because I saw the guide book when I entered your room.」<br/>
Rena explained as if it was the most natural thing to do in the world.<br/>
「Ah, I see… Wait, no! YOU ENTERED MY ROOM!?」<br/>
「Yeah, should I not have?」<br/>
「It isn’t on the matter that you ‘shouldn’t’…」<br/>
Where was my privacy? Though she shouldn’t be able to find that… I still can’t let my guard down.<br/>
「Well, don’t mind such trivial matters, let’s get going. Now then, where are you going to take me first?」<br/>
Rena muttered with her sweet and enchanting voice.<br/>
I swallowed any complaints I had when her face neared mine.<br/>
Okay then! To the back alley, I mean she doesn’t seem to like this place.<br/>
…Cough, I was joking. Let’s stop thinking about these kinds of silly ideas.<br/>
「Uhn, let see…. Which place should we visit first?」<br/>
I erased all the evil ideas I had while pondering about this thought.<br/>
The first place that came to my mind was the giant public bath.<br/>
Ariadya’s giant public bath wasn’t just a bathing facility, there were various amusements that were built around it. It might be the best choice to play around.<br/>
But… there’s a problem. Since the giant public bath is dedicated to Faeria, it has an extreme restriction towards men. It’s an inappropriate place to go since men and women are separated when we enter the area.<br/>
Because the arena was still closed down and the theatre has yet to raise its curtain, where should I take her?<br/>
「How about Traid’s fountain?」<br/>
「Traid’s fountain?」<br/>
「Yeah, it’s a dwarven-made fountain which was created as the water facility terminal of this country. At the center of the fountain is a splendid sculpture of the Sea King; Trident is surrounded by beautiful mermaids.」<br/>
Ariadya’s water service facilities were made by the dwarves.<br/>
The Traid’s fountain was made as its main terminal.<br/>
The Sea King, Trident, was a water god, the fountain was also built as an offering for him.<br/>
「Hu\~hm, an offering for Trident, huh? I can’t think too highly of the fountain that was made as an offering for THAT… I don’t really mind as long as I come with you.」<br/>
Having said that, a while later, we finally arrived at Traid’s fountain.<br/>
It was an extremely splendid fountain. The water made from the service terminal looked as if it came from a natural spring. The sculpture of the Sea King, Trident, was located right in the center of Traid’s fountain, it was surrounded by beautiful mermaids.<br/>
The splendid sculpture was crafted by dwarves based on a blueprint from a famous designer.<br/>
Traid’s fountain was one of the most famous tourist attractions here. From the people’s appearances alone, I knew that they were from outside of Ariadya.<br/>
「Kuroki. Do you know what they’re doing?」<br/>
Rena asked me as she looked at some of the tourists doing something.<br/>
They were throwing a coin into the fountain.<br/>
「Ah, they’re wishing1Wishing well for something.」<br/>
「Wishing… for something?」<br/>
「Yeah, there’s a certain belief here that says your wish might come true if you throw a coin into the fountain. Do you want to give it a try?」<br/>
Having said so, I took out a Teycam copper coin from my pocket.<br/>
Teycam was the currency issued by Republic Ariadya. The Ariad Union aside, it could also be used in the Holy Republic Lenaria and other regions.<br/>
「Humans sure are strange… You make a wish by throwing something like this?」<br/>
Rena said as she looked at the copper coin.<br/>
In fact, from Rena’s point of view, currency was an unusual thing.<br/>
Divine beings never used money in the first place, nor did they ever need it.<br/>
They could get almost anything they wanted without even having to use something like money. If it was something they truly wanted to get, it would be an object that was too valuable to have a price tag attached to it. These were a few of the reasons why they didn’t need money.<br/>
「By the way, there’s also a superstition here that says when a man and woman throws a coin together, they will be blessed to be side by side forever.」<br/>
Rena let out a surprised gasp when I told her this myth.<br/>
「I’ve never heard this kind of magic before.」<br/>
Rena shook her head as if she couldn’t believe what she just heard.<br/>
「It isn’t magic…. But well… It’s sort of like a notion that’s spread amongst the humans.」<br/>
I had no better words to explain this myth.<br/>
「This actually makes it even harder to understand…」<br/>
It seems that things like superstitions were nonsense for Rena.<br/>
「Uhm… I myself feel that it’s okay to believe in myths like these sometimes. Well, at least I wouldn’t dismiss it as complete nonsense out of nothing.」<br/>
I placed my copper coin back into my pocket, it isn’t like I could force her to believe in human superstitions either. But still, I felt kind of lonely inside.<br/>
「Wait a minute, Kuroki. It’s true that I don’t understand the logic behind this action, but it doesn’t mean I don’t want to do it.<br/>
Rena stopped me from keeping the copper coin.<br/>
「I see.」<br/>
I took out the copper coin again with a wry smile on my face. Well, it’s true that leaving this area without doing anything would defeat the purpose of coming here.<br/>
「Kuroki, don’t you think that it’s better if we threw a gold coin instead?」<br/>
「…EH!?」<br/>
I was speechless at what she just said, could it be that she didn’t hear my explanation a while ago?<br/>
Refusing her right now would be like pouring cold water onto her enthusiasm.<br/>
I placed the copper coin in my pocket and took out a gold coin.<br/>
「Let’s throw it together, Kuroki.」<br/>
Rena’s snow-white hand grasped on my hand that held the gold coin.<br/>
「E-Eh… Rena?」<br/>
Thus, just like this, the bewildered me threw the gold coin into the fountain with Rena.<br/>
The coin drew a parabolic orbit before dropping right in the center of the fountain.<br/>
「Fufufu, humans know how to make a good superstition.」<br/>
Although her face was hidden beneath her hood, I knew that she was enjoying this.<br/>
I felt relieved knowing this.<br/>
To be honest, I had zero experience in this regard. Learning that she was enjoying her time was enough to make me feel elated.<br/>
But then again, was it really okay to do this with someone who wasn’t Reiji? I mean… she was supposed to love him right?<br/>
Well, it doesn’t really matter now, this kind of thinking will only spoil this rare moment of spending time together with a beauty.<br/>
「Kuroki, where are you going to take me next?」<br/>
「Let see…」<br/>
I started thinking about the next place to visit.<br/>
