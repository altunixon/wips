Out of school–I am now a NEET.<br/>
Chapter 340: Enhancement Methods [Middle]<br/>
<br/>
"Next, let’s continue with large weapons. Midori, you’re up." (Naofumi)<br/>
"Ah, yes. The Axe’s enhancement is… let’s see, it seems to be Body Modification." (Midori)<br/>
"What’s that?" (Naofumi)<br/>
"According to the Help, besides weapon bonuses, you can distribute points freely to your own status." (Midori)<br/>
So it has nothing to do with weapons. The Vassal Enhancement methods sure are broad.<br/>
I confirm my Status with magic.<br/>
There it is… around the stats portion.<br/>
More specifically, around Defense, Agility, and Magic, an arrow mark appeared.<br/>
When I slowly concentrate on it, a window pops up.<br/>
‘Will you distribute Stat Points?’<br/>
I have quite a bit of points saved up. It’s like those old games where you can distribute stats to your liking.<br/>
This is… can’t I increase my attack so that I can fling myself at enemies!?<br/>
Thinking that, I try to distribute points into Attack.<br/>
But there is no arrow next to the Attack stat…<br/>
I fell to my knees, and took on the pose of despair.<br/>
(TL: Zetsuboushita!)(ED: Orz)<br/>
Shield… why must you crumble my hopes so?<br/>
Thinking about how badly Tact failed to use the Shield when we were beating him up, I realize that I must have been forced into playing on lunatic mode!<br/>
It seems that Agility would be useful, but I wonder what I should do.<br/>
Ah, it seems resetting is possible.<br/>
But like the Cane and Gauntlets, there’s a certain cooldown time.<br/>
This one is long. It takes three days before you can reset again.<br/>
"Is that it?" (Naofumi)<br/>
"No… it seems there’s something else there." (Midori)<br/>
"Eh?" (Naofumi)<br/>
When I tried to exit out of the point allocation screen, something resembling a grid work appears.<br/>
□□□□□<br/>
□□□□□<br/>
□□□□□<br/>
□□□□□<br/>
□□□□□<br/>
What is this?<br/>
As I thought that, the points I input takes physical shape on the board.<br/>
■■<br/>
■<br/>
Could it be that I’m supposed to mess with the points on this board? It’s a puzzle!<br/>
As expected, if I don’t make the correct shape with the inputted points, the strengthening won’t take effect.<br/>
"Father-in-Law!" (Motoyasu)<br/>
"What is it, Motoyasu?" (Naofumi)<br/>
"I want to distribute all my points en masse, but should I?" (Motoyasu)<br/>
"… I can’t guarantee that you won’t die, but knock yourself out." (Naofumi)<br/>
Oh right, I think that in Motoyasu’s game knowledge, weapons were but ornaments and status determined everything.<br/>
"Understood. Then I’ll maintain some balance in stats." (Motoyasu)<br/>
"I recommend raising Agility so you can execute countermeasures for enemies more easily."<br/>
It’s a longstanding custom for agility to be the focus of strategy.<br/>
Of course, increasing Vitality is also important. Especially when working solo.<br/>
The problem is that neglecting agility will make it so that I won’t make it to defend in time.<br/>
This will require some research and experimentation.<br/>
By the way, thinking about what would happen if I drastically invested points…<br/>
■■■■■<br/>
■□■□■<br/>
□□■□□<br/>
■■■■■<br/>
■■■■■<br/>
Most of the Grid Panels were filled up. This strengthening seems to be based on Cellphone Games.<br/>
"As expected of Father-in-Law! You pick things up quickly!" (Motoyasu)<br/>
"No, I think anyone would be able to pick this up." (Naofumi)<br/>
But… it’s a plainer enhancement method than expected… right?<br/>
And wait, I’m getting more bonuses than what I inputted.<br/>
It seems the arrangement can create some effects. What’s more, alongside stats, there are also resistance bonuses and special effects.<br/>
This may be a higher priority than equipment bonuses.<br/>
"Midori." (Naofumi)<br/>
"What is it, Master?" (Midori)<br/>
(TL: Midori uses Goshujinsama in Katakana)<br/>
"Make sure you don’t put everything into attack. You’ll end up killing Motoyasu." (Naofumi)<br/>
"Why would I be doing such a thing!?" (Midori)<br/>
"I mean, you’re…" (Naofumi)<br/>
One of Motoyasu’s three stalkers.<br/>
Ah, Stalker 1 and Stalker 2 are glaring at Midori with envy.<br/>
"Why does only Midori get a weapon?"<br/>
"Mokkun is all of ours!"<br/>
Midori’s broken into a cold sweat.<br/>
He’s worried about getting alienated from his group.<br/>
They always fought together, but because of this weapon, they’re going their separate ways.<br/>
What will happen from now on… I’m a little anxious.<br/>
Kuu is a Filo Rial Queen who uses Kicks and breathes fire, right?<br/>
Marin throws her feathers like darts and uses long-ranged magic.<br/>
Midori swings around an axe in human form and uses magic.<br/>
Having the Axe Vassal weapon fly to Midori is an inevitable result.<br/>
Isn’t it just that there wasn’t an axe wielder besides Midori around at the moment?<br/>
"Rafu~?" (Raph-chan)<br/>
Skillfully sitting on top of Raphtalia’s hammer, Raph-chan tilts his head to observe the scene.<br/>
What’s with his reaction?<br/>
A few glances were exchanged, but nothing really happened, so the conversation continued.<br/>
"Now then… Firo." (Naofumi)<br/>
"What~?" (Firo)<br/>
"It’s your turn." (Naofumi)<br/>
"Ah, I see. Um, you know… My skills you see~! They get rea~lly strong!" (Firo)<br/>
Yep, you’ve lost me.<br/>
I was an idiot for asking Firo.<br/>
What should I do… I don’t get what the claw does at all.<br/>
The only one who can have a genuine conversation with Firo is Melty, I guess.<br/>
No, does Raphtalia work too?<br/>
"Raphtalia, ask Firo about her enhancement method." (Naofumi)<br/>
"U-understood. Firo?" (Raphtalia)<br/>
"Yes~?" (Firo)<br/>
"Can you explain it a little better?" (Raphtalia)<br/>
"Hmm? If you do it again and again, then Bang!" (Firo)<br/>
"Someone, anyone!? Call Melty over!" (Naofumi)<br/>
This isn’t getting anywhere.<br/>
After a while, Melty appears, and she speaks with Firo a number of times, after which, she arrives at a conclusion.<br/>
"Putting together Firo’s words, apparently, Skills that can only be used by Heroes, as well as Magic, are given a proficiency level, and they can get stronger with continued usage." (Melty)<br/>
"Oh… how amazing. I’m surprised you were able to get that much out of the girl." (Naofumi)<br/>
I truly admire how she was able to understand that much from the conversation.<br/>
As expected of Firo’s best friend, and lover.<br/>
No… I have a slight hunch, but Melty… No, is that just my imagination?<br/>
"Naofumi, why are you fantasizing about something strange?" (Melty)<br/>
"No, well Melty, are you-" (Naofumi)<br/>
When I was about to ask, Motoyasu interjects.<br/>
"Gununu… I have no choice but to accept it. Your qualifications of being Firo-tan’s fiancé!" (Motoyasu)<br/>
"You can stay silent!" (Melty)<br/>
Melty shut Motoyasu up with a single phrase.<br/>
But that’s fine. The result is advantageous.<br/>
I truly applaud her efforts.<br/>
I confirm my skill list.<br/>
… Besides the Gauntlet and Staff’s strengthening icon, a new bar with a % sign appears. Next to it is a number indicating skill level.<br/>
This number will probably rise with continued use.<br/>
If I increase the level of my Float Shields, would the shields get bigger?<br/>
I won’t know until I test it out.<br/>
"Next is…"<br/>
Going in turn, I turn my eyes to Rishia.<br/>
She changed from the possessor of a ephemeral armament to the true possessor of the Projectile.<br/>
I guess the weapon had used the legendary bow as a medium, through which, it analyzed her compatibility.<br/>
But because Tact existed, it was only able to grant half its power, so it was left in a form like that.<br/>
"Rishia." (Naofumi)<br/>
"Y-yes. My Help menu mentions something about using up money to do something called Over Custom!" (Rishia)<br/>
An excited voice escapes from her mouth. Even though she’s climbed her way up to being a Hero, she still doesn’t have it all together.<br/>
I’m a bit worried about leaving her as Itsuki’s guardian.<br/>
But Itsuki himself has become calm and collected.<br/>
"…"<br/>
"And what exactly is that supposed to mean?" (Naofumi)<br/>
"Well… I don’t have the slightest idea, but… I can use physical currency to strengthen myself. But apparently, it holds no meaning if I don’t know any other enhancement methods…" (Rishia)<br/>
"So it’s a unique, yet generic method… is it not?" (Itsuki)<br/>
"Fumu, as expected of a Jack of all Trades…" (Naofumi)<br/>
It matches Rishia’s way of life.<br/>
I see, I kinda get it.<br/>
"That’s right." (Itsuki)<br/>
"Fuee… why are you all nodding to yourselves?" (Rishia)<br/>
Money…<br/>
Right, I don’t think I’ve ever put any money into the Shield.<br/>
I slowly insert a single copper coin.<br/>
A clinging sound echoes through my head, and an icon displaying ‘1G’ appears in my vision.<br/>
… Let’s try silver.<br/>
The same sound comes, and the icon changes to ‘101G’.<br/>
I bring up the Axe’s strengthening screen.<br/>
The grid’s sides are a pain.<br/>
■□<br/>
■■<br/>
Is there nothing I can do to extend it?<br/>
‘Do you want to invest some money?’<br/>
Ah, a window pops up.<br/>
… I reluctantly press ‘yes’.<br/>
A bar appears, requesting the amount, and I input 101.<br/>
■■<br/>
… Well, I didn’t really input that much, so while the shape changed, that’s about it.<br/>
It’ll probably work on other enhancement methods as well.<br/>
I found it out later, but the Whip’s Strengthening method, Synthesis Measure, is able to increase the amount of ○’s on weapon synthesis.<br/>
How convenient.<br/>
Next is… Protector, a method that eliminates the chance of failure for the Refining method of the Four Heroes. It seems a bit redundant.<br/>
The amount of money we waste is tremendous!<br/>
Screw this, you bourgeoisie!<br/>
Though it’s useful, this isn’t some goddamn Freemium.<br/>
