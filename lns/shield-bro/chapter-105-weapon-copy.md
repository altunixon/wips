CHAPTER 105: WEAPON COPY<br/>
That day, I went back to the inn and tried feeding ingredients into my shield. An Icon popped up.<br/>
For now, I want to make a basic Heal pill.<br/>
…To make one pill, the mix time is 5 minutes.<br/>
It seems the required time increases based upon the level of the recipe.<br/>
5 minutes later.<br/>
A chime sounded off, and the system message, ‘Mixing Complete’ appeared before my eyes.<br/>
I confirm the result.<br/>
–<br/>
Heal Pill<br/>
Quality: Normal<br/>
–<br/>
Did it come out as ‘Normal’ because the materials used were bad? No, the quality decreased too much<br/>
I’ll try using better materials.<br/>
–<br/>
Heal Pill<br/>
Quality: Normal<br/>
–<br/>
I ran some more tests, and it seems that the Quality is stuck at normal.<br/>
So even if all I have is ‘Poor’ materials, I will be able to make ‘Normal’ goods? This might be a good source of profit.<br/>
And the shield can make medicine while I do other work.<br/>
The quality might increase if I raise my level.<br/>
Well, right now, the Queen is sponsoring my living costs, so I don’t have to worry about money though.<br/>
"Master, what are you doing?" (Firo)<br/>
"? Firo, huh." (Naofumi)<br/>
"Yeah" (Firo)<br/>
As I test a lot of things in the Carriage, Firo wanders over.<br/>
At the inn, Firo is usually either in the room, or in the carriage. If she has free time, she will come over to the carriage.<br/>
"Master, Firo was about to kick the person who was doing strange things in Firo’s carriage" (Firo)<br/>
(TL: Referring to Naofumi)<br/>
This bird is saying some scary things. Well, I guess I can trust her to guard my merchandise at least.<br/>
Is seems that Firo really treasures this carriage. Every morning, she comes and does maintenance on it.<br/>
Normally, the Iron Carriage would rust in the sea air, but due to her daily maintenance, that doesn’t seem to be an issue.<br/>
It may be because we have taken a break from peddling, but the bird had a lot of free time. The Carriage is way too clean.<br/>
It’s so polished that it is reflecting light like a mirror. The carriage itself seems to shine.<br/>
For a Filo Rial, the carriage is a precious item. If someone is messing around in it in the night, there is no surprise that she will come and check.<br/>
By the way, though she can do maintenance, she cannot do repairs.<br/>
Whenever something starts to look off, Firo comes shouting to me to fix it.<br/>
"Is Master going to sleep in the Carriage tonight? Let Firo sleep with you~." (Firo)<br/>
"Wrong, I’m just testing a few things." (Naofumi)<br/>
"fu~n" (Firo)<br/>
I guess I should go to one of the weapon vendors on the island… Now that I think about it, it’s already midnight.<br/>
I guess tomorrow is fine too.<br/>
After this, I will try reinforcing my equipment. I’ll try modifying a normal shield.<br/>
"Welcome back. What happened? Did you have any progress?" (Rafatalia)<br/>
When I returned to the room, Rafatalia asks this to me.<br/>
"I learned quite a bit. I still need to test a few things, so I will be busy tomorrow." (Naofumi)<br/>
"That’s good. Will we be making an honest effort to raise our levels starting tomorrow?" (Rafatalia)<br/>
"Well… I have to… I guess we could do that." (Naofumi)<br/>
I can get some monster drops as well.<br/>
I’ll look for some monsters that look like they will drop something useful.<br/>
"Please step back." (Naofumi)<br/>
"Yes………?" (Rafatalia)<br/>
Rafatalia tilts her head and steps backwards. I had previously found a sword. I try to take it out of the shield.<br/>
With a bang, the sword falls out of the shield and hits the floor.<br/>
"Wa!" (Rafatalia)<br/>
Rafatalia lets out a sound of surprise.<br/>
"W-what is this?" (Rafatalia)<br/>
"It’s something that a monster left behind." (Naofumi)<br/>
"A monster was holding something like this?" (Rafatalia)<br/>
"Now then…" (Naofumi)<br/>
The monster that droped this was… Brown Pill Rabbit.<br/>
I analyze the item.<br/>
–<br/>
Iron Sword<br/>
Quality: Normal<br/>
–<br/>
Well it was a small fry.<br/>
"Rafatalia, your sword is starting to rust. Please use this for a while." (Naofumi)<br/>
"Ah, Yes. Thank You…?" (Rafatalia)<br/>
Picking up the mysterious sword, Rafatalia critically looks over it.<br/>
Firo starts to sniff it.<br/>
"It smells like Pill Rabbit" (Firo)<br/>
Wow. She got it right.<br/>
As expected of a Filo Rial. Even though she looks like this, she is still a monster.<br/>
Well, I guess tomorrow will be fun.<br/>
I looked through my drops, set my shield to produce some random medicine, and went to sleep.<br/>
The next morning.<br/>
I wake up, eat a light breakfast and go off to look for a weapon store.<br/>
They have them. A wide variety of shields.<br/>
"Can I look at this for a bit?" (Naofumi)<br/>
"Go ahead." (Weapon Dealer)<br/>
The price is really high. Probably because this is a tourist attraction.<br/>
Or because a lot of adventures have been visiting as of late.<br/>
On its off season, I wonder how the islanders make money.<br/>
Do they sell monster goods? There are some unusual ones here.<br/>
I don’t really want to imagine cooking with Magenta Frog Meat.<br/>
Does this Island even have an active economy? I’ll ask the Accessory Merchant later.<br/>
"Naofumi-sama?" (Rafatalia)<br/>
"Ah, Rafatalia, Firo, please wait a bit." (Naofumi)<br/>
"Okay…" (Rafatalia)<br/>
"What is master doing?" (Firo)<br/>
"Just Wait, you’ll see." (Naofumi)<br/>
I take one of the Shields hung on the wall and touch it to the Legendary Shield.<br/>
Beep. An icon appears in my field of vision.<br/>
Weapon Copy activated.<br/>
–<br/>
You have unlocked the Iron Shield<br/>
You have unlocked the Red Iron Shield<br/>
You have unlocked the Pink Iron Shield<br/>
You have unlocked the White Iron Shield<br/>
You have unlocked the Brown Iron Shield<br/>
You have unlocked the Blue Iron Shield<br/>
You have unlocked the Sky Blue Iron Shield<br/>
Etc… (TL: looks like the Hero can accessorize.)<br/>
–<br/>
I unlocked the Iron Shield… and all its color variations…<br/>
Now that I think about it, my initial Small Shield did have color variation as well. At that time, I didn’t really care, as it didn’t unlock any extra stats.<br/>
I question the usefulness of such a system.<br/>
I wonder if the balloon shield also has such function. I have still yet to unlock that shield.<br/>
The monster came in Orange and Red variety, there might also be a Normal variety.<br/>
Anyways, I repeat the process for the other shields in the shop.<br/>
Round Shield, Buckler, Knight Shield, Copper Shield, Bronze Shield, Steel Shield, Gold Shield… There were also things like Leather Shield.<br/>
It also seems that all the store’s shields have color variation as well.<br/>
The amount of shields I had greatly increased. I didn’t feel like going through all the bonuses.<br/>
They all probably only raised stats, so there shouldn’t be too much of a problem.<br/>
Some skills may have been mixed in, but going through all these shields will take time.<br/>
"I guess that’s it." (Naofumi)<br/>
"What?" (Shop Vendor)<br/>
The Weapon Dealer tilts his head and stares at me.<br/>
Though the store’s inventory wasn’t the best, I still got a lot of shields.<br/>
Once I finish leveling up here, I’ll go see the old man at the weapon shop. He probably has a better selection. (TL: Referring to SmithBro)<br/>
"Have you found something that interests you?" (Store Vendor)<br/>
"? No…" (Naofumi)<br/>
Now that I think of it, I got some useless weapons with the Monster Drops. I’ll try to sell them.<br/>
"Please wait for a second." (Naofumi)<br/>
I go to a place where the vendor cannot see me and take out some weapons from the shield.<br/>
"Would you be interested in buying this item?" (Naofumi)<br/>
"Sure, can you let me appraise it?" (Vendor)<br/>
I hand over the Bronze Spear I had taken out to the Vendor.<br/>
"It seems to be quite solid. There also seems to be a minor enchantment on it…" (Vendor)<br/>
The dealer can see things that I can’t.<br/>
"It doesn’t appear to have an inscription, so the price will drop a bit. Is that okay with you?" (Vendor)<br/>
"Is there supposed to be an inscription?" (Naofumi)<br/>
Now that I think of it, it makes sense.<br/>
If someone famous made it, there should be a way of telling. Something like a signature.<br/>
"It’s in good condition, so the price shouldn’t drop too much. But where did you acquire this item?" (Vendor)<br/>
"That’s a secret." (Naofumi)<br/>
If this person had been suspicious of me, I would have played it off by lying, but we haven’t reached that level yet.<br/>
So it’s a weapon without a maker…?<br/>
"Wait, if I look closer, there is something like an inscription on it… It looks like a shield." (Vendor)<br/>
Was there something like that?<br/>
"Some smith probably made it while thinking of the legendary heroes." (Vendor)<br/>
"Things like that can happen?" (Naofumi)<br/>
"Yes, long ago, weapons like these popped up all the time. Even now, they sometimes come up. Many Smiths admire the Legendary Heroes and inscribe their creations with their Marks." (Vendor)<br/>
"Then this mark won’t really raise the price will it." (Naofumi)<br/>
"That would be correct. Though the quality is good, one who would put such a mark on their creations is simply a dreamer without a name." (Vendor)<br/>
The Vendor’s appraisal is a bit troubling.<br/>
"Well, an adventurer drawn to the magic of the Awakened Islands will probably buy it. I’ll take it for 20 Silver coins." (Vendor)<br/>
"Understood" (Naofumi)<br/>
I give some other Items to the Weapons Vendor. My total profit is 90 Silver Coins.<br/>
If I had discovered the drop system earlier, I could have probably inproved Rafatalia’s equipment early on… But there’s nothing I can do about that now.<br/>
After I left the Weapons Shop, I changed my Shield to an Iron Shield and look at the equipment bonuses.<br/>
Ah, it seems the Iron shield comes with a Skill<br/>
–<br/>
Iron Shield 0/10 C<br/>
Ability… Equipment Bonus: Shield Bash<br/>
Skill Proficiency 0<br/>
This is obviously an offensive skill.<br/>
I can’t wait to see it in action.<br/>
"Um… That shield looks like the one that was being sold at the store but.." (Rafatalia)<br/>
"Ah, the legendary weapons can copy the abilities of weapons sold at the store. That way, if a hero finds a good weapon, he will actually be able to equip it." (Naofumi)<br/>
"That… Seems a bit like stealing." (Rafatalia)<br/>
"It’s not like I’m taking the item, I’m just making a copy of it. And what am I supposed to tell the store vendors?" (Naofumi)<br/>
"…yeah…" (Rafatalia)<br/>
Well, I also have complicated feelings about it.<br/>
Is this like pirating games and manga online?<br/>
It’s like bootlegging a movie at the theater to watch later. (TL: No Moa)<br/>
It’s a crime, isn’t it. Yeah it is.<br/>
But this is an alternate world. Mine didn’t have anyone with legendary weapons.<br/>
And in this world, the one who gets fooled is at fault.<br/>
I won’t complain about it, and I won’t avoid doing it.<br/>
I mean, the other three are doing it as well…<br/>
I do feel like I’m doing something bad… but I have to get used to it.<br/>
I think The Old Man will happily let me copy his shields if I ask.<br/>
I think the other heroes probably stopped at his shop and copied all his weapons first.<br/>
I’ll have him make more equipment for Rafatalia as compensation.<br/>
"Next, let’s go to the market place." (Naofumi)<br/>
I’ll see if they are selling any of the Enchantment Gems that Motoyasu and Itsuki were talking about.<br/>
I wonder how much they will cost.<br/>
The result: very few people actually sold them.<br/>
They mostly only carried the Gem I had already got from Rishia. Its name was the Prani Ore.<br/>
I had already cleared the conditions to unlock the Prani Shield when I tried the weapon enhancement technique Itsuki had talked about. It gave +1 Defense.<br/>
Unfortunately, it seems that my Chimera Viper Shield requires a different Ore.<br/>
When I checked the Help Screen later, the required information had appeared.<br/>
–<br/>
About Reinforcing<br/>
You can reinforce an item up to the denominating number, which has a minimum of 5 . However to strengthen stronger items, you will need more valuable items as ingredients.<br/>
(TL: i.e., if a shield says 1/20, reinforcing will take it to 2/20 and 20/20 is the maximum)<br/>
–<br/>
And these ingredients seem to only be made by people with high Steel-working skills. But with my skills, it seems that I am able to extract Prani Ore by myself.<br/>
Originally, Prani Ore is a soft, cheap, malleable metal that is used to increase the volume of gold products.<br/>
It made something like Gold Alloy, if too much Prani was added, the value would decrease.<br/>
It seems Itsuki was able to feed it to his bow to produce other valuable ingredients.<br/>
I will probably have to learn some Metal Working Skills. That way, I could mold the items sold by stores into more valuable materials.<br/>
"Then, should we go hunting?" (Naofumi)<br/>
"Yes" (Rafatalia)<br/>
"Yeah!" (Firo)<br/>
We’ll finally be able to do some honest-to-goodness level grinding.<br/>
And I can see the effects of my new shields.<br/>
My expectations are quite high.<br/>
"Now then, go quickly! Your body’s still in good condition, isn’t it? *Achoo*" (???)<br/>
"Mother. I can do it, relax!" (???)<br/>
"……" (Naofumi)<br/>
I hear a familiar voice from the market place… But I won’t turn around.<br/>
<br/>
