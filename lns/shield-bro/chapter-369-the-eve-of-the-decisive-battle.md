Chapter 369: The Eve of the Decisive Battle<br/>
Making sure Trash was sound asleep, we quietly left the room.<br/>
When we descended the castle stairs, we found Glass, Ren and Female Knight. Also Itsuki and Rishia. They were meeting up to discuss the coming battle.<br/>
It’s dependent on Trash’s plan, but to what extent can we take action… in the battlefield, what sort of attacks could we expect from our enemies. That sort of talk.<br/>
"Ah, Naofumi-san." (Itsuki)<br/>
Itsuki notices us, and calls out to us.<br/>
"It’s a bit sudden, but I’d like to have a little talk about our enemy." (Itsuki)<br/>
"It’s because Ren-san didn’t know much about our world’s situation." (Rishia)<br/>
"Yeah, that’ll help." (Naofumi)<br/>
Even if I had a slight grasp of what was going on, I can’t just go about using my powers for something like this.<br/>
It’s not yet the time to use them.<br/>
And so, it’s much more efficient to just ask for whatever information they have on the enemy.<br/>
"We were just in the middle of that conversation with Ren-san. But he really did grow big. I was quite surprised." (Rishia)<br/>
Rishia looked at me, turned to Ren, and spoke.<br/>
"He’s grown quite splendidly, hasn’t he?" (Rishia)<br/>
"R-really?" (Ren)<br/>
"No, he still has quite a way to go." (Female Knight)<br/>
Female Knight crossed her arms, and said it with a proud tone.<br/>
Even so, between Ren and Female Knight, there’s a strange sense of distance, or some sort of uncomfortable atmosphere. Something like that.<br/>
Glass seems to have noticed the gap as well. She’s a bit troubled.<br/>
Ah, right. She was fighting in our camp.<br/>
"No matter how big he’s gotten, I have yet to see if his heart’s grown as well! After this, I plan to have him show me his swordsmanship." (Female Knight)<br/>
"Ah, I see. Ren has it hard." (Naofumi)<br/>
"Fight on, Ren-san." (Itsuki)<br/>
Itsuki encourages Ren in a clear voice, but… for some reason, it souned like he was muttering to himself.<br/>
"Until now, Ren was the youngest of all of us, but now that spot has fallen to me." (Itsuki)<br/>
Now that I think about it… Ren was sixteen, so in two years, he’s become eighteen.<br/>
Itsuki was seventeen, I believe.<br/>
I’m twenty, and Motoyasu is twenty one, so Itsuki is the youngest among us.<br/>
Well, through my wanderings through the rift, I don’t really know my actual age anymore, though.<br/>
But I’ll keep that to myself.<br/>
"Ah, right. I thought I should give this to you guys." (Naofumi)<br/>
I take out the medicine Arc gave me, and showed it to Ren.<br/>
"I think this was the liquid from the Filo Rial’s Holy Land, right?" (Ren)<br/>
"It’s the concentrated version. Try feeding it to your weapon. Whatever you do, don’t drink it. It’s poison." (Naofumi)<br/>
It’s a medicine that turns you into a god if you drink it… but I know it isn’t something that shoud be used so readily.<br/>
In the first place, even from this world’s perspective, it’s a foreign object.<br/>
It’s an exception among exceptions.<br/>
Even the current me is probably an exception from the world’s perspective.<br/>
… When this battle is over, what should I do?<br/>
"I see… understood."<br/>
As I inclined the vial to one side, Ituski took out his bow, and absorbed the drop that fell.<br/>
"This is… the Bow of XØ? How is it different from the Bow of Ø? Its effects and stats are the same." (Itsuki)<br/>
"I think it’ll be much more effective on the Bitch Goddess than the Ø Series, you know. When the time comes, try using it." (Naofumi)<br/>
"Understood. Then you will be spreading this medicine around to the other Heroes, too?" (Itsuki)<br/>
"Yeah, tomorrow. Before the battle starts." (Naofumi)<br/>
After giving some to Ren and Rishia, I looked towards Glass.<br/>
"Glass, do you think it can be used on the weapons from your place?" (Naofumi)<br/>
"Hmm… I don’t really know." (Glass)<br/>
"I guess we should just test it." (Naofumi)<br/>
I dripped the medicine onto Glass’s fan.<br/>
"The Fan of XZero…" (Glass)<br/>
So in Glass’s world’s weapons, the name gets written out?<br/>
Even so, it’s good it came out.<br/>
"Next is…" (Naofumi)<br/>
I explained whatever information I thought necessary, and we organized our information.<br/>
And since our business with it was over, I closed the bottle. I mean, it would be terrible if it were to be abused.<br/>
It’s supposed to give some godly power, but once you get the power, what sort of end awaits you?<br/>
… Even I don’t know what the future holds for me.<br/>
The God Slayer who called himself Arc told me.<br/>
That no matter what happened, I shouldn’t regret.<br/>
It’s probable that he was implying this.<br/>
When this battle is over, what will become of me and Raphtalia?<br/>
"And? Your enemies… in this case, do you have anything to say about the Reincarnators?" (Naofumi)<br/>
"Yes. Of the ones we fought, I thought I should tell you two about the cost conspicuously strong ones we encountered." (Itsuki)<br/>
"Got it. Please tell me." (Naofumi)<br/>
The Reincarnators are like that Bitch Goddess’s vassals.<br/>
No, they’re just her pawns.<br/>
Do they understand that once she’s done playing around, she’s going to erase the world all at once?<br/>
No, if they did, I doubt they would be acting like this.<br/>
"First is about Glass’s world’s vassal Heroes. There are five we’ve encountered." (Itsuki)<br/>
Glass was the Fan, right?<br/>
And from what I’ve seen, there was a Scythe, and a Katana.<br/>
The wall guy just had a strange power, and he shouldn’t be a legendary weapon holder.<br/>
"First, there’s the Heroes of the Katana and Scythe. There was also the Harpoon, and Instrument, and the ship." (Itsuki)<br/>
"A Harpoon, an Instrument, and a Ship." (Naofumi)<br/>
They’re all quite strange weapons.<br/>
What the hell’s with the Instrument? I can’t imagine what sort of attack’s supposed to come out of it.<br/>
But there’s one even stranger than that mixed in.<br/>
"What’s with that last one. The Ship." (Naofumi)<br/>
"It had an ability much like the carriage Fitoria-san holds. It flew in the sky, and rained down attacks on us." (Itsuki)<br/>
"I didn’t see it on the battlefield I appeared on." (Naofumi)<br/>
"It was fighting with Glass-san and Wyndia-san in a different squadron." (Itsuki)<br/>
I did hear from Gaelion. Fitoria was supposed to be there as well.<br/>
Just how much of an all-out-war is this?<br/>
What’s more, they’ve enclosed in on Melromark, and the defense of the other countries is in shambles.<br/>
There are also many countries that have fallen, it seems.<br/>
Right now, a safe country… doesn’t exist.<br/>
For the time being, the world’s allied army is still fighting as one, but I can’t foresee how that will work out in the future.<br/>
"So we should be wary of them?" (Naofumi)<br/>
"Yes, right now, those five seem to be the enemy’s aces. But if you count the other reincarnators, the amount increases." (Itsuki)<br/>
"There was also a person who nullified Itsuki-sama’s Down Magic through strange ability. When the Kin tried to use Naofumi-san’s Support Magic to try to increase our abilities, the result was the same…" (Rishia)<br/>
It’s an iron rule of support, that when the other side uses it, your irritation increases proportional to their stats.<br/>
That Bitch Goddess seems to make up for the lack of coordination in her own troops through Support Magic, though.<br/>
Even though the enemy is playing on hacks, we’re using proper procedure and… Yeah, if it went like that, it’s clear why we have more losses than wins.<br/>
What’s more, she revives those involved with our side, and controls them. This is no joke.<br/>
But… I’m not going to let her do that anymore.<br/>
However… just what is Raphtalia doing?<br/>
She just went to go get Motoyasu, so isn’t she taking way too much time?<br/>
Is what I think, but the place Motoyasu was in was a troublesome parallel time-space loop, so perhaps it can’t be helped.<br/>
"Naofumi-sama." (Atlas)<br/>
"Hmm?" (Naofumi)<br/>
Atlas lightly floats to my ear, and whispers a plan.<br/>
Fumu… that sounds interesting.<br/>
"Female Knight." (Naofumi)<br/>
"… Yes, what?" (Female Knight)<br/>
When I called her Female Knight, she gave an expression that showed she had given up in the deepest depths of her heart. She let out a sigh before answering.<br/>
"Do you want to become a vassal Hero?" (Naofumi)<br/>
"What are you saying all of a sudden!? Could it be that one of the four legendary Heroes plans to steal a weapon from another Hero?" (Female Knight)<br/>
"Naofumi… I don’t know who you plan on taking it from, but please stop. Everyone’s working hard." (Ren)<br/>
"Don’t misunderstand, I just wanted to try asking is all." (Naofumi)<br/>
Well, I guess that’s the thought that would surface first.<br/>
But what I’m trying to do is nothing like that.<br/>
"I just wanted to ask those that distinguished themselves… you know." (Naofumi)<br/>
No, perhaps I should act oblivious.<br/>
I don’t plan on letting the chance slip by, though.<br/>
"I’m not sure if it’s possible or not, so don’t expect too much." (Naofumi)<br/>
"I don’t know what you plan on doing, but can’t you share it?" (Ren)<br/>
"That is…"<br/>
Atlas whispers into Ren’s and the others’ ears too.<br/>
I don’t know if I can do it, so this talk is nothing more than a good luck charm.<br/>
Though it seems Atlas is sure of herself.<br/>
"You can do something like that?" (Glass)<br/>
Glass leaned her body forward, and asked.<br/>
"It’s only a possibility, but if it worked, wouldn’t it help our situation?" (Naofumi)<br/>
"Can I… get my hopes up?" (Glass)<br/>
"Please don’t hope too much. I’m only on the level of, ‘It would be nice if that was possible.’" (Naofumi)<br/>
"Understood." (Glass)<br/>
I mean there’s no demerit to having more people.<br/>
Well, I’m leaving the larger-scale plan to Trash.<br/>
Come to think of it… there was something I was curious about.<br/>
"Glass, you use Spirit Water to recover your strength, right? Are you still able to do that?" (Naofumi)<br/>
"Yes, Itsuki offered to give some to me." (Glass)<br/>
"We were able to overcome crises many times because of her." (Itsuki)<br/>
"That should be my line." (Glass)<br/>
"Naofumi-san, would you like to hear about Glass-san’s forces? I think the information may prove useful." (Itsuki)<br/>
"Glass’s forces. You mean her allies that acted with her when she was outside of her world?" (Naofumi)<br/>
"Yes, before the World Assimilation… my comrades that were quite active in my world." (Glass)<br/>
"One of them was a Person of Soul we almost mistook for that person. You know, the one who’s part of this country’s security. She ended her sentences with…" (Rishia)<br/>
And so we shared information to some extent.<br/>
After that, I left the castle, and started walking down the dark streets.<br/>
The light was still burning in the Weapon Shop..<br/>
It was already quite late at night.<br/>
I could hear the sound of a Hammer hitting metal from the back of the shop.<br/>
"Oy." (Naofumi)<br/>
"We’ll be intruding on you." (Atlas)<br/>
We knock on the door to announce our presence.<br/>
"What. The shop’s closed you know… if it isn’t the young lad!"<br/>
For some reason, Imya and her uncle were with him.<br/>
Because of the constant battle, they’ve been making armor and weapons without stop, I’ve heard.<br/>
"Did you hear about what happened on the battlefield?" (Naofumi)<br/>
"Yeah. I was told you may be a fake, so I should wait for them to determine it at the castle, but from how it looks, there was no problem with that." (Old Man)<br/>
"I’m sick of everybody doubting me like that, though." (Naofumi)<br/>
"Haha, that behavior fits you, boy." (Old Man)<br/>
Well… being doubted makes me remember the time I came to this world…<br/>
But if someone asked if such things fit me, I’d like to shake my head.<br/>
This all happened because Witch framed me, and if that never happened, perhaps I would have lived normally.<br/>
Well, that’s fine.<br/>
"And? How are things on your end? Imya seems to be there too." (Naofumi)<br/>
"The village is still safe, but they’re making armor for those participating in the war." (Old Man)<br/>
The Old Man and Imya’s Uncle are known craftsmen. I guess requests keep coming.<br/>
And the reason Imya and her uncle are here probably has something to do with materials and equipment.<br/>
Right now, they’re not making things for the village, but for the world.<br/>
I’ve heard that the Castle Town’s largest manufacturing workshop keeps going, making weapons day and night. Here.<br/>
The weapons they make go the heroes and those close to them with the highest priority, but they’re also distributed to the lower level soldiers as well.<br/>
Come to think about it, Itsuki, Female Knight and Sadina seemed to have some high-class equipment.<br/>
They even use their free time to develop new sorts of equipment.<br/>
"And to aid your work, I brought a few books from my world." (Naofumi)<br/>
I showed the weapon books from my world to the Old Man.<br/>
Truthfully, over that long journey, they got to the brink of falling apart, but before I got to this world, I used a bit of power to restore them.<br/>
"He~! So this is a book of your world’s weapons, boy. There are quite a few here." (Old Man)<br/>
He can’t read the lettering, so I collected books that mainly focused on pictures.<br/>
They’re mainly books on the manufacturing of guns, though.<br/>
Of course, there are also a few with words tightly packed together explaining just what sort of weapons they were.<br/>
If we had time, I would help explain it in detail, but tomorrow I have to head to battle.<br/>
"In my world, there’s a process where you use charcoal to refine and harden things. So I think this may prove a little useful." (Naofumi)<br/>
"Thanks, laddy. I’ll use it with care." (Old Man)<br/>
"Making things harder with carbon… can it be applied to clothing too?" (Imya)<br/>
For some reason, Imya’s eyes are shimmering.<br/>
It seems she’s anxious to eat her way through the books.<br/>
"If I don’t teach it, it’ll probably be difficult. Just slowly analyze those books, and use them to make this shop flourish. That’s enough." (Atlas)<br/>
On Atlas’s words, I also nod.<br/>
That’s right. As long as there’s war, his business will be booming.<br/>
But I think that the Old Man is one who wishes for a world at peace.<br/>
Because he’s been lending me power since the time my life was thrown apart, I can understand.<br/>
"Leave it to me, boy, and tiger girl. By the way, where’s the young miss?" (Old Man)<br/>
"Raphtalia is working on another mission. She’s bringing Motoyasu." (Naofumi)<br/>
"Ah, the Hero of the Spear, is it? I saw him a while ago, but she’ll have it rough." (Old Man)<br/>
Rough referring to interacting with Motoyasu.<br/>
I’m of the same opinion.<br/>
So the Old Man’s seen that Motoyasu to.<br/>
To put it bluntly, no matter who looks at him, they’ll find him strange.<br/>
… No, I don’t really care about Motoyasu.<br/>
"Make sure you don’t work too hard and collapse." (Naofumi)<br/>
Well, I think this tough battle will end tomorrow.<br/>
Of course, the enemy’s situation, and Raphtalia’s arrival could delay it.<br/>
But we survived up ‘til today. I’d hate it if they died from overwork.<br/>
"I know. Hey, all of you too." (Old Man)<br/>
"Y-yes!" (Imya)<br/>
"Yes." (Imya’s Uncle)<br/>
"Ah, I see you guys are caught up in the books the young lad brought. Let me have at them too!" (Old Man)<br/>
And off they go. The three indulged in the books I brought, as they began debating things with one another.<br/>
If they collapse because of this, does it become my fault?<br/>
I’m a little worried, so I cast some fatigue recovery magic.<br/>
And after giving them a few warnings, we returned to the castle.<br/>
When I returned, at the castle gate, Firo and Melty were asleep. Perhaps they were waiting for me.<br/>
Melty had drifted to sleep while sitting atop Firo.<br/>
And Firo, as she was, slept with Melty on her back.<br/>
They must be tired.<br/>
They were quite peaceful, so I ordered a soldier to fetch me a blanket, and after draping it over them, I laid down to take a nap nearby.<br/>
Everyone’s quite busy.<br/>
But this battle will soon come to an end.<br/>
I should find some peace of mind, and sleep for a while.<br/>
At that time, Atlas murmured, "It’s the first time that Naofumi-sama agreed to let me sleep by his side", but that doesn’t really matter.<br/>
Like that, the night before the battle passed by.<br/>
