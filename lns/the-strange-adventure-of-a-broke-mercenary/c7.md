<br/>
It was most likely a trap.<br/>
That was the thought that kept going through his head.<br/>
Although goblins had low intelligence, it was hard to believe they were stupid enough to not post anyone to keep watch at the entrance.<br/>
Even mindless beasts, if they lived in packs, would make sure that some of them were guarding the entrance to their nests.<br/>
But there were no signs of any goblins keeping watch.<br/>
“Lucky that there isn’t anyone on watch. They must have been so scared they forgot to.”<br/>
Loren started shutting out Sarfe.<br/>
If he didn’t, he knew his mind wouldn’t last until the quest was over.<br/>
But still, their conversation managed to reach his ears as static.<br/>
“The trail of blood is still here so they must have gone this way.”<br/>
“In the end they’re just goblins. They were so hurt they didn’t even think about setting watch.”<br/>
“What’s your take on this Loren?<br/>
Lapis asked Loren and looked up at him, quite interested in Loren’s opinion. He was about to keep silent but then reconsidered, thinking that maybe talking to her will keep his mind off Sarfe and the others.<br/>
“It’s a trap for sure. No guards mean they’re ready to ambush us.”<br/>
“Goblins have that kind of knowledge?”<br/>
“Not sure. I don’t know much about goblins. But I do know that even monkeys set up watches. I don’t think goblins would do less than monkeys.”<br/>
“The difference in intelligence between goblins and monkeys. That’s kind of interesting.”<br/>
Lapis put her hand on her chin started speculating with a serious look on her face. Loren looked at her and felt a different kind of disbelief than with Sarfe and the others.<br/>
Since she was a follower of the god of knowledge, Loren thought that her way of thinking couldn’t be helped, but still, there was a time and place for that, and right now was definitely not the time and place.<br/>
“Are you saying that you think goblins are more intelligent than monkeys?”<br/>
“Well, of course they are.”<br/>
Although he thought of it as a problem, he diligently answered her because it helped keep his mind off his problems.<br/>
“Of course, huh. I don’t think so. Monkeys live in societies, they use tools, and they learn. How different can they be from humans?”<br/>
Loren couldn’t find anything to say and continued to chase after Sarfe and the others.<br/>
He didn’t have a logical answer like she had just now.<br/>
He thought that goblins were smarter than monkeys because he felt that they were. He had no clear evidence.<br/>
But if he said that out loud, it would sound like he was saying that there isn’t much of a difference between humans, monkeys, and goblins.<br/>
“I guess it just means we shouldn’t underestimate them?”<br/>
Not being able to come up with a good argument, he concluded that Lapis may be right, and muttered under his breath.<br/>
Lapis heard him and nodded, looking straight at his face.<br/>
Meanwhile, Sarfe and the others were pulling further and further ahead.<br/>
Since the only source of light was Oxy’s magic, Loren made sure not to lose sight of them.<br/>
He couldn’t help but worry that they were being too careless going this fast.<br/>
Loren was about to make a point when Sarfe suddenly stopped.<br/>
The path was slightly curved, and Loren couldn’t see what the three in front were seeing.<br/>
As Loren started to suspect that something happened, Sarfe spoke up.<br/>
“There’s a chamber up ahead, and there’s light pouring out of it.”<br/>
If that were true, it meant whatever is inside there could see Oxy’s light as well, and there was no point in stopping here. However, Loren decided not to interrupt Sarfe.<br/>
“An ambush?”<br/>
“Kind of sucks that they have bows.”<br/>
Naron and Oxy started a carefree conversation.<br/>
Sarfe, who finally made up his mind, faced them and told them his decision.<br/>
“I’ll charge in first and block the arrows. You guys follow me up.”<br/>
“You’ve got guts to run face first into an ambush with arrows ready for you.”<br/>
Thought Loren, looking at Sarfe with pure amazement.<br/>
Even though the enemy were goblins, Loren thought that running into archers in this narrow cave with no space to dodge the arrows was suicide.<br/>
“Do you need the magic <<Protection>> ?”<br/>
Sarfe nodded when Oxy asked him, and she closed her eyes and proceeded to cast the spell.<br/>
Loren found nothing to say, seeing that she was using one of her three spell usages on such a thoughtless charge. He felt Lapis tug at his sleeve.<br/>
“You seem dissatisfied.”<br/>
Not wanting to show his true thoughts, he averted his eyes and answered her, who asked him in a teasing manner.<br/>
“Hmm, not sure.”<br/>
“If you were in charge, how would you handle this situation?”<br/>
Loren wasn’t sure why she wanted to know, but answered her, thinking of it as a change of pace.<br/>
“I’d pile raw wood in front of the cave and set in on fire.”<br/>
Loren believed that it was the simplest yet most certain mean of attacking enemies within a sealed space such as a cave.<br/>
He wasn’t sure how large the cave system was, but the smoke and heat would eventually fill up inside. After that, most creatures inside would be dead soon enough.<br/>
“We’d need oil for that.”<br/>
It’s not easy to burn raw wood.<br/>
To do what Loren was thinking of, they would either need lots of oil or dry wood.<br/>
“I don’t have a flint or any oil so I would give up and leave.”<br/>
Loren answered Lapis, realizing how sad it was to not have any money to buy supplies.<br/>
“I see.”<br/>
Lapis looked convinced and didn’t say anything more. Instead, Sarfe called him.<br/>
“I’m going to have you come with me.”<br/>
“Do I not get any protective spells?”<br/>
“You have a big sword, so just use that as a shield.”<br/>
Oxy said loudly with a frown on her face and Naron nodded her head, agreeing with what she said.<br/>
“Sorry, but we can’t spare another spell for defense. Instead I’ll make sure to cover you.”<br/>
“Alright then. Unfortunate for me, though.”<br/>
What Loren had in his hand right now was the small sword one of the goblins used.<br/>
Trying to deflect arrows with it was going to be very unreliable, and using his great sword as a shield would hinder his movements because of its massive size and weight.<br/>
The thought that this wasn’t the first time a helpless leader had given bad orders gave him a little bit of comfort. Loren gripped the sword tightly, and Sarfe took it that he was ready and shouted.<br/>
“Alright, let’s go!”<br/>
Loren followed him, not amused by the fact that the enemy must have heard him from a mile away.<br/>
It was pretty much telling the goblins that they were going towards them. Soon enough, arrows started raining down on them.<br/>
Sarfe, who was in front, tried to parry them but failed.<br/>
But the protection magic reduced the speed of the arrows, and none of them were able pierce <br/>
Sarfe’s leather armor and dropped onto the floor.<br/>
Loren was quite impressed by the magic and how useful it was while striking down an arrow that got past Sarfe.<br/>
“Damn, this is so dull.”<br/>
The sword broke the arrow rather than cut through it, and the pieces dropped on the ground.<br/>
He didn’t have time to be complaining about the sharpness and was about to jump into the clearing where the goblins were waiting. <br/>
Loren suddenly stopped in his tracks, while Sarfe suddenly fell down and rolled right into the awaiting goblins.<br/>
“Sarfe!”<br/>
Naron, who was right behind Sarfe, rushed into the area followed by Oxy and Lapis.<br/>
“Hey, wait!”<br/>
As the three of them rushed past him, he was barely able to get a hold of Lapis’ collar and stopped her.<br/>
Lapis let out a slight moan, but seeing Oxy sprawl onto the ground as well, she realized why Loren stopped her.<br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
“A trap!?”<br/>
“There’s a smart one in there somewhere!”<br/>
There was a small dent in the floor that could barely fit a foot, well camouflaged in the rough ground.<br/>
It was a simple trap, done by digging a small hole in the ground, but unfortunately Sarfe and Oxy didn’t notice it and got caught on it.<br/>
“Sarfe! Get up!”<br/>
There was no way the goblins would ignore such a defenseless opponent.<br/>
Another barrage of arrows rained down. <br/>
Although Naron deflected some of them, the rest got through and lodged into Sarfe’s right shoulder and left thigh, as well as in Naron’s right flank.<br/>
“Damn it! How dare you!”<br/>
Oxy cursed and got ready to use a spell. Loren ignored her and scanned his eyes through the goblin ranks.<br/>
Around ten archers.<br/>
Many with small swords and clubs.<br/>
In the deepest part he saw one that was a whole size larger, holding a staff made from animal bones, and wearing a golden necklace with a strange light emitting from it.<br/>
“Is that the head?”<br/>
Based on the way it was dressed and its size, Loren guessed that it was.<br/>
Still held by her collar, Lapis muttered<br/>
“Is that…a goblin mage?”<br/>
“A high rank monster. This is bad.”<br/>
For goblins that had a high reproduction rate and expanded quickly, it was possible for a special one to be born.<br/>
Or it could’ve been born as a regular goblin, but through experience, change into something different.<br/>
Those individuals were called high rank monsters and were known to be a few times more dangerous than normal goblins. Packs led by the high rank often became more dangerous as well.<br/>
Goblin mages were rare even among the high ranks, as it meant that a goblin somehow gained magical knowledge, making it one of the most dangerous among them.<br/>
Going against them without any preparation meant only disasters were waiting.<br/>
Loren decided that they should retreat, but Sarfe and Naron, who were closest to the goblins, were under attack by arrows, and Oxy was already chanting a spell.<br/>
“Damn it…”<br/>
Although he knew that giving a warning and helping the others was what he should do, he concluded that it was impossible to save all of them. He looked back at the path that they came from, but what he saw left him speechless.<br/>
“We got flanked!?”<br/>
He thought that it was a straight path to this area, but maybe because of the dim light or maybe because Loren didn’t pay close enough attention, the path they came from was filled with goblins with a few larger ones behind it, all of them rushing towards the area where Loren and the others were in.<br/>

Hey guys Kaoto here!<br/>
As you guys can see, Sarfe and his group’s stupidity reached its peak…<br/>
Other than that, not much else to talk about for this chapter.<br/>
For those of you who wanted Sarfe and friends to have a miserable end, it may just happen in the next chapter. Have your fingers crossed and keep tight 🙂<br/>
Ill try to have the next one out as soon as I can, and I’ll see you guys in the next chapter!<br/>
Oh…and I think that Slime possibly could have asked some of you guys for help, saying that it’s getting abused and stuff. Please disregard everything that you may have heard because it’s not true. I don’t mistreat it and I can even go to say that I take care of it really well. It just doesn’t know how to be thankful for what I do for it every day 😦<br/>
