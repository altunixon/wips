Arifureta After III   Abyss Lord Arc Chapter 2   Aby Through The Looking Glass<br/>
<br/>
AN: ↑ Subtitle. From the review of the previous chapter, it hit the spot for Shirakome, so I used it.<br/>
You who wrote the review, thank you very much!<br/>
Thank you very much for the other readers too who are always writing fun reviews!<br/>
<br/>
Bloody wind was blowing violently, cracks ran through the ground, and there were countless mountains of rubble and craters.<br/>
Black clouds covered the sky, and hellfire could be seen running between the clouds. It was like magma overflowing from crevices on the ground. Thunder was constantly roaring, and the world was being dyed with the redness of blood and flame.<br/>
"The world on the other side of the glass"――the other side of the unknown large mirror hidden underground in the Vatican was truly a place that was worthy of being called as "hell".<br/>
「Tsu!? ――My clone!?」<br/>
The one who slipped out the shocked voice was Kousuke who rushed into hell to answer the voice of a young man who was seeking salvation.<br/>
The moment he passed through the glass, his link with the clone at the Grant house was severed. At the same time, his senses were telling him that he could summon clones up to his maximum number. His clone was dispelled unintentionally.<br/>
「As I thought, the world is different……」<br/>
No matter how excellent Kousuke’s clone was, it couldn’t be continuously maintained when he crossed over worlds. Even though the clone was able to move independently, its source of power was the magic power of the main body. As expected, when the connection was severed by the interval of worlds the clone became impossible to maintain.<br/>
An ashamed feeling crossed the corner of his mind that surely he made Emily and others worried with this, but the strange and supernatural pressing situation before his eyes didn’t allow for unnecessary thoughts.<br/>
Countless shadows were squirming inside the bloody wind that became even more terrible, like a thick sandstorm.<br/>
「Shit-. How troublesome……」<br/>
He unconsciously let out a curse.<br/>
Whether it was the condition, the environment, or the situation, everything was the worst.<br/>
It appeared that the blood wind had quite that bad effect on the human body. Since the moment he stepped in here, Kousuke was feeling it――the pain as though his lungs were being stabbed, his prickling skin as though he was burning, stamina and vitality, and his spirit, the energies for the sake of living felt like they were slipping out from the core of his body.<br/>
This world wasn’t kind at all to a living person.<br/>
In addition, due to the bloody wind that was increasing in thickness and intensity, he lost sight of the strangely shaped humanoid and his rescue target.<br/>
Kousuke’s Presence Detection normally had a range around 150 meters in diameter. If it was a presence that he had memorized, it was possible to continue to sense the presence within 300 meters at maximum, but he couldn’t detect his target’s presence within his range.<br/>
In exchange, the presence of a great number of "something" where it seemed stupid trying to count them was astir.<br/>
Anyway, he at least understood the direction to a certain degree. He had to advance toward that direction, catch the presence of the woman within his range once more, rescue her, and then escape.<br/>
(The time limit is……ten minutes I guess.)<br/>
He pushed up his sunglasses, readjusted the position of the mask that was covering the lower portion of his face up to his nose, and muttered inside his heart a time limit over himself.<br/>
Instantly, repulsive voices resounded directly inside his brain.<br/>
――Human-! Human-!<br/>
――There is a human-! Living, human-!<br/>
――Feed-, feed-<br/>
「These things talk-!? Or rather, they noticed me!?」<br/>
To even say he was thunderstruck was not enough to express how shocked he was. In addition, he wasn’t happy at all even though he had been noticed. Rather, he got goosebumps, and it felt like there was a block of ice sliding down his spine.<br/>
But, there was no free time to stiffen from the indescribable repulsiveness. The many "something" mixed inside the surrounding bloody wind attacked.<br/>
Their speed was similar to a wild cheetah assaulting their prey with its top speed. In addition, their tricky movements that made use of the surrounding rubble and craters was like a monkey freely going through a sea of trees as they pleased.<br/>
The bizarre movement and abnormal speed made it next to impossible to deal with them on the first encounter. A normal human would surely be done in by the first move.<br/>
「I’ve got no time to care of this!」<br/>
*Hyun*, the streak of a sword flash ran through the bloody wind. Right after that, Kousuke’s figure appeared a few meters ahead. His pose with one hand pushing up his sunglasses while staying unmoving was truly striking. Even though he still hadn’t fully entered the Abyss Lord mode.<br/>
The result was naturally……<br/>
All of the attacking "somethings" ――bloodshot dark red eyes, hair, and teeth that grew sparsely, bizarrely long limbs, a thin and ashen body that had a deficit here and there, and yet only their stomach was strangely bloating up――had their heads tumbling to the ground without a single exception. It was as though they were monsters like ghouls.<br/>
And then, they got up as if nothing happened.<br/>
「No way!?」<br/>
Kousuke-san who entered Abyss Lord mode briefly reflexively returned to normal.<br/>
The ghoul-like things that he had definitely beheaded were regenerating their heads as the cut section began bubbling and swelling up. Their tumbling heads started withering rapidly and were blown away by the bloody wind.<br/>
Even during that time, the ghoul-like things attacked him one after another.<br/>
「Chih. Even though I don’t have time, it’s rea~lly troublesome!」<br/>
He then unsheathed his second short sword.<br/>
He dodged the incoming hands and beheaded them while passing through.<br/>
He trampled those that came crawling toward him, used those who came leaping at him as footstools and jumped further. The kunai that he let flew using a Telepathy Stone skewering five of the things altogether.<br/>
With a rotation in midair, he mowed down the ghoul-like things that jumped at him and crushed the enemy underfoot with his feet when he landed.<br/>
And then, all those enemies regenerated and got up as though nothing happened.<br/>
「They’re immortal!? There is no end to it!」<br/>
They came from all directions. The rain of ghoul-like things that leapt out from the bloody wind even caused the sky to become temporarily not visible.<br/>
「Can’t be helped-, ――"Black Vortex"!」<br/>
Gravity magic "Black Vortex" ――a magic that deployed a gravity field in the selected direction.<br/>
Kousuke made himself freefall toward the sky and forcefully blew away the swarm of ghoul-like things falling from over his head, opening a path to break through.<br/>
And then, below, the ghoul-like things which were reaching out their hands to Kousuke were piling up to form a small mountain. He got goosebumps seeing that sight while deploying a gravity field in the horizontal direction. He began freefalling toward the direction of his target.<br/>
「Guuh, it’s harsh as expected-. Yue-san is seriously a monster.」<br/>
The body was burdened because it radically changed directions from freefalling to above toward a horizontal direction, and also due to the enormous amount of magic power consumption from using gravity magic continuously. Kousuke raised an anguished voice.<br/>
In actuality, the gravity magic that Kousuke could use in battle was extremely limited. The change of gravity’s direction to stand on the ceiling or a wall, the conferment of a gravity field, increase and decrease of gravity with him at the center――he could do things at that level.<br/>
If he wanted to do things like Yue, compressing the enemy to death instantly, swallowing all enemy attacks and compressing them while making a gravity sphere in return, mixing elemental magic with gravity magic, and so on, he had to spend much time on it. He also couldn’t use them consecutively.<br/>
Yue could activate something like basic gravity magic "Black Vortex" as easily as breathing without any incantation and did pseudo-flight freely with it. She made it look simple, but in actuality, even that was only possible with a super advanced skill of simultaneously controlling multiple gravity magic from speed adjustment to direction adjustment and even continuous neutralization of the normal gravity.<br/>
The same could be said as how Hajime and Shia had no magic talent and were unable to use gravity magic properly.<br/>
Although Kousuke possessed some talent, he was originally a frontliner; in addition, he couldn’t manipulate magic power directly, and to add further, he didn’t even possess an abnormal amount of magic power. For him, the age of god magic called gravity magic was his trump card, but at the same time, it was also a magic that was too advanced with a bad usability for him.<br/>
Also, Kousuke’s flight time was only around thirty seconds though it would be a different story if he was in a Limit Break state or in the deepest state of Abyss Lord mode.<br/>
Once more he grumbled that the bride of the monster of the abyss was a monster as expected!, which he wouldn’t be able to say face to face, even while continuously activating gravity magic desperately. However, he finally detected the presence he was expectantly looking for as compensation for consuming magic power like crazy.<br/>
His remaining flight time was about ten-odd seconds, but his speed was that of someone freefalling. It was more than enough to close the distance of a few hundred meters.<br/>
Kousuke held his breath and shifted his mask in order to drink some recovery medicine during that time to recover from his body’s damage and magic power. And then, he took out a recovery medicine from the Treasure Warehouse and moved to drink it……<br/>
Just before he could,<br/>
――iaAAAAAAAH<br/>
There was a repulsive shriek piercing his ears.<br/>
「Kuh!?」<br/>
Kousuke instantly stopped the "Black Vortex" and shifted his trajectory by falling normally. Instantly, very bizarre creatures passed through in grazing distance of him.<br/>
They were ghoul-like things with wings of a thin membrane that looked transparent. Other than wings, they contained traits such as sharp fangs and extremely irregular heads that allowed their brain to be exposed, bringing about an unimaginable ugliness.<br/>
「What is it this time!?」<br/>
Kousuke raised his voice with irritation mixed in because he dropped the medicine when the impact from the graze in passing, and because he breathed in the bloody wind without the mask.<br/>
He returned his mask’s position to normal, and at the same time he used the technique "Wood Splinter Dance" ――the derivation skill of "Shadow Dance" to leap using dust and dirt midair as instantaneous footholds――to leap and avoid the "thing" that flew toward him from another direction.<br/>
But, even here the problem was the pure number of the enemies as expected.<br/>
The winged ghoul-like things that rushed at him from all directions while letting out shrieks that disturbed the mind were rapidly approaching one after another in trajectories that totally ignored aerodynamics. Finally, one of them succeeded in tackling Kousuke.<br/>
「Woaahh!?」<br/>
――Living-, human!<br/>
Kousuke got cold sweat seeing the jaw that snapped close *gakin-* before his eyes. Of course, he didn’t commit the blunder of being hit directly and firmly guarded using his short sword. Although no matter what, he was at a disadvantage midair.<br/>
He was pushed by the momentum of the enemy’s rush, and they plunged through the storm of bloody wind like that. From behind, a new player came rushing in for a pincer attack!<br/>
Kousuke’s eyes slowly narrowed.<br/>
「――Can you all, stop already!? ――"Gouka Beni SenpuuWhirling Dark Flame of the Abyss"」 (TN: Hell Fire Crimson Whirlwind)<br/>
――Abyss-style KatonFire Ninja Art – FutonWind Ninja Art Combination Skill   Gouka Beni SenpuuWhirling Dark Flame of the Abyss<br/>
A vortex of flames swallowed the surrounding while spreading to the sky and earth. It was defensive magic in all directions that created a tornado of flame that was whirling with the caster at the center.<br/>
The ghoul-like thing that was biting on the short sword, the one who attempted a pincer attack from behind, and not just them, but even the things below and above that were looking for a chance to attack were also dragged into the magic flame tornado altogether.<br/>
And then, *PAN* after the sound of wind bursting accompanied the disappearance of the flame tornado, the person who was pushing up his sunglasses meaninglessly……<br/>
That was, Kousuke……<br/>
No, starting from the irritation that the situation wouldn’t progress smoothly, his binding of the heart finally came off――it was the Abyss LordAbyssgate!<br/>
「Hou. It appears their regeneration is faltering before my abyssal skill, isn’t it?」<br/>
Lord Abyssgate was staying in midair with the power of the Air Force boots while narrowing his eyes behind his sunglasses in a striking pose.<br/>
Just as he said, the winged ghoul-like things which got hit by "Gouka Beni Senpuu" were turned into dust and carried by the wind without being able to regenerate.<br/>
Were they weak against flames? Or perhaps because it was an attack by magic? If it was the latter, then would physical attacks be effective as long as he coated them with magic power?<br/>
Although, the time to verify that was scarce.<br/>
Inside the thick encirclement of the winged ghoul-like things surrounding him in a spherical shape, the lord made a fearless grin and readied his short swords in a cross shape.<br/>
There was no particular meaning in that!<br/>
「If you think you can stop this me, the noble of the abyss, then feel free to try! The dead of the hell!」<br/>
It was unknown when he became a noble! But, he was always introducing himself as a lord, so let’s not pick at minor details!<br/>
The lord bent his knee in midair like a tightened coil, and then in the next instant, he leapt out like a cannon shell. At the same time, he activated the gravity magic "Black Vortex" once more.<br/>
He barrel rolled his body while cutting apart the winged ghoul-like things that came from the front.<br/>
Following the orbit of his slash, the two short swords carved an afterimage of a shining red cross in midair.<br/>
The short swords that were originally jet black were containing a radiant light right now.<br/>
――Short Sword   Brilliant Lightning and Flame Sword of Ruin<br/>
It was an artifact that performed "pseudo light sabe○ transformation" by compressing advanced flame elemental magic to coat the sword.<br/>
Magic + a blade of super high heat that melted everything. It was unclear which one of them was effective, but as expected, the winged ghoul-like thing that was slashed withered and vanished without regenerating.<br/>
The lord sneered 「Fuh」 toward the things that rushed at such lord only with numbers to back them up.<br/>
The winged ghoul-like things came attacking from left and right.<br/>
「Where are you looking?」<br/>
「Above you is empty, you know?」<br/>
There were two black silhouettes that were falling from above. At the same time as the heads of the two winged ghoul-like things were sliced, their bodies were falling in a tailspin.<br/>
A newcomer reached out its long hand from the front.<br/>
「Who do you think you are standing against?」<br/>
It was pierced from right below and vanished while being blown away. The third black silhouette twirled in midair and took a position.<br/>
The three silhouettes――the three clones――surrounded the main body of the lord from the left, the right, and in front in a delta formation.<br/>
Although the enemies were pushing using their numbers, the three clones attacked with the resolve of taking down the enemies with them. When any of them vanished, a new clone would appear from the outset and unleash a one-hit kill.<br/>
The winged ghoul-like things had no way to stop the advance that was like a surging wave. The lord finally broke through the encirclement.<br/>
「Muh, out already!」<br/>
At the same time, it seemed like that also meant breaking through the very thick storm of bloody wind.<br/>
*Bobah* The lord slipped through the storm of bloody wind with such sound and got out to the other side. However, he was unusually at a loss of words and went into a daze.<br/>
「What is……this place?」<br/>
Black clouds covered the cracked sky. Although the density was lower, the bloody wind that was blowing violently, along with the dried and cracked ground, hadn’t changed at all.<br/>
But, there was something that made the lord gaze in wonderment.<br/>
「A, city? This place」<br/>
Yes, what was reflected in the lord’s eyes was a devastated city’s townscape.<br/>
There were numerous half-destroyed buildings that gave the impression of a skyscraper. Roads that were bulging, or gouged, littered the ground. There were also sections that were turned into mountains of rubble, and a large hole that reminded anyone watching of hell.<br/>
Far away at the other side of the spreading devastated city, were mountains glowing red with flowing magma. A gigantic lake that seemed to be made from the magma could be seen too. The expression of "a kettle of hell" was truly fitting for it.<br/>
The saying of the world of the end undoubtedly referred to this.<br/>
The lord thought that without any particular reason.<br/>
――IIIIIIIII<br/>
――HUMAaaAAAAAAN<br/>
The lord brought down the winged ghoul-like things leaping out from inside the storm of bloody wind behind him while scolding himself for stupidly getting dumbfounded like this.<br/>
He concentrated and searched for the location of the presence he detected in more detail.<br/>
And then,<br/>
「――Found you.」<br/>
The lord became a streak of shadow and rushed through the air.<br/>
–<br/>
–<br/>
–<br/>
A voice could be heard.<br/>
A repulsive voice that disturbed the heart.<br/>
The voice of the arch-enemy that she had heard for thousands, tens of thousands of times.<br/>
The heat of hell and the slimy shadow caressed her skin.<br/>
Aa, it was the usual dream again……<br/>
Claudia thought so, but she wondered why.<br/>
Even though it should be a dream, it felt more real than usual.<br/>
She wondered if that demon that continued to remain clinging inside her brain was something that granted pain and suffering that was this raw.<br/>
――The time, came<br/>
She wondered why.<br/>
Its words were different from usual. "That guy" would first sneer, and then said it. "If the time come". Like that, it would then continue to say "I’ll violate, lodge inside you, and go to the boundary of interval".<br/>
‘Aa, I see’. Claudia understood inside her hazy consciousness.<br/>
The time had come. The reason why "the guy" who took away both her parents let only herself escaped. It was the time, to carry it out.<br/>
It was time, the most terrifying time!<br/>
「Uh, a?」<br/>
Buzzing and thunderous wind hit her ears. The wind that caressed her skin was accompanied by discomfort and agony, and the dull pain in her solar plexus was gradually awakening her consciousness.<br/>
Claudia groaned while slowly opening her eyes. She was in a state where her consciousness was still half in the dream world, but the discomfort and agony, and the intense out of place feeling that gave her the sense of weightlessness was pushing her consciousness rapidly to the surface.<br/>
「――kuh」<br/>
Her consciousness that became clear made her notice the thing coiling around her torso. That sensation, that presence that made her feel sick in a display of her soul’s rejection of that thing that was just too repulsive.<br/>
"The time, came."<br/>
A terrifying sneering that was unthinkable to come from this world reached her ears.<br/>
It wasn’t a dream. It wasn’t a voice that could be heard from a dream. The voice definitely, reached her ears right now!<br/>
「――!?」<br/>
Claudia raised a soundless scream. Her hazy mind was noisily raising the red alert alarm sound. The warning her soul gave her was rapidly restoring her consciousness.<br/>
"The false kings have vanished, and the annoying seal was undone. My empty body, will obtain――I’ve been waiting, Claudia. The body that will give birth to me."<br/>
The sneering laugh that sounded like metal being scratched by a claw resounded once more. Just from that, it felt like a human’s heart could easily be turned mad. The laughing voice was just too blasphemous.<br/>
What entered Claudia’s sight when she lifted her gaze up was a nightmarish reality.<br/>
"Shadow". A condensed "shadow" that took on the shape of a human. Countless flames were rushing about like blood vessels, spurting out from the cracks of the "shadow". Its eyes, mouth, and nose were existences shaped by hellfire. The left arm stretching out from the thing’s body was holding Claudia’s body!<br/>
「You are-――kafuh, cough-!?」<br/>
Claudia opened her eyes wide and tried to say something, but the dull pain on her solar plexus caused her to cough.<br/>
At the same time, that dull pain shook her memory back.<br/>
「-, Aziz! Aumale!?」<br/>
She looked around while still being carried by the thing’s arm. She could only see a storm of bloody wind and desolated townscape. The people she was looking for, weren’t there.<br/>
But, the answer unexpectedly came from her arch-enemy.<br/>
"Kakaka-. If it’s that human, he already became the nourishment for my body. It was his reward for being useful."<br/>
「A, aa, such a thing……」<br/>
"That human" ――Claudia guessed that it undoubtedly referred to Aumale.<br/>
Aumale Garret. He was Claudia’s comrade and also her subordinate. And then――the "traitor" who caused the incident this time.<br/>
Claudia recalled it. Due to Aumale’s report, she hurried to the "hall of mirror gate" that connected to the foreign world together with Aziz――to "hell".<br/>
Aumale reported in a panic that the seal of the "mirror gate" was loosening and that at that rate the "gate of hell" would open.<br/>
But, what was reflected in the eyes of Claudia who arrived at that hall was the "mirror gate" with its seal in pristine condition.<br/>
When Claudia was going to ask what the meaning of that was, it was Aziz’s anguished voice which entered Claudia’s ear.<br/>
When she turned around to see what happened, she saw the figures of the two clinging onto each other as though they were embracing. It was as though, when Aziz turned around just like Claudia to ask what was going on, Aumale grappled him.<br/>
And then, her important younger step-brother fell on his knees.<br/>
They weren’t related by blood. However, since the time he was taken in when he was a child with similar circumstances as her, Aziz became her family as though he was her little brother. And that beloved little brother of hers was sinking into his own puddle of blood.<br/>
Why? Why was Aziz collapsing? Why was a knife stabbed into his stomach? Why was so much blood flowing out like that?<br/>
Claudia, who was unable to grasp the scene happening in front of her eyes immediately, screamed to call out to Aziz. Aumale smoothly approached her who was like that.<br/>
What Claudia remembered was the impact she felt right after that on her solar plexus, and how the "Heavenly Light Cross" she carried was taken and thrown away.<br/>
There, Claudia was taken aback with surprise and felt around her chest. Because she was made to abandon the "Heavenly Light Cross", she confirmed on her body thinking ‘could it be’, but……<br/>
The result that was just as expected caused blood to leave from her expression.<br/>
"Is this, what you were looking for?"<br/>
「! Return it!」<br/>
Even though Claudia understood that it was pointless, meaningless, and laughable, she couldn’t help but yell it.<br/>
Something like a tentacle that was stretching out from the shoulder of the "shadow" had an antique reddish-brown cross with a chain attached dangling from there. That was exactly the reason why Claudia’s face went pale. It was the secret treasure that only Claudia was permitted to bring. It must not be handed over to the enemy no matter what.<br/>
In front of the "shadow" who was sneering at Claudia’s agitation, she slowly closed her eyes.<br/>
She wasn’t giving up.<br/>
It was the reverse.<br/>
It was for fighting.<br/>
She had no weapon and also no comrades, but since that day, from that time when the nightmarish scene of her childhood was carved into her heart, she had determined, resolved, and prepared herself!<br/>
「――Oh Lord, please hear the prayer of Thy child. Please grant Thy compassionate and lamenting voice within mine heart. Please bestow the divine protection to Thy devout believer――」<br/>
It was the manifestation of power that could only be used by a very little amount of people even within the organization that Claudia belonged too. The exercise of a miracle by chanting a scripture.<br/>
A faint jade-colored light wrapped around Claudia and burned the arm of the "shadow" that was restraining her!<br/>
But,<br/>
"Kakaka-. Good, struggle. It’s a delicacy."<br/>
The unbothered sneering laugh and hellfire that was mixed with blackness coiled around Claudia. And then, an even more intense pressure assaulted Claudia. An unpleasant sound rang out from her ribs, and intense pain pierced through her brain.<br/>
「Kuh!? ――Oh Lord, I beg You to cut down the evil of the wicked, and help the righteous to stand firmly. The shield of God protects me. Those with a just heart is saved by God.」<br/>
But, Claudia didn’t stop praying. She wouldn’t stop just because of pain.<br/>
The gentle phosphorescence wrapping around Claudia like a firefly light was increasing in radiance, causing the arm of the "shadow" to smoke white.<br/>
In front of such Claudia, the lump of shadow was slowly……<br/>
"Claire? Why are you tormenting your mother?"<br/>
「-!?」<br/>
The prayer that caused the miracle stopped. Though she immediately restarted it.<br/>
"How horrible you are, Claire. You are still planning to torment your father?"<br/>
「Sto, stop!」<br/>
She missed those voices, and yet those voices contained a hatred that stopped her prayer for sure this time.<br/>
In front of Claudia’s eyes――were the figures of her dear mother and father. The two who had only their heads left.<br/>
She received a flashback of that day’s scene. To shake it off, Claudia tried to strengthen the power of the miracle further, but the two were looking pained in proportion with her effort.<br/>
「u, aa――」<br/>
The shadow loomed over her determination from that day.<br/>
She understood. This was an illusion. A nightmare that this foreign world and the "shadow" showed her.<br/>
She understood.<br/>
But,<br/>
"Stop it, Claireee"<br/>
"Please, don’t hurt us even more than this"<br/>
To think that her heart was this weak. Claudia harbored an emotion that resembled despair while stopping her words of prayer completely.<br/>
And then, the blazing hellfire burned Claudia’s skin as though to say that it was her punishment.<br/>
「aAAAAAAAAAAAH!?」<br/>
"The greatest flesh that will conceive my body. I won’t destroy it."<br/>
But, although it wouldn’t destroy the body, it seemed that it didn’t mean that it wouldn’t torment her. An unpleasant voice that was smeared with sadism and scorn scorched the wound.<br/>
A burn scar that was like a welt was carved on Claudia’s body like a seal. Intense pain blocked her throat. Far from praying, even her will to resist was messed up.<br/>
Small tears spilled out from Claudia’s eyes.<br/>
The tears that were immediately blown away into nothing by the bloody wind wasn’t because of the pain, but because of her mortification.<br/>
She had accumulated diligent studying for more than ten years for the sake of this day.<br/>
She repressed the negative emotion of hatred and resentment that would give strength to the "shadow" in order to fight with a heart of purity and unselfishness in order to negate the nightmarish childhood scene nesting inside her heart.<br/>
And yet, she couldn’t do anything.<br/>
Because she was betrayed by a person who she believed in. Because she witnessed her little brother being lethally wounded. Because she didn’t have any weapon in hand.<br/>
She couldn’t even make those excuses.<br/>
She believed that she could do more. With the diligent studying and experience she had accumulated, her daily prayers, and her faithful heart, she believed that she had been bestowed with the strength to overcome the "shadow".<br/>
But, this was the result.<br/>
「……O Lord-, grant me Thy hand of salvation-. Lend me Thy strength-」<br/>
"Kakaka-"<br/>
She asked for salvation to God pleadingly, but what came back was a laughing voice that fanned up disgust.<br/>
The light of salvation didn’t shine down――<br/>
(O Lord, why, won’t You answer me……)<br/>
She couldn’t hear God’s voice――<br/>
Then, at the very least,<br/>
(……Please, please)<br/>
She wanted to be punished as someone who would become a great sinner for mankind after this. She wanted to be given punishment for her sin of being unable to resist evil.<br/>
And then, she prayed for salvation even if only slightly for her comrades who were like her family who fought until the bitter end――<br/>
"……? ……Human?"<br/>
That call wasn’t directed at Claudia.<br/>
The "shadow" suddenly stopped. Even while gasping in pain, Claudia somehow lifted up her face. And then, she understood even within her hazy mind that it wasn’t her who was being addressed.<br/>
The "shadow" looked around the surrounding suspiciously.<br/>
Right after that, there were countless sounds of slicing wind!<br/>
"!?"<br/>
The "shadow" swept its arm. Following its arm’s trajectory, a whip of hellfire flew and struck down the countless things flying toward it.<br/>
One of the things stabbed ahead of the gaze of Claudia who was being held.<br/>
It was a short sword with a shape that Claudia had never seen before. A blade with an extended diamond shape, with a guardless handle attached, and at the end of the handle, it became ring-shaped. A strange shape. Even though it was jet black colored as though to absorb light, for some reason, it was shining faintly.<br/>
「This is……」<br/>
Her eyes opened wide. She understood that even though she had never seen it before. It was a short sword that was suitable to being thrown even while containing many utilities, something that shouldn’t be used by an existence of this foreign world.<br/>
Yes, it was a "weapon that human used"!<br/>
「Where do you think you are going?」<br/>
A human’s voice could be heard. A voice of a young man. It came from the other side of the bloody wind in front of them.<br/>
「I don’t know the situation, but let me say that I cannot admire this. Learn some more about the way to escort a woman.」<br/>
The "shadow" narrowed its eyes quietly.<br/>
Claudia too was directing her gaze toward the voice in surprise.<br/>
Like that, he appeared.<br/>
「Although, perhaps this warning is a bit too harsh for you whose figure is only like a shoddy portrayal……In any case, this is a request from a courageous little brother. I’ll have you return that woman.」<br/>
A man in black appeared as though melting out from inside the bloody wind.<br/>
The sunglasses and mask that was covering almost all of his lower face caused his face to be unknown. His figure walking calmly with a short sword in one hand made one apt to forget that this was a foreign world that was like hell.<br/>
She thought that her comrades came to save her, but this person’s figure didn’t exist within Claudia’s memory. He looked like a youth from the Orient who was younger than her but……<br/>
That man――was making a turn adroitly, for some reason. He pushed up his sunglasses sharply. He crossed his arms, and made a striking pose! Just why in the world!<br/>
Claudia’s brain was flooded with questions!<br/>
The "shadow" swung its hellfire whip with no questions asked. Perhaps the whip broke through sound barrier instantly because it left the bursting sound *PAN-* in its wake, arriving at its target within an instant.<br/>
Normally, the youth would be struck by the hellfire whip without even any time to blink and be burned to ash, or his body would be bisected, and his life would come to an end.<br/>
Of course, the youth――who had snapped seeing Claudia who was worn-out from torture and the sneering laugh of the "shadow" that was filled with delight which he could hear while he was approaching the two of them――the lord, easily struck back the whip with a blazing hot short sword.<br/>
The eyes of the "shadow" snapped wide open. And Claudia was also the same.<br/>
In front of such a monster from a foreign world and the woman who he ought to save, the lord grinned fearlessly――and declared.<br/>
「From here on, unreasonableness will be performed. Lament your wretched luck of being in front of the abyss and fall to ruin.」<br/>
Claudia thought.<br/>
‘Aa, my Lord, I’m grateful.<br/>
To grant salvation to this one.<br/>
But, o Lord.<br/>
Please, tell me one thing.<br/>
――Why is Your messenger, still turning and posing like that?’<br/>
<br/>
AN: Thank you very much for reading this every time.<br/>
Thank you very much too for the thoughts, opinions, and reports about misspelling and omitted words.<br/>

PS<br/>
The comic of Arifureta’s original version has been updated on Gardo.<br/>
Karm-san is seriously terrific. Also, Yue-san’s reluctant face really hit the spot.<br/>
When I read it, Yue and Shia at that time certainly felt like that huuh. It’s nostalgic.<br/>
It’s distributed freely on Overlap-sama’s homepage, so if you like, please go read it by all means.<br/>
