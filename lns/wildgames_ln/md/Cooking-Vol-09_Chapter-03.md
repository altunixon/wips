The next day, the 30th day of the Blue month.<br/>
After half a month, the second conference between the tribal chiefs of Forest’s Edge and the noble of Genos Pyschkurewuss occurred.<br/>
Not all things could be resolved today.<br/>
Or rather, this was the beginning of new troubles.<br/>
In order to correct the twisted relationship between Forest’s Edge and Genos and to uncover the schemes of Pyschkurewuss, Donda Wu and his tribemates came to town with the future of Forest’s Edge on their shoulders.<br/>
Did Pyschkurewuss really exploit the Tsun clan to further his own ends?<br/>
What was he trying to do by demanding for the entire Tsun clan to be handed over to the city?<br/>
What actions would Kamyua Yost and Malfreed take?<br/>
Could the denizens of Forest’s Edge continue to hunt in the Morga Forest?<br/>
Would the Fa house’s business in the Post Station Town continue?<br/>
This might not be the day when all these issues were resolved, but it was definitely a turning point.<br/>
In the end, what we needed to do remained the same.<br/>
As usual, we came to town and sold our food. Aside from the two hunters serving as our guards, everything else remained the same.<br/>
The townsfolk of the Post Station Town didn’t seem to know that such a conference would be held today, and the customer flow appeared the same. There were thirty-odd customers queuing before we opened the stall, and we took turns to rest two at a time after the rush hour was over. Customers visited every now and then during the off-peak period, and things were the same as usual.<br/>
"Dad and the others should be here soon."<br/>
The one speaking leisurely at the back of the stall was Ludo Wu. To avoid spooking the townsfolk of Post Station Town, young people with mild faces were assigned as escorts.<br/>
The other guard was standing between the two stalls and sweeping the streets with her gaze calmly. She was the head of my Fa house, Ai Fa. Now was the hunting offseason for the Wu clan and they could afford to spare the manpower, but Ai Fa still volunteered for this assignment.<br/>
There probably wasn’t any need for escorts this time. Unless relationships between Genos and us fractured irreparably, the guards wouldn’t need to do anything.<br/>
On the other hand, the fact that escorts were assigned showed how fragile the relations between Forest’s Edge and the city was.<br/>
"Ah, it’s Ludo Wu!"<br/>
An energetic voice suddenly called out.<br/>
Then, a person ran towards the stall. It was the daughter of Dora the vegetable peddler, Tara.<br/>
When he saw her, Ludo Wu who was near the wagon answered: "Yo!" and approached her.<br/>
"Long time no see, brat. Don’t you need to work at the stall in the morning?"<br/>
"Yes! Papa asked me to run an errand at the inn!"<br/>
Tara, who had a caramel-brown hair and eyes, smiled cheerfully. She became a regular when I first opened the stall and was no longer afraid of the denizens of Forest’s Edge at the other stall.<br/>
"… Ludo Wu, don’t leave your post. You want to get attacked from the back?"<br/>
Ai Fa admonished him quietly.<br/>
But Ludo Wu just tilted his head puzzledly with a: "Huh?"<br/>
"There’s no need to be so uptight, correct? If we needed to be so wary, we would have sent 3 or 4 escorts right from the start."<br/>
"That might be so, but isn’t it only normal to maximize the efficiency with the manpower available to us?"<br/>
"It’s fine. The Totos and wagon is the wall behind us. We will know right away if someone approaches us from the rear."<br/>
"You… want to use Gilulu as a shield!? Never mind… I’m going to the back."<br/>
From their conversation, it was clear that Ai Fa was the only one on guard the entire morning.<br/>
Unlike that time with Zattsu Tsun and Tay Tsun, we were not expecting anyone to attack us. And the conference was scheduled to start at noon, so there was no reason to expect any troubles in the morning.<br/>
I was worried about Ai Fa, so I left the stall to Lala Wu who was chatting with Ludo Wu and Tara and walked towards Ai Fa.<br/>
"Ai Fa, what’s wrong? You are acting weird since we came to town."<br/>
Ai Fa caressed Gilulu who was tied to the tree and glared at me sideways.<br/>
"… I sense a strange gaze since morning. A malicious and hostile gaze, like poison needles."<br/>
"Ah? Really? But… I thought no one looks at the denizens of Forest’s Edge with such eyes anymore?"<br/>
"That isn’t so. It wasn’t the gaze from the usual group. It’s from people I had never seen before."<br/>
Was she implying someone was spying on us from the dark?<br/>
I hoped Ai Fa was mistaken, but from her serious expression, I wasn’t too optimistic about that.<br/>
"However, would the people from the city only spy on us now…?"<br/>
Before I could finish, I heard Lala Wu wailing: "Hyaa!"<br/>
"What’s the matter, Lala Wu!?"<br/>
I hurried back to the stall.<br/>
A tall figure stood in front of it.<br/>
However, Tara was standing right beside this person, and Ludo Wu didn’t adjust his position either. Lala Wu herself was just standing there with her hands on her hips, and there wasn’t any sense of danger at all.<br/>
"Ah, what a waste! Let me say this first, it’s you whose hand slipped. I won’t refund you the money, you know?"<br/>
What exactly happened?<br/>
I went over together with Ai Fa who was following me closely.<br/>
"Uwah, what happened here?"<br/>
I quickly found out the reason for her wail. A portion of "Myam-roasted meat" was scattered on the griddle.<br/>
The grilled poitan broke apart, scattering the meat and aria inside. To avoid them getting burnt, Lala Wu scraped them to a corner of the griddle with a spatula as she looked at us angrily.<br/>
"As you can see, this customer spilled the food! What a waste, I can’t even!"<br/>
My gaze rested on that customer.<br/>
His 1.8 m tall body was covered by a hooded cloak. His jawline that wasn’t hidden by the hood showed his dark skin. It was a customer from the east.<br/>
I thought for a moment that he was Shumimaru, but that wasn’t so. That man removed his hood and lowered his head apologetically. His hair, tied in a ponytail behind him, was brown, not silver in color.<br/>
"Sorry. I spilled it accidentally. You not wrong, I am."<br/>
He spoke more fluently than Shumimaru.<br/>
Most easterners looked the same to me. He had a long face, narrow eyes, lips, and a high nose bridge, making the typical facial profile of a Semu. He had a tall and slender build and seemed very thin. But his light-colored hair and brown eyes were rare among the Semu.<br/>
And it was even rarer seeing the food being spilled onto the griddle.<br/>
This easterner customer squinted his eyes with a hint of sadness and uncovered the right side of his body. His thin but muscular right arm was wrapped in bloodied bandages.<br/>
"My right arm is hurt, so I wanted to take it with my left hand. Left hand a little clumsy, so spilled. Dirtied the griddle, apologies."<br/>
He was still a little stiff, but he spoke western much better than Shumimaru.<br/>
And it was probably due to his uncommon hair color, but I felt a different air about him compared to Shumimaru.<br/>
Anyway, I felt a sense of goodwill towards this customer.<br/>
"Please don’t mind that. Can you wait for a moment?"<br/>
As the food didn’t fall onto the ground, I couldn’t just waste this "Myam-roasted meat".<br/>
But the crucial part of the dish, the poitan wrap was covered in oil and sauce from the griddle, and it would be difficult to revert it to its original form. By the way, one of the ingredients, the shredded tino was scattered all over.<br/>
Alright then, let’s mash it up.<br/>
I removed the filling from the poitan as best as I could and moved the poitan to the chopping board. I then diced them with a knife and shifted them to a sampling plate.<br/>
I moved the rest of the ingredients to the center of the griddle, added half a spoonful of myam and fruit wine sauce, and then mixed it. Once the cabbage-like tino softened, it was done.<br/>
After shifting these to the plate, I mixed the filling together with the diced grilled poitan.<br/>
"How does this look? It might not look pretty, but the taste should be about the same."<br/>
It looked like a stir-fried dish from Chinese cuisines. It was acceptable to me, but how would he find it?<br/>
That customer smiled happily. I was shocked to see a Semu smile, since they thought that showing emotions was disgraceful.<br/>
"Thank you. No waste copper plates, I’m very thankful."<br/>
The easterner clumsily held the plate with his right hand and used the spoon I gave him to eat the "Myam-roasted meat" bowl.[2]<br/>
The smile on his face brightened.<br/>
"Very delicious. Kiba, very delicious."<br/>
"T-Thank you for your compliment."<br/>
By the way, as Semu people didn’t speak western well, this was the first time I talked so much with an easterner other than Shumimaru.<br/>
"My right arm, injured. Can’t work, for now. So copper plates, precious. I’m very grateful."<br/>
After he quickly finished the  "Myam-roasted meat" bowl blissfully, he said to me.<br/>
"I’m Sangjura. Can tell me, your name?"<br/>
"Yes, I’m Asuta of the Fa house."<br/>
"Asuta of the Fa house. I will be in Genos every day, until I recover. Every day, I come buy from your stall."<br/>
"Thank you very much, I’m happy to hear that."<br/>
"I feel the same. I’m happy to know such a tasty dish."<br/>
Ludo Wu stood beside Lala Wu, while Ai Fa was beside me, and both stared intensely at this smiling customer— the easterner Sangjura.<br/>
"Hmm, you seem really capable. How did you injure your hand?"<br/>
Ludo Wu couldn’t suppress his curiosity and asked.<br/>
Sangjura shook his head in surprise.<br/>
"I rode a Totos to travel. Totos, suddenly fell on a rocky path. I fell off the Totos, and my hand hit a sharp rock."<br/>
"Oh, I see. That explains why such a deft person like you got injured."<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Sangjura blinked in greater surprise.<br/>
"I’m just a wanderer, not a swordsman."<br/>
"Hmm? But you seem to be very strong."<br/>
"… In journey, danger is expected. Bandits, beasts, dangerous. I have learned how to protect myself."<br/>
Sangjura said as he smiled bashfully.<br/>
And then handed me the empty plate.<br/>
"Many thanks for today. I’m grateful to art father Selva of the west."<br/>
"Huh? Sangjura, aren’t you an easterner?"<br/>
"No. My mother, easterner. But I grew up in the western kingdom. I, westerner."<br/>
So Sangjura is a mixed blood of the east and west, huh.<br/>
But that brought another question, why was he speaking western so stiffly? But I couldn’t bring myself to ask that. In this world, being of mixed blood meant a complicated background.<br/>
"Well then, I will be back, tomorrow."<br/>
With that, Sangjura put on his hood and headed south.<br/>
What a pleasant moment, I felt satisfied with myself.<br/>
However, I heard two voices discuss with intense bloodlust:<br/>
"Hmm, to think someone so skilled is in this town… Ai Fa, do you think you can take this guy?"<br/>
"If the terms are the same for both sides, I can. But I probably can’t afford to make any mistakes."<br/>
The two of them were Ai Fa and Ludo Wu, of course.<br/>
When he heard Ai Fa’s icy response, Ludo Wu clicked his tongue with a: "Tch!".<br/>
"Ai Fa, you are that confident of winning? I-I’m not sure… I feel like I might lose…"<br/>
"That’s not for sure, you are on the same level as that man."<br/>
"If you put it that way, that means Ai Fa is stronger than me!"<br/>
"You don’t think so?"<br/>
The killing intent intensified.<br/>
As they were getting heated up, I dowsed cold water on the argument: "Wait, wait."<br/>
"He is just a normal customer, can you not think about things so strangely? He might be capable, but isn’t he warm and gentle?"<br/>
"Well, we only spoke for a while, so who knows if he is friend or foe. You are the one who is too trusting."<br/>
"Ai Fa is right. If the town is full of such people, two guards won’t be enough."<br/>
After saying that, Ludo Wu ruffled his blonde hair.<br/>
"Anyway, we can tell whether there are more of such people after walking around town. That Kamyua Yost and the noble with grey eyes can’t be trifled with either."<br/>
Speaking of which, Ai Fa and Ludo Wu both got into the elite eight of the Wu clan test of might competition. I didn’t know how well they would fare in actual combat, but since both of them regarded him that highly, Sangjura must be exceptionally skilled.<br/>
But anyway… I don’t think he will cause any trouble.<br/>
While I was thinking about all that, Tara who was left alone said loudly: "Tara needs to go home soon!"<br/>
"I want to order one "Myam-roasted meat" and three "Kiba burgers"!"<br/>
"You are eating four portions? That’s incredible."<br/>
"No! This is for the clothes shop owner and the pot dealer uncle!"<br/>
Tara said indignantly, and Ludo Wu laughed out loud.<br/>
The atmosphere finally brightened, and Ai Fa returned to the rear with a shrug. The moment she left, a customer came. They were Dell with uneven-colored brown hair and her escort Lavis.<br/>
When she saw them, Ai Fa stopped in her track.<br/>
"W-Welcome. Do you want to eat the dish from this stall today?"<br/>
"Yes! I have decided to alternate every day, so I will eat here today!"<br/>
Dell was all smiles. I could feel that Ai Fa was looking at her over my shoulder.<br/>
Actually, after Shumimaru left last night, I told Ai Fa about this girl. I thought I should tell Ai Fa that this girl was part of the merchant group invited by Pyschkurewuss to stay in his mansion, and since Ai Fa will be visiting the Post Station Town as a guard, they might run into each other. So I decided to explain everything before any misunderstanding arose.<br/>
I wondered if my judgment was sound and felt incredibly tense.<br/>
"Hmm… There seem to be more people today?"<br/>
Dell surveyed my stall suspiciously.<br/>
When her beautiful green eyes caught sight of Ai Fa, a fire of defiance started burning in them.<br/>
"That’s fine and all, but, that person over there, why are you staring at me? What did I do to you?"<br/>
"… You didn’t do anything to me, but you laid your hands on my family, girl from the south."<br/>
Ai Fa said quietly and walked to my side.<br/>
This development made me break out in cold sweat.<br/>
"Or did Asuta make a move on you first? It’s rare seeing a young southerner girl in the Post Station Town though."<br/>
"What? Are you talking about me hitting Asuta? What has that got to do with you?"<br/>
"It concerns me because Asuta is my family."<br/>
I glanced at Ai Fa from the corner of my eye, and she didn’t look angry. She was just very unhappy, with a cold light shining in her eyes.<br/>
"I must admit that Asuta is at fault too, but I don’t think violence that will leave a mark is right. I hope you can be more careful in the future."<br/>
"Family… What do you mean by family!? Are you two husband and wife!?"<br/>
"N-No, we are not married. We are just a family living under one roof. We are not blood-related, but she is an important family member."<br/>
When she heard my answer, Dell looked even more agitated:<br/>
"If you are not married, what sort of family are you? Is Asuta owned by this woman? Isn’t slavery illegal in the western kingdom, aside from the north?"<br/>
"I-I’m neither a slave nor a pet. Erm, how do I explain this…"<br/>
"No need to explain. Anyway, girl of the south, if you don’t want others to speak badly of you behind your back, be more prudent with your actions and obey the law."<br/>
"You are really annoying. I don’t want to hear you talk about Asuta this or Asuta that! I already apologized to Asuta, and he forgave me! Why are you still telling me all that!?"<br/>
"That’s why I’m just asking you to be careful in the future and not pursue this further. Why won’t you listen?"<br/>
It was becoming a chaotic battle.<br/>
This was also the first time Ai Fa argued with someone in town. I needed to step up and smooth things over… But, what should I do?<br/>
"Hey, calm down a little! Erm… Dell, I did something rude to you, and even though both of us had resolved things, your family would still complain a little, right? That’s how Ai Fa feels, and I hope you can understand."<br/>
"Ah— but…"<br/>
"And Ai Fa, I’m happy that you are worried about me. But didn’t I tell you that I already resolved this amicably? We have both apologized and reflected on it. It’s fine now."<br/>
"But…"<br/>
Both of them shut up with dissatisfied faces.<br/>
But peace didn’t even last five seconds.<br/>
"I was wrong for hitting you, but Asuta was at fault for saying rude things first! Asuta, what gives you the right to admonish me!?"<br/>
"That’s right, this problem was caused by you in the first place. You are the one who needs to reflect the most."<br/>
Ai Fa then leaned in close and continued: "And… how does that girl look like a boy? Aside from dressing like a boy, she seems completely like a girl."<br/>
She then kicked me plenty of times behind the stall.<br/>
"I was wondering how manly that girl looked since you mistook her for a man… Asuta, are those eyeballs just decorations on your face?"<br/>
"That’s too much, you are going too far."<br/>
I rebuked softly, and Ai Fa turned her head exaggeratedly with a grunt.<br/>
When I realized it, Lala Wu was watching this scene with a smile just like Kamyua Yost.<br/>
"Y-You want one portion? Please wait a moment, I will prepare it for you right away!"<br/>
I pulled myself together and started making the "Myam-roasted meat".<br/>
While all this was happening, Ludo Wu observed Lavis who was standing behind Dell, and Lavis was watching Ludo Wu too.<br/>
The young man was probably wary of Ludo Wu and Ai Fa who were in hunter’s garbs and armed with machete and saber. He didn’t seem too tense about Ludo Wu and was merely returning an unfriendly gaze.<br/>
"Oh, Asuta, you are still at the stall!"<br/>
The architect’s group swamped in.<br/>
Arudas who was at the fore of the group laughed heartily.<br/>
"Welcome! Have you been busy lately?"<br/>
"Yes, this job needs to be finished by tomorrow. We will make a loss if we drag on for another day, so we can’t slack off."<br/>
Arudas then drooped his bushy brows.<br/>
"Sigh, I want to stay in Genos forever to eat Asuta’s cooking. But after thinking about the cost of the inn and Totos stable, I can’t do that… Ah, what a pity! Unless there is some urgent job, I will only visit Genos once a year."<br/>
"How many times are you going to say that? Your wife and kids are waiting for you back home."<br/>
The grumpy Pops jabbed Arudas’ stomach.<br/>
He then turned towards me.<br/>
"Asuta… how much jerky do you have left?"<br/>
"Huh? Jerky? I only have this much left today."<br/>
I have been preparing 2 kg of jerky every day.<br/>
After seeing the amount in the sack, Pops grumbled: "That’s not enough."<br/>
"This isn’t enough. I want ten times this amount by tomorrow."<br/>
"T-Ten times? What for do you want so much jerky?"<br/>
"Why else but eating them on the way home, of course? There are eight of us and the journey back takes half a month, so we need ten times more."<br/>
Pops stared at me.<br/>
"Can it be prepared then? If not, I will just have to buy Karon jerky."<br/>
"I-I think I can prepare them. But I can’t be sure unless I go back to Forest’s Edge and check."<br/>
I already told the houses nearby that a big job might come in, and the Wu clan and Lutim house should have that much leftover fresh meat. With the mobility of Gilulu, transporting 20 kg of jerky from the village wasn’t too difficult.<br/>
"But Pops, I thought you don’t like the taste of kiba jerky? The taste of salt and spice in the kiba jerky is strong, so is the taste of kiba…"<br/>
"I know all that. Business like this doesn’t come often, aren’t you going to accept?"<br/>
Pops answered irately and scratched his messy hair.<br/>
"… After eating so much every day, I have gotten used to the kiba flavor. Since the price is the same as Karon jerky, I think kiba is fine too."<br/>
"Ah, if I can’t eat Asuta’s dishes, chewing on kiba jerky can soothe my soul."<br/>
"You are the only one thinking such retarded things!"<br/>
After lashing out at the picky eater Arudas, Pops scratched his head again.<br/>
"Anyway, prepare as much as you can. I will top up the balance with Karon meat. So… I might only drop by in the afternoon tomorrow, so tell the girls tending the stall in advance, alright?"<br/>
"Yes, so will you be coming at noon tomorrow?"<br/>
This might be the moment that we would part.<br/>
I took off the towel on my head and bowed towards the architect group.<br/>
"E-Erm, thank you for taking care of me all this time…"<br/>
"Don’t do that! We are not parting forever!"<br/>
Pops suddenly yelled and slammed two red copper plates on the counter.<br/>
"We will visit Genos once every year! Are you going to bid farewell so annoyingly every time? And there are dozens to hundreds of southerners going in and out of Genos every day."<br/>
"Yes, but my regular patrons are a great source of support for me. I’m really… grateful to everyone."<br/>
Pops looked like he wanted to say something, but he turned his head away without a word.<br/>
His companions behind him all laughed cheerfully.<br/>
"We will still visit after the Blue month! We will eat your share too, Pops, so don’t worry!"<br/>
"Annoying! You want me to send you flying with a kick!?"<br/>
"If you keep dallying, we can’t finish our work by tomorrow! Finish your food already!"<br/>
Some of them were hired locally too. Speaking of which, Pops said he was going back home with 8 other people, but this group had more than ten people.<br/>
Are these people mixed blood or permanent residents of Genos? Or freelancers staying in Genos?<br/>
There was no way to find out.<br/>
However, all of them were my important patrons.<br/>
"Hmmp, are you going back to Nerva?"<br/>
Dell who had shifted to the side asked curiously.<br/>
Pops who was quiet from annoyance scowled and looked back at her.<br/>
"Oh, it’s the girl from Zealand. What, you are actually eating kiba?"<br/>
"Yes, I tried it once and it was delicious! It was so embarrassing of me to complain about it being stinky and tough."<br/>
"Hmmp, I made a bigger fool of myself in the past."<br/>
Pops then glared at me.<br/>
His face looked displeased, but there was a gentle light in his green eyes.<br/>
"Asuta, we will be back tomorrow. I heard things are a little rough right now, but if you shut down your stall before we come back, we will go right into Forest’s Edge to settle things with you."<br/>
"Okay. I will be happy if you taste my cooking next year too."<br/>
I was tearing up before I knew it.<br/>
One year later… Would I still be able to see them again?<br/>
I wasn’t god and didn’t know, so I could only do the best on my part.<br/>
By now, the sun was high above my head, and the meeting between the noble of the city and the Forest’s Edge tribal chiefs would be starting somewhere in Genos soon.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
2<br/>
Kaslan Lutim reported that the conference ended smoothly for today.<br/>
There were 6 participants from Forest’s Edge, namely the three tribal chiefs Donda Wu, Dali Sauti, and Graff Zaza, as well as Kaslan Lutim, the head of the Fou house, and the head of the Beim house. Basically, the followers of the tribal chiefs were replaced by the representatives of the minor houses.<br/>
Our side informed that there would be six attendees, and the people of the city only seemed interested in the tribal chiefs, hence we decided on this lineup.<br/>
The venue was the same as last time, Pyschkurewuss’ mansion.<br/>
However, it wasn’t located in the city. It was a vast orchard and mansion surrounded by rock walls to the north of the city. I didn’t know this place existed since I did my business in the south of the city, or that it was the territory under Pyschkurewuss— the territory of the Count of Turan.<br/>
And the grand Pyschkurewuss mansion was built in a corner of this territory. It seemed that Pyschkurewuss disliked inviting the denizens of Forest’s Edge into the city, so this mansion was used as the meeting venue when the Tsun clan was still the tribal chief clan.<br/>
It was a grand and extravagant building erected from stone instead of timber.<br/>
The tribal chiefs of Forest’s Edge waited in the hall of this building ahead of the agreed time for Pyschkurewuss’ group to arrive.<br/>
The agreed time was noon.<br/>
Kamyua Yost and Malfreed reached just before noon.<br/>
The exterior of the mansion was probably guarded by soldiers, but only three of them came into the hall.<br/>
Kamyua Yost was the same as usual, and Malfreed was dressed in his white armor too. Unlike the denizens of Forest’s Edge whose blades were temporarily confiscated at the entrance, the two of them came in with their swords.<br/>
And so, time passed by slowly, and the toll of the bell announcing the arrival of noon could be heard faintly… At this moment, Pyschkurewuss came into the hall under the escort of twenty guards. Kaslan Lutim then recounted slowly.<br/>
"Fufu… Sorry for the wait, everyone…"<br/>
Pyschkurewuss said as he sat in a large leather-clad chair.<br/>
We stood in the middle of the room. Pyschkurewuss’ guards held spears that were about their height, and half of them lined up against the wall to the left, right and rear.<br/>
The other half surrounded Pyschkurewuss, who turned his gaze towards Malfreed.<br/>
"Lord Malfreed, what a surprise… What good will it do for you to attend this conference…"<br/>
He showed his clear displeasure towards Malfreed’s attendance.<br/>
"I will rule Genos one day after all and don’t think keeping the peace in Genos is a trivial matter, Count Pyschkurewuss Turan."<br/>
Malfreed answered.<br/>
It wasn’t my first time meeting him, but he was an incredible person.<br/>
He took off his helmet in the hall, and I finally got to see his face. He seemed older than me, had light brown hair and proportionate facial features, and looked just like a noble.<br/>
But his grey eyes… were as cold and clear as the moonlight, just like Asuta described.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
I think he was quite formidable as a swordsman.<br/>
But I wasn’t as keen as Ludo Wu and Ai Fa in gauging this so I couldn’t be certain. I just felt that he couldn’t be trifled with.<br/>
Leaving that aside for now, Pyschkurewuss smiled coldly at Malfreed’s response.<br/>
Pyschkurewuss was always smiling.<br/>
He was probably concealing his emotions by smiling.<br/>
"By surprise, I mean the eldest son of Marquis Genos Marstein disguising himself as a plebeian with a dirty piece of cloth… Lord Malfreed, aren’t your actions overstepping your authority as the captain of the castle guards...?"<br/>
"You might not like my way of doing things, but rest assured that I won’t neglect my work. It is my freedom to do what I wish during my free time, Count Pyschkurewuss Turan. That aside… Holding a talk with the tribal chiefs of Forest’s Edge is your duty. How about completing your own duties first?"<br/>
Pyschkurewuss’ smile twisted even further as he cast his gaze towards us.<br/>
What a creepy man.<br/>
No matter how many times I met him, my impression of him remained the same.<br/>
He was dressed as elegantly as a noble, with soft, thin, and white clothes covering his entire body. Only his neck and limbs were bare. His neck and wrists had plenty of metallic and stone accessories, and his attire glittered like that of a woman’s gown.<br/>
Speaking of which, his stature was as thin and petite as a woman. Only his head looked big, which made his body look unbalanced. Instead of a woman, a child would be a more apt description.<br/>
His skin had a strange shade of dark blue and his eyes were bloodshot, resembling a face of a person at ill health.<br/>
Although Graff Zaza and the others called him an "old man", he wasn’t that old. He was just skinny with an unhealthy skin color, making him look much older than he was.<br/>
However… On his lackluster and wrinkled face, his light-colored eyes were full of life.<br/>
Those eyes scared me.<br/>
More specifically, I felt strong disgust towards them.<br/>
I didn’t know the reason.<br/>
The tribal chiefs said: "Those were eyes of contempt, just like Zuro Tsun’s."<br/>
I thought so too. But I felt this wasn’t the only reason.<br/>
An anxiety arose within me, as if I was facing a feral beast that I couldn’t communicate with words… or something like that.<br/>
Anyway, we feared Pyschkurewuss not because of the forceful nature of his words, but because of his eyes.<br/>
"Then I shall do just that then and work on this troublesome task… Tribal chiefs of Forest’s Edge, what punishment did you mete out to the Tsun clan who violated this serious crime…?"<br/>
"Our conclusion remains the same. We think that only Zuro Tsun who guided our tribe down the wrong path needs to be punished further."<br/>
Dali Sauti answered.<br/>
Donda Wu and Graff Zaza had already lost their cool from rage and disgust, so, on that day, the discussion was centered around me and Dali Sauti.<br/>
Pyschkurewuss smiled impatiently.<br/>
"I already gave you more time then agreed on, and you are still so stubborn… So there was no reason to let your tribe deliberate further in the first place…"<br/>
"That isn’t true. We have considered it for many days and discussed countless times before coming here today with an even stronger conviction. If you feel our conclusion is wrong, then I hope you can guide us towards the proper path with your words."<br/>
Dali Sauti was very calm.<br/>
Pyschkurewuss was still smiling.<br/>
"My thinking remains the same as the last few days, punishment for the crime… The seriousness of the crime between the mastermind and those who are ordered is, of course, different so the law officer in Genos will decide on the sentencing…"<br/>
"You said the same thing a few days ago. But doesn’t the Forest’s Edge settlement have the right to judge and punish denizens who transgressed the law by themselves? The people in the city have no rights to complain about how we deal with the denizens of Forest’s Edge in the first place."<br/>
"That’s because the rules in Forest’s Edge are more strict than the laws of Genos… If you followed your own rules and scalped their heads, we would see no need to interfere…"<br/>
Pyschkurewuss said in a ridiculous tone.<br/>
"It is a known fact that the denizens of Forest’s Edge can govern themselves, and you also have the authority to sentence your own people too… So we can’t accept that you are punishing your own people in a more lenient way than what the Genos law dictates…"<br/>
"But why? Isn’t the punishment meted out as a judgment of the seriousness of the crime? That’s why we have chosen to punish all members of the Tsun clan in accordance to their sins."<br/>
"And the criminals escaped and committed new crimes because you didn’t execute them like you should have…?"<br/>
And of course, he was referring to Zattsu Tsun and Tay Tsun.<br/>
"Not punishing the criminals justly and failure to maintain public order in Genos… The incident I mentioned proved this point, correct…? If the denizens of Forest’s Edge don’t have the resolve to execute the criminals, then let us handle it before more harm is done..."<br/>
I decided to interject here.<br/>
Because I could sense intense rage from Graff Zaza’s face.<br/>
"Please allow me to share my opinion. You mentioned the resolve to execute the criminals, but is executing criminals indiscriminately the correct resolve…? After careful consideration of the Tsun Clan’s behavior, we have decided to sentence Zattsu Tsun and Zuro Tsun to death, and guide the others back on the proper path."<br/>
"Fufu… Isn’t it the unspoken law amongst the denizens of Forest’s Edge that the rules of Forest’s Edge are absolute…? I am skeptical about the weak attitude of twisting the rules to forgive the criminals, which is different from the style of the Forest’s Edge…"<br/>
"The rules need to be respected. But if someone was force-fed the grace of the forest, do you think they should be scalped? We don’t."<br/>
Pyschkurewuss’ mouth twisted in a smile, and he looked at each of us one at a time.<br/>
"I have wondered about this since the conference a few days ago; you sure have a way with words for a young Forest’s Edge hunter… Why don’t we elect a talent like you to be the tribal chief and lead the denizens of Forest’s Edge to a bright future…?"<br/>
Pyschkurewuss often said things to taunt the tribal chiefs.<br/>
Before Graff Zaza burst out in anger, I answered:<br/>
"You are mistaken, I’m just speaking on behalf of the tribal chiefs. Just like you representing the Lord of Genos, Marstein."<br/>
Pyschkurewuss was momentarily silent.<br/>
But a vicious smile returned to his face.<br/>
"It is our fault that Zattsu Tsun and Tay Tsun escaped, which put the townsfolk in the Post Station Town in danger. It is as you say, if we executed Zuro Tsun and Zattsu Tsun on the spot, the disaster a few days ago would have been avoided."<br/>
If we kept lingering on the same subject, the problem wouldn’t be solved. I decided to answer him.<br/>
"But thanks to that, we have learned a lot of new facts too. Pyschkurewuss, what are your thoughts about that?"<br/>
"… What are you referring to…?"<br/>
"I refer to Zattsu Tsun and Tay Tsun assaulting the fake caravan group and confessing that they committed the same devious thing ten years before."<br/>
Pyschkurewuss raised the corner of his mouth in a smile.<br/>
It was a displeasing smile.<br/>
"This is ridiculous… At best, this is a nonsensical rambling of a dying villain… We can’t believe such nonsense…"<br/>
"Yes, there is no longer any evidence of the crimes in the past. But there is no doubt that they attacked the fake caravan and that the same thing happened a decade ago. And… there have always been rumors that the culprit is a denizen of Forest’s Edge, correct?"<br/>
"Rumors are just rumors… They are not facts…"<br/>
"Is that true? I heard that an evidence that proved the murderer is a denizen of Forest’s Edge was found ten years ago."<br/>
Pyschkurewuss was quiet for a moment.<br/>
The leader of the caravan died with a hunter’s necklace from the Forest’s Edge in his hands. I had never imagined that I will learn this truth.<br/>
Kamyua Yost and Malfreed who told us that stayed silent.<br/>
"And we also heard about the denizens of Forest’s Edge not being brought to task after committing countless crimes. Are these all baseless rumors?"<br/>
"Nothing more than rumors… To be swayed by such rumors, and you call yourselves denizens of Forest’s Edge…?"<br/>
Pyschkurewuss caught his breath and then started speaking:<br/>
"I don’t know what you mean by countless crimes, but I do know about the caravan being attacked ten years ago… However, the young hunter from Forest’s Edge, the culprit for that incident has already been executed…"<br/>
"I see, so that’s how it is."<br/>
I already heard about this from Kamyua Yost, so wasn’t surprised at all.<br/>
Pyschkurewuss looked at me with a sharp gaze.<br/>
"The culprit for that incident was the ‘Red Beard Gang" whose base of operation is around Genos… Those bandits have all been apprehended and brought to justice…  Young hunter from Forest’s Edge, there is no reason to doubt this fact…"<br/>
"A bandit gang, huh. Then how do you explain the hunter’s necklace in the merchant’s hand?"<br/>
"How would I know such details… But the horns and tusks of kiba can be bought in the western kingdom. Doesn’t your tribe sell them in exchange for money…?"<br/>
Although kiba tusks and horns weren’t sold in Genos, they were peddled off to various cities as a type of materials.<br/>
After buying or stealing these tusks and horns anyone could make a hunter’s necklace.<br/>
"That caravan was planning to go through the Morga Forest and head to the eastern city… Did the ‘Red Beard Gang’ want to make the denizens of Forest’s Edge their scapegoats…? What a shallow scheme, and those who got fooled by this should be ashamed…"<br/>
"Yes, but it’s not an easy feat to convince the people in the Post Station Town though?"<br/>
Kamyua Yost spoke for the first time.<br/>
Pyschkurewuss glared at him with murky eyes.<br/>
"Speaking of the ‘Red Beard Gang’, I heard they were against murder and just robbed from the rich and gave to the poor. They were thieves of justice and very reputable. A decade ago, when I was a new guardian, their exploits had already spread to the neighboring towns. No one would have believed back then that the ‘Red Beard Gang’ wiped the entire caravan out and pushed the blame to other people."<br/>
"… Calling them thieves of justice is a lie… They are just a bunch of outlaws…"<br/>
"That is true for the targeted nobles, but not the peasants. Thinking back, when the ‘Red Beard Gang’ that was revered as heroes got executed in place of the denizens of Forest’s Edge, that fueled the animosity of the people towards the denizens of Forest’s Edge."<br/>
Kamyua Yost smiled retardedly as usual.<br/>
Pyschkurewuss was also smiling, but his bloodshot eyes were dripping with hate.<br/>
"Aren’t you Malfreed’s follower…? Since you are just his follower, know your place…"<br/>
"I’m speaking on behalf of my silent friend right now. If anything I said went against Malfreed’s thoughts, he would have stopped me, so don’t worry."<br/>
Pyschkurewuss shifted his gaze onto Malfreed.<br/>
Malfreed remained silent.<br/>
"Continuing with the topic earlier, as the young hunter from Forest’s Edge Kaslan Lutim mentioned, there are rumors in the Post Station Town of the various crimes committed by the denizens of Forest’s Edge… such as abducting women, stealing crops, and assaulting travelers. The strange thing is, all these were pushed to the ‘Red Beard Gang’, and they were executed for them. Whenever a member of the ‘Red Beard Gang’ got executed, there were rumors of the denizens of Forest’s Edge committing these crimes. Even though the rumors coming before the execution would make more sense."<br/>
"…"<br/>
"These incidents stopped in these ten years. It remains unclear whether the reason is the execution of the leader of the ‘Red Beard Gang’, or because Zattsu Tsun, the former head of the Tsun clan, fell ill."<br/>
At this moment, Pyschkurewuss’ face changed drastically.<br/>
He was still smiling… but somehow, it felt like the smile of a munto that fed on carrion.<br/>
Although I have never seen a munto smile before.<br/>
"So… What are you trying to say, swordsman who resembles a northerner…?"<br/>
"It is as you say, I have the blood of a northerner. But the god I worship is the western god. Anyway… Leaving those trivial details aside, the denizens of Forest’s Edge are being accused of not getting punished no matter what crimes they commit. And they got away scot-free by sacrificing the lives of others… The ‘Red Beard Gang’ has faded into obscurity after ten years, and only these rumors remain. Until a few days ago, when Zattsu Tsun and Tay Tsun confessed to their crimes."<br/>
"…"<br/>
"It was unnatural for the ‘Red Beard Gang’ to set an ambush in the middle of the Morga Forest in the first place, with all the kiba roaming around. If I were them, I would have attacked them when they left the forest, just before entering the city. This way, there would be less risk of kiba attack, and I could push the crime to the denizens of Forest’s Edge. It’s more natural to think that the culprit behind the attack ten years ago was Zattsu Tsun’s gang, isn’t that so?"<br/>
"There’s no point in debating this… Whether the criminal is the former head of the Tsun clan or the ‘Red Beard Gang’ bandits, all of them have been brought to justice… No matter how hard we try now, we won’t be able to find any evidence…"<br/>
Pyschkurewuss wetted his disgustingly discolored lips and answered unwaveringly.<br/>
"But, is there really a need for evidence…? There is no doubt that they were the culprits… The ‘Red Beard Gang’ were bandits that targeted the nobility and the wealthy, while the former Tsun clan head trampled on the grace of the Morga forest and even committed arson… All the criminals have paid for their crimes with their lives… and the issues have been appropriately resolved…"<br/>
Kamyua Yost snickered and then asked: "Appropriately resolved, huh. What about the devious crimes that happened after the caravan was assaulted ten years ago?"<br/>
He resembled some kind of animal when he smiled.<br/>
"These might be old news, but you didn’t forget them, did you? The envoy from the Banam city, which was closely related to Genos, got wiped out, and the former captain of the town guards was murdered. Can you say for certain that the ‘Red Beard Gang’ was behind both these incidents?"<br/>
"…"<br/>
"Speaking of which, there were rumors in town that the denizens of Forest’s Edge were behind this."<br/>
"…"<br/>
"All this doesn’t add up. If the ‘Red Beard Gang’ did this, why did they break their principle of not committing murder? If Zattsu Tsun did this, why go after the captain of the town guards? Maybe attacking the envoy makes sense… But the captain of the town guards won’t walk around town with gold and other accessories on him."<br/>
"That means the ‘Red Beard Gang’ is behind this… It is the duty of the town guards to subjugate the bandits, so it is no surprise if they hold a grudge against the captain…"<br/>
"No, no, pinning all this on the ‘Red Beard Gang’ was done after the new captain took the post. There’s no need to say too much… He is the younger brother of Lord Pyschkurewuss, captain Shileru."<br/>
"…"<br/>
"Thanks to the work of the new captain Shileru, the ‘Red Beard Gang’ was subjugated. Zattsu Tsun and the others got away scot-free after all this got pinned to the ‘Red Beard Gang’, and the seed of suspicion towards the denizens of Forest’s Edge was planted deep into the heart of the townsfolk."<br/>
"I never heard of something so outrageous before…"<br/>
"You might not have heard of this in the city. But this is the reality in the Post Station Town. After the ‘Red Beard Gang’ faded into obscurity, the townsfolk started to fear and ostracize the denizens of Forest’s Edge."<br/>
Kamyua Yost said with a shrug.<br/>
"Like I said, thanks to Zattsu Tsun confessing to his crime from ten years ago, a wind of change is brewing… But this is really strange. The ‘Red Beard Gang’ was accused of pinning the crime on the denizens of Forest’s Edge, when in fact the ‘Red Beard Gang’ became a scapegoat for a crime perpetrated by a denizen of Forest’s Edge… The crime committed by Zattsu Tsun. What made captain Shileru so sure that all this was the doing of the ‘Red Beard Gang’? Were there any red beards left behind at the crime scene?"<br/>
"You can ask Shileru about that…"<br/>
"Malfreed already did. But he lacked enough evidence to convince my friend."<br/>
Everyone turned quiet momentarily.<br/>
With a cold smile on his lips, Pyschkurewuss said slowly:<br/>
"I don’t know about that… Even so, all the criminals have been executed… Whether those crimes were committed by the Tsun clan former head or the bandits, what has that got to do with us…?"<br/>
"Yes, that’s the issue here. If all the criminals have been brought to justice, there is no point in bringing up old news. However, we can’t sit by idly if the mastermind behind all this is still scot-free."<br/>
Kamyua Yost’s smile remained unchanged.<br/>
Malfreed was still expressionless.<br/>
"Zattsu Tsun was a denizen of Forest’s Edge and had almost no knowledge of the outside world. So it was strange for him to attack the Banam envoy and the town guards outside Genos."<br/>
"That’s why this is the doing of the bandits…"<br/>
"Instead of the ‘Red Beard Gang’ breaking their principle of not murdering people out of the blue, wouldn’t it be more natural to assume that Zattsu Tsun had help from the outside?"<br/>
Kamyua Yost subtly cut off Pyschkurewuss’ words.<br/>
"By the way, external help is a must if they want to launder the goods they robbed from the caravan and envoy. Someone coerced Zattsu Tsun to attack… And that someone might also have the hidden agenda of wiping out the Banam envoy. Didn’t some of the people in the city think that continuing business with Banam would be bad for their trade?"<br/>
"…"<br/>
"And if this is pinned on the ‘Red Beard Gang’, you can also get rid of the bandits who were an eyesore to the aristocrats."<br/>
"You are delusional, this is all nonsense…"<br/>
"Is that so? My friend had not interrupted me once. Anyway… We disguised ourselves as a caravan based on this deduction. We still didn’t uncover the real mastermind, but we managed to prove that Zattsu Tsun was behind the incident ten years ago."<br/>
Malfreed stood beside the grinning Kamyua Yost and stared quietly at Pyschkurewuss.<br/>
Silence engulfed the hall once again.<br/>
There was a sense of danger in this silence.<br/>
Finally, Pyschkurewuss said in a strangely hoarse voice: "It’s as if…"<br/>
"It’s as if you are accusing me of being the mastermind behind all this…"<br/>
Kamyua Yost didn’t answer.<br/>
Pyschkurewuss was like munto hiding in the dark, with a dim glow in his eyes.<br/>
"High-quality mamaria and fuwano are grown in Banam... If we continue trading with them, at the very least, the orchard in my Turan territory will suffer a lot…"<br/>
"…"<br/>
"And the captain of the town guards is my brother Shileru, and I also continue to be the liaison with the Forest’s Edge… You are implying that if there is a mastermind behind these series of events, no one is more suspicious than me, correct…?"<br/>
Malfreed answered coldly: "There is no doubt that you are the biggest suspect."<br/>
Pyschkurewuss slowly moved his sights onto him.<br/>
"What a surprise… Lord Malfreed, are you seriously slandering me…? Slandering me, the head of the Count Turan house…?"<br/>
"This is no slander. I’m merely stating the fact you are a suspect. I can’t pass judgment without any evidence."<br/>
Malfreed used his grey eyes devoid of any human emotions to intimidate Pyschkurewuss.<br/>
This felt like a standoff between a Madarama snake and a munto.<br/>
"And of course, if there is evidence, a criminal is a criminal. It doesn’t matter whether they are a noble or a commoner. I will wield the blade of justice in accordance with the law of Genos."<br/>
"If there is evidence… Splendid… Wonderful words from the captain of the castle guards, the ones who uphold the law…"<br/>
Pyschkurewuss seemed relieved.<br/>
He was like a munto retreating into the depths of the woods after seeing the Madarama snake had already eaten its full.<br/>
Malfreed and Kamyua Yost’s questioning ended for the day.<br/>
What followed was the negotiation between us, the denizens of Forest’s Edge, and Pyschkurewuss. Dali Sauti and I looked at each other, unsure who should speak first.<br/>
But Donda Wu acted before we did, moving his body a little as if he was wiping the dangerous air out of the hall, and said:<br/>
"… Is this your so-called law, representative of the Genos landlord?"<br/>
Donda Wu’s voice was very calm.<br/>
Pyschkurewuss slowly turned his head towards him.<br/>
"I don’t really understand complicated matters, but I can’t find a shred of logic from your words, representative of the Genos’ landlord."<br/>
"What a shocking statement… Wavering because of baseless ramblings is a sign of foolishness, tribal chief of the Forest’s Edge…"<br/>
"Then can you prove that incident a decade ago was the doing of the bandits? The hunter’s necklace found at the crime scene, Zattsu Tsun and Tay Tsun confessing their crimes. With all that in mind, what is your reason for thinking that this was the doing of the ‘Red Beard Gang"?"<br/>
"… The one who judged them to be the culprits wasn’t me, but the captain of the town guards…"<br/>
"Isn’t that captain your younger brother? Then please call him here."<br/>
The hall turned rowdy.<br/>
The spear bearing guards slowly lost their calm.<br/>
Probably because of Donda Wu’s aura.<br/>
Donda Wu sounded very calm, but a smile appeared on his face.<br/>
The smile he has when facing an enemy.<br/>
We weren’t moving at all, but the guards seemed ready to thrust their spears at a moment’s notice.<br/>
"Zattsu Tsun is suspected of committing grave crimes in the Forest’s Edge too. My Wu clan’s relationship with them was already very tense twenty years ago. But they didn’t commit their felonies openly, so we could only bear with them for the past two decades."<br/>
Pyschkurewuss’ face didn’t change at all.<br/>
His body was as small as a child and weak as if he was ill. But this man had the guts to withstand Donda Wu’s aura.<br/>
Maybe he had met with Zattsu Tsun many times before Zattsu Tsun fell ill, and got used to the intimidating air of a Forest’s Edge hunter.<br/>
But droplets of sweat seemed to be appearing on his bluish-black smiling face.<br/>
"That is trivial compared to the recent incidents in town. I already said that those bastards from the Tsun clan are free to draw their blades and damage stalls in the Post Station Town without any repercussion. Even if they get brought in for questioning, someone from the city would settle the problem with money… Can you tell me the reason why the denizens of Forest’s Edge aren’t being judged as criminals?"<br/>
"This has nothing to do with me… Maintaining the peace in the Post Station Town isn’t under my purview, but the responsibility of the town guards…"<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
"That’s why you should get your younger brother to come over… No…"<br/>
Donda Wu’s grin grew even wider.<br/>
"Let’s call the Genos landlord over then. Or should we head over to the city to invite him?"<br/>
Pyschkurewuss put his arm on the armrest and leaned his body to the right.<br/>
I could feel that his mind was churning.<br/>
"Tribal chief of the Forest’s Edge… Marquis Marstein Genos has already entrusted the negotiations with the denizens of Forest’s Edge to me… Aren’t you being too arrogant, if you are asking me to invite Marquis Genos…?"<br/>
"We offered our blades to the landlord of Genos, not you. If we can’t resolve this with you, we can only escalate the matter up to the landlord."<br/>
Donda Wu said in a booming voice.<br/>
His smile was gradually becoming that of a hunter.<br/>
"We didn’t have any proof, that’s why the Tsun clan was allowed to act out of line and trouble others. Not just the denizens of Forest’s Edge, they troubled the people in the Post Station Town too. We… don’t want to make the same mistake."<br/>
"Which means… you don’t trust me, huh…"<br/>
Fufu… Pyschkurewuss showed a devious smile.<br/>
"In that case, tribal chiefs of the Forest’s Edge, I don’t trust you very much, so please let someone else be your representative… If I said that, would you understand what I’m thinking…?"<br/>
"What…?"<br/>
Donda Wu glared furiously.<br/>
The guards readied their spears, but Pyschkurewuss stopped them.<br/>
"I won’t say something so hostile… but I don’t really trust you that much… Heads of the Wu clan, Zaza house, and Sauti clan, whether you are qualified to be tribal chiefs… I have my doubts about that…"<br/>
Donda Wu restrained the enraged Graff Zaza as he asked: "What do you mean?"<br/>
"Tribal chiefs, I’m suspecting you… You didn’t execute the members of the Tsun clan who committed grave sins, and even let Zattsu Tsun got away… If you also allow Zuro Tsun to escape, no blood will be spilled… I’m suspecting whether this is all a scam…"<br/>
"Impossible! Are you saying we let Zattsu Tsun and Tay Tsun escape on purpose!?"<br/>
Graff Zaza finally roared.<br/>
Pyschkurewuss smiled cockily.<br/>
"I don’t want to suspect you either… But your actions are soft, unlike the denizens of Forest’s Edge. You forgave the criminals and let Zattsu Tsun who was to be executed to escape. Completely unlike my impression of Forest’s Edge denizens… And you even got fooled by lies and slandered me…"<br/>
"Is this your answer, representative of the Genos Lord?"<br/>
Donda Wu raised an arm to stop Graff Zaza who wanted to yell again, and said calmly:<br/>
"We can’t trust each other… So the talks are at an impasse?"<br/>
Then I can only ask the Genos Lord for his true intention with my blade personally… I thought Donda Wu would say that and, honestly speaking, I was very anxious.<br/>
Pyschkurewuss probably thought the same way.<br/>
After a short silence, Pyschkurewuss said in a more serious tone:<br/>
"It’s still too early to come to a conclusion, tribal chiefs of the Forest’s Edge… We have only just met… I think we need more time to build a strong relationship of trust…"<br/>
"Fufu. Then what do you think we should do? Repeat the same questions, like scratching the scar that hasn’t fully healed yet?"<br/>
"We need time to think, but going over the same content is meaningless… So I will take a step back as a show of trust and goodwill…"<br/>
Pyschkurewuss said:<br/>
"I will trust your judgment on the branch house members who violated the taboo under the coercion of the former clan head, and not pursue their crimes further… But I want you to hand over the clan head and the six other main house members… This decision is a show of my trust…"<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
"… The talks continued for a while longer, but there wasn’t anything worth mentioning."<br/>
Kaslan Lutim finished his detailed report.<br/>
I did my preparation work as I listened and exhaled the sigh that I had been holding in.<br/>
"Thank you for your hard work. Kaslan Lutim, your memory and the way you recount the entire meeting is top-notch."<br/>
"You flatter me. I have covered all the important points though."<br/>
"Yes, that’s good enough. Just understanding the content takes a lot of effort."<br/>
I was the one who asked him to tell me about the meeting, but I didn’t expect the briefing to be so detailed.<br/>
We weren’t in the Fa house, but the kitchen of the Wu clan main house.<br/>
Ai Fa stood behind me as she listened to the report, while Leina Wu and Shela Wu were studying how to make hamburg steak further inside. I have decided to teach them how to make "Kiba burger" from today onwards.<br/>
"I consulted Kamyua ahead of time, but this is the first time I heard of the ‘Red Beard Gang’."<br/>
"Yes. I only know that they were a bunch of bandits. Since we are not directly involved, he thought there wasn’t any point in telling us about them."<br/>
"But I have never heard that name from anyone in town, and it makes me intrigued even more."<br/>
The thieves of justice being forgotten by the people after ten years wasn’t anything surprising.<br/>
But since Kamyua Yost kept mentioning them… Were they a crucial existence?<br/>
And this was the first time I heard about the Banam envoys and the captain of the town guards.<br/>
They were probably the "people sort of like a political enemy of Pyschkurewuss" that Kamyua Yost was talking about. But from their conversation, the envoy sounded closer to being business competitors instead of political enemies.<br/>
"Yes, it’s great that he conceded the point on the branch house members, but to think he would blame us for Zattsu Tsun’s escape."<br/>
"Yes. We have no excuses about that, so Graff Zaza could only suppress his anger."<br/>
The situation wasn’t optimistic at all.<br/>
Pyschkurewuss claimed to have lowered the terms as a sign of trust; we, on the other hand, had shown our hand from the very start, pointing the forthrightness of Forest’s Edge. This was the best way we came up with after careful deliberation.<br/>
He definitely didn’t care about the branch house in the first place. However…<br/>
I already knew that Pyschkurewuss would make an outrageous demand, a trademark of the negotiation style of the city people. He was just displaying his authority towards the new tribal chiefs.<br/>
However, things changed a lot over the past few days.<br/>
Pyschkurewuss who continuously had been turning a blind eye to the Tsun clan’s wrongdoings was now suspected of being the mastermind behind a series of incidents.<br/>
Could Pyschkurewuss be a vicious man, and Zattsu Tsun’s gang was just coerced by them? Just how would this incident end?<br/>
At the very least, he wants to seal Zuro Tsun’s lips.<br/>
Tay Tsun once claimed that he was the only one aside from Zattsu Tsun who knew about Zattsu Tsun’s delusion of grandeur. He also said that the weak Zuro Tsun couldn’t inherit this will.<br/>
Even without this confession, as the clan head, Zuro Tsun could very likely have gotten hold of Zattsu Tsun’s crimes. The possibility of him knowing the relationship between Zattsu Tsun and Pyschkurewuss wasn’t zero. In short, he was an existence that Pyschkurewuss couldn’t ignore.<br/>
However, he just needed to accept the Forest’s Edge chiefs opinion and extradite Zuro Tsun into the city as a criminal. With Malfreed stepping in, Pyschkurewuss was probably feeling the heat, so there was no reason in dragging out the meeting.<br/>
But he was still insisting that we hand over all the members of the main house… Was he worried about his secret being leaked to them?<br/>
If that is true, this is no joking matter. How can we hand Yamiel Lei, Mida, and the others to this despicable man now?<br/>
After thinking about it this far, I finally finished cutting the meat.<br/>
I placed the Santoku knife onto the counter and then turned towards Kaslan Lutim and said:<br/>
"So, the next meeting is set in half a month’s time?"<br/>
"Yes. We need to decide before the 15th of the White month."<br/>
Tomorrow was the 31st of the Blue month, so that would be half a month away.<br/>
He sure was taking his time.<br/>
"Why is he leaving such a large gap in between? Our tribal chiefs can consider this carefully, and Kamyua Yost can conduct more investigations. This is great for us, but what does Pyschkurewuss intend to gain by leaving so many days blank?"<br/>
"Don’t know. But I don’t think he is someone who will do something that doesn’t benefit himself."<br/>
"Yes. Kaslan Lutim seems to really detest Pyschkurewuss, correct?"<br/>
Kaslan Lutim nodded seriously in response.<br/>
"I know I shouldn’t mix in my personal feelings in this, but even without being enemies, I probably won’t ever be friends with that man."<br/>
Pyschkurewuss was actually so detestable and made others so wary. I had not seen him in person yet, so my impression of him was very vague.<br/>
However, I could understand what Kamyua Yost meant that they couldn’t bring Pyschkurewuss right now. No matter how suspicious he might be, there still wasn’t any concrete evidence.<br/>
From the circumstantial evidence, we could infer that Pyschkurewuss and his brother who was the captain of the town guards might have colluded with Zattsu Tsun and planned the whole thing.<br/>
Or maybe this entire thing had nothing to do with the people in the city, and Zattsu Tsun just wanted to barter the stolen goods for copper plates.<br/>
Or maybe… Zattsu Tsun and Tay Tsun were lying, and this was all the doing of the bandits.<br/>
Without evidence, anything was possible.<br/>
"Hmmm. Is his personality just twisted, or did he really exploit Zattsu Tsun to commit all these crimes… I don’t think we can continue to negotiate without clearing this up."<br/>
"That’s right. Kamyua Yost also mentioned that we have to get the evidence during this period of time. In order to do so, he hopes the denizens of Forest’s Edge can lend him a hand."<br/>
Kamyua Yost, huh.<br/>
That suspicious man with a retarded smile was having a private conference with the tribal chiefs inside the Wu clan main house. I wondered how much help the Forest’s Edge would be in this conspiracy-laced incident. I couldn’t imagine that at all and couldn’t calm down.<br/>
I wondered what Ai Fa who had been keeping quiet thought. When I was about to turn and look her way, Leina Wu walked up to me with a freshly grilled hamburg steak on a plate.<br/>
"Asuta, I made it as you instructed. Can you try the finished product?"<br/>
The meat patty on the plate was about 180 g, around the size used in a "Kiba burger", and grilled just right.<br/>
The color and tenderness were impeccable. Even though the patty didn’t have any condiments on it, it still should be incredibly delicious.<br/>
I relaxed my serious face, picked up a spoon and said: "I’m digging in."<br/>
I cut the patty with my spoon, and a translucent liquid flowed onto the plate.<br/>
The inside of the patty was thoroughly cooked too.<br/>
I sent the piece of meat into my mouth, and the deliciousness I was expecting spread inside my mouth cavity.<br/>
"Yes, this is perfect. The amount of diced aria is just right, and the tenderness of the meat is outstanding… It’s been a while since I ate meat patty without any sauce; the kiba is really tasty."<br/>
In the meat patty were just diced aria and a dash of rock salt and Pico leaves, but that was already incredibly delicious. I couldn’t help smiling, and Leina Wu also smiled happily when she saw me.<br/>
"I wanted to ask if you really mean it, but I feel relieved just looking at Asuta’s face. I think the meat patty is a little too big though."<br/>
"Well, the meat patty will be stored inside Pico leaves before being grilled on the morning and will lose a lot of moisture. So we need to make it this thick at this juncture."<br/>
"Ah, so that’s the reason. I understand. So… Can you let Shela Wu and I take on the task of preparing 60 meat patties?"<br/>
"Okay, I will leave this to you then. Please try to make them the same size, okay?"<br/>
Leina Wu replied with a smile: "Okay."<br/>
It was a perfect smile, full of pride and confidence.<br/>
Leina Wu’s facial features had always been fine, but I thought she had gotten even more charming lately.<br/>
"Oh, Ai Fa and Kaslan Lutim, want to have a taste? If I leave it all to Asuta, he will be full before dinner."<br/>
Leina Wu was always so considerate.<br/>
Kaslan Lutim nodded generously and took the spoon from me.<br/>
"Ah, this is heavenly. I hope the women in house Lutim can learn such skills too."<br/>
"Ara, Ema Min Lutim’s hamburg steak tastes delicious too, right?"<br/>
Leina Wu smiled bashfully, and Kaslan Lutim scratched his head with a: "Haha."<br/>
After seeing this warm interaction between them, Ai Fa picked up the spoon awkwardly.<br/>
She then scooped up a small piece and shoved it into her mouth.<br/>
Ai Fa said with a blank face: "Hmm… Leina Wu’s cooking has improved a lot."<br/>
Leina Wu asked happily: "Really?"<br/>
"It’s encouraging to hear Ai Fa saying that since she eats Asuta’s cooking every day."<br/>
Leina Wu who was all smiles and the expressionless Ai Fa looked at each other in silence for a moment.<br/>
Before this silence turned awkward, Leina Wu looked back at me:<br/>
"Well then, I’m going back to work. Thank you very much, Asuta."<br/>
"Sorry for troubling you."<br/>
Leina Wu turned back and returned to Shela Wu with brisk steps.<br/>
And… she didn’t seem to notice that I was a little worried about Ai Fa. It looked like she was trying to suppress her own emotions.<br/>
"… Hey, Ai Fa, are you alright?":<br/>
I whispered to her quietly.<br/>
Is she going to tell me: "The hamburg steak you make for me tastes better than that!"? I felt a little uneasy.<br/>
Ai Fa scratched the tip of her nose; she moved her mouth as if she couldn’t hold it in anymore.<br/>
She made a face I wasn’t expecting… She looked very satisfied, with a proud and confident smile that was on par with Leina Wu earlier.<br/>
After surprising me, Ai Fa whispered to me with a smile:<br/>
"… She had improved a lot, but Asuta’s hamburg steak still tastes better."<br/>
After saying that, she poked my sideburn.<br/>
"But her improvement surprised me a lot. Asuta, don’t fall behind now."<br/>
I could only answer: "Yes…"<br/>
Compared to Leina Wu’s and Shela Wu’s, my hamburg steak wasn’t that far ahead… I felt a sense of shame as I thought that and decided not to tell anyone about this.<br/>
"Hyaa! Asuta, what goodies are you eating!"<br/>
I heard a sudden yell.<br/>
A tall and slender figure was standing at the kitchen entrance together with a petite person.<br/>
They were Kamyua Yost and Ludo Wu.<br/>
"Ara, thank you for your hard work. Your private conference with the tribal chiefs is over?"<br/>
"Yes, I finally got them to agree to my request. We should be able to grab Pyschkurewuss by the tail before the 15th of next month."<br/>
Kamyua Yost answered as he stared at the plate in my hands.<br/>
Ludo Wu who noticed that walked right in and snatched the plate from me.<br/>
"Since it’s my house’s kitchen, can I have a taste?"<br/>
"Ahh, Ludo Wu, save some for me, at least a bite."<br/>
Kamyua Yost was treating Ludo Wu so casually that it felt weird to me.<br/>
But Ludo Wu didn’t seem to mind this suspicious man and left just a bite of hamburg steak to him as requested.<br/>
"Oh, Kaslan Lutim, thank you for your hard work. Have you explained everything to Asuta?"<br/>
Kamyua Yost ate the bite of hamburg steak cherishingly as he said that to Kaslan Lutim.<br/>
"I have explained everything that I could to him."<br/>
"That’s great. Let me add on to that."<br/>
Kamyua Yost said with a leisurely smile: "Asuta, after listening to what Kaslan Lutim said, you probably think that Pyschkurewuss is a vicious man."<br/>
"That’s right."<br/>
"But Asuta, if you get a chance to meet Pyschkurewuss, your impression of him might get overturned. I hope you won’t think Kaslan Lutim’s impression of him is mistaken."<br/>
"What?"<br/>
I was confused by his words.<br/>
But I could sense that Kamyua Yost, the man who was always pretending to be retarded, had very serious eyes.<br/>
"I’m sorry, I don’t understand you at all. Can you explain further?"<br/>
"Ah, my bad. Well, I’m sure of this only during today’s meeting. Pyschkurewuss looks down on the denizens of Forest’s Edge. Much more than I expected."<br/>
"Looks down on the denizens of Forest’s Edge?"<br/>
"Correct. Those weren’t eyes one looks at a fellow man. Instead, it gave impression as if he was looking at a filthy animal beneath that of a man."<br/>
Kamyua Yost said something dangerous offhandedly.<br/>
"Simply put, those are his eyes when looking at a slave. And… he is someone who doesn’t think of slaves as people. The slaves in the western kingdom are actually from the northern kingdom."<br/>
"From the northern kingdom, that means…"<br/>
"Yes, where my mother is from, the enemy of the western kingdom, Mahildra. Pyschkurewuss has always loathed a northern mixed blood like me entering the city on Marquis Genos’ invitation. And, of course… he also looks at me as if I am some kind of filthy animal."<br/>
"…"<br/>
"Genos is located close to the southern edge of the western kingdom. The people here will probably never meet anyone from Mahildra in their lifetime. But that Pyschkurewuss went out of his way to get slave merchants to travel here from the north to buy slaves to work for him. This is nothing special in the northern cities though. The captives from a hostile nation are either killed or enslaved."<br/>
I felt more and more troubled as I listened.<br/>
But Kamyua Yost smiled cheerfully.<br/>
"But in actual fact, the people who work with slaves more, are less likely to treat them harshly. Many landlords reward slaves for their efficient work and even recognize marriage between slaves. Those who treat slaves inhumanely are the minority. And that Pyschkurewuss… belongs to the minority."<br/>
"Why are you telling me this?"<br/>
"Well, after the conference today, I can feel that Pyschkurewuss thinks of the denizens of Forest’s Edge as an important labor force, but not his equal. I have always suspected that, and after seeing his murky eyes when he looks at the denizens of Forest’s Edge, I am now sure of it."<br/>
Kaslan Lutim looked at Kamyua Yost calmly.<br/>
Noticing his gaze, Kamyua Yost smiled casually.<br/>
"There aren’t many people in the Post Station Town who look at the denizens of Forest’s Edge with such disdain. The townsfolk might not think of the Forest’s Edge denizens as fellow citizens, but they don’t think the denizens aren’t people."<br/>
"I still can’t really understand slavery and the conflict between the north and west. But Pyschkurewuss’ eyes feel unsettling to me."<br/>
Kaslan Lutim was still collected, but I was the opposite.<br/>
Ai Fa stood beside me; Kaslan Lutim, Ludo Wu, Leina Wu, and Shela Wu were here too.<br/>
They were all important people to me. To not treat these charming people as humans… That was beyond my comprehension.<br/>
"… And so, even though Asuta is a denizen of Forest’s Edge, your appearance is still that of a westerner. At the very least, you don’t have the features of a Forest’s Edge denizen or someone from the north. Pyschkurewuss might treat Asuta humanely, so I hope you don’t get confused by that."<br/>
"Thank you for telling me this precious information. But… isn’t it possible that I won’t ever meet that Pyschkurewuss?"<br/>
"Yes, I can only pray that won’t ever happen."<br/>
So there was still a chance.<br/>
What a creepy thought.<br/>
I took a deep breath, expelled the miasma in my heart, and faced Kamyua Yost with refreshed emotions.<br/>
"So, what is the request that you got the tribal chiefs to agree to, Kamyua? This is the first thing you asked for something from the Forest’s Edge, correct?"<br/>
"Yes. I don’t have even help this time, so I want them to lend me some men to look for someone."<br/>
"Look for someone?"<br/>
"That’s right. I plan to leave Genos and search in the neighboring cities. The person I’m looking for is a survivor of the ‘Red Beard Gang’. Kaslan Lutim already told you about them, correct?"<br/>
I held my breath.<br/>
What was he planning?<br/>
"Actually, I already made a decision to search for that person. We can figure out what happened to the ‘Red Beard Gang’ ten years ago if the search bears fruit. I want to uncover Pyschkurewuss crimes this way."<br/>
"Wasn’t that bandit gang destroyed a decade ago, with all the members executed?"<br/>
"Yes, but only that person somehow escaped the encirclement by the subjugation team. And she is also someone close to the boss, so she should know what actually happened back then."<br/>
"She? That person is a woman?"<br/>
"Yes. She was the significant other of red beard Goram, the boss of the ‘Red Beard Gang’. She was a great fighter serving as the lieutenant of the boss and stayed home after giving birth. That’s why she wasn’t caught."<br/>
The significant other of the bandit boss… Could they get a useful testimony from someone like that?<br/>
I better let Kamyua Yost be the judge of that. I had something else to ask him.<br/>
"You want the denizens of Forest’s Edge to help in your search? And the tribal chiefs actually agreed?"<br/>
"Yes. Donda Wu and the others feel that if Pyschkurewuss’ wrongdoings aren’t uncovered, the conference won’t progress. Even Graff Zaza feels a suspicious man like me is better than that Pyschkurewuss."<br/>
Kamyua Yost said and smiled like a Cheshire cat.<br/>
"In any case, Malfreed can’t deploy his troops as he wishes, and he can’t leave Genos either. I’m glad you guys can understand our constraints. By the way… the Wu clan loaned me three men, and I’m teaching them how to ride a Totos right now. I plan to ride at dawn."<br/>
Letting the denizens of Forest’s Edge travel outside of Genos on a Totos, what an unexpected development.<br/>
"Tch! That’s so interesting! If I don’t have to guard the stall, I want to go too!"<br/>
Ludo Wu said relaxedly.<br/>
I looked Kamyua Yost in the eyes and said:<br/>
"Kamyua Yost, can we trust you on this?"<br/>
"Yes. Uncovering the wrongdoings of Pyschkurewuss is closely related to a bright future for Forest’s Edge too, correct?"<br/>
The tribal chief of Forest’s Edge, Donda Wu has already agreed to this proposal anyway.<br/>
I could only put my faith in them.<br/>
"I understand. I will await your safe return. Will you be back before the conference…?"<br/>
"Yes. The hunters of the Wu clan have a vacation right now too, so the timing is just right. But… I want to return as soon as possible. I don’t know what Pyschkurewuss is scheming by pushing the conference back for another half a month."<br/>
Kamyua Yost’s purple eyes lighted up clearly.<br/>
"I hope you guys can stay on your guard too, Asuta. Pyschkurewuss didn’t mention your business during today’s conference, which is a surprise. Since Asuta is the one who built a relationship with the Post Station Town, he should be an existence Pyschkurewuss can’t ignore. Well then… I’m looking forward to eating Asuta’s dishes again in a few days time."<br/>
