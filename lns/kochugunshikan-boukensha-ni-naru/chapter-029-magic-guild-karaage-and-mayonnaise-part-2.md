After we finished our business at the Magic Guild, we returned to the inn.<br/>
"So it would be best if we kept your ability to learn magic spells through observation a secret right?"<br/>
"Certainly. I think it will turn out to be troublesome once the Magic Guild finds out."<br/>
"No, it will most certainly cause you a fair bit of trouble. It would definitely cause a major uproar."<br/>
"So it’s really like that huh. That was dangerous. I guess I’ll have to hold back once I take the admission test tomorrow."<br/>
"It’s a bit unfortunate though. If Alan gets serious, I’m sure you’ll easily attain S rank."<br/>
"I’m not really concerned with my Guild ranking anyway. More importantly, what kind of dish do you want me to cook for tonight’s dinner?"<br/>
"I’m fine with anything, but… Oh, right! I want to taste a dish from Alan’s country."<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
"A dish from my country huh. What should I cook then."<br/>
Hm, I guess it’ll have to be Earth recipes, which are all the rage back in the Empire. So a representative Earth dish for chicken meat would be…<br/>
I’ve been thinking up several dishes until we arrived back at the inn.<br/>
I went back to my room and got my condiments and spices ready. I can’t wait to cook again. The kitchen couldn’t house a lot of people, so I had Cleria and Elna wait outside.<br/>
I entered the kitchen and was shown the sliced Black Bird meat by the chef uncle.<br/>
"Thank you very much for preparing the meat for me, sir. My name’s Alan. Nice to meet you."<br/>
"It wasn’t much, kid. The name’s Verse. So what are you going to make anyway?"<br/>
<br/>
"I was thinking of cooking dishes from my country. Wow, these sure are some nice cuts. You really are a pro, sir."<br/>
The meat’s already portioned into parts. He’s also taken out the tendons as well. Oh, and he even got the white liver.<br/>
I’ll check the cooking tools first. The flame magic tool was the same as the one in Tarus-san’s manor. They might have purchased it from Tarus-san’s store actually.<br/>
There was a new refrigerating magic tool as well. Oh, and there’s also a grating device. There are also bowls of different sizes. There’s a frying pan, saucepan, and all other cooking utensils also present in Tarus-san’s kitchen. I see. I think I’ll be able to cook up some great dishes with these.<br/>
The refrigerating magic tool also had a stock of different vegetables inside.<br/>
I checked the spices and condiments next. The stock’s roughly the same as with Tarus-san’s kitchen as well.<br/>
"Whoah! Is this katsuobushi!?"<br/>
"You familiar with that kid? I actually got that from a long-time customer for cheap, but I have no idea how to use it for cooking. That customer also didn’t know as well. It seems it was an unsold item of his. Since I felt it was a shame not to use it, I sometimes take some shavings and sprinkle it on top of some dishes."<br/>
I scraped some with a knife and gave it a taste. Yup, it looked a bit different, but this is definitely katsuobushi.<br/>
"Well, I do have an idea about how to use this. I’m familiar with a cooking method that can bring out more of its umami as well. Do you have more of this stuff?"<br/>
"I have one box filled with the stuff."<br/>
"Great! Can I get some from you later? I’ll pay for it of course."<br/>
"I don’t really mind, but…"<br/>
"Can I also use some of your vegetables and eggs?"<br/>
"Do what you want. It’s your food tonight anyway."<br/>
"I see. I’ll take you up on that then."<br/>
"Since I’m free anyway, want me to help out as well?"<br/>
"Well, can you shave off some of this katsuobushi then? The thinner, the better."<br/>
"That’s easy, kid."<br/>
"Oh, do you want me to cook some portions for your family as well, Verse? You still haven’t had dinner, right?"<br/>
"Fine. If it’s tasty, that is. My girls are quite picky about their food after all."<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
"Great, leave it to me then."<br/>
After seeing this katsuobushi, I decided on tonight’s menu. It was a recipe from the place called Japan on Earth.<br/>
I decided to cook thigh meat karaage, fried chicken tenderloin, white liver sashimi, and white rice. If I still have time, I’ll also whip up some chicken oyakodonburi as well. I’ll feel sorry for Elna if I just cook meat dishes, so I’ll make some salad too. And I’ll make some bonito-flavored soup stock as well.<br/>
I’ll prepare the meat for karaage first.<br/>
I sliced the thigh meat into bite-sized pieces and put them inside a bowl. I’ll use all of the meat available! We’ll just eat some for breakfast if there are any leftovers later. That’s a lot of meat.<br/>
I grated some mock-ginger and placed it on a small bowl. I also did the same for the mock-garlic. I then put the grated ingredients inside the bowl with the chicken meat. It’s my personal style to put in lots of garlic.<br/>
I then took out the soy sauce I bought. I didn’t manage to find it in this kitchen, so I guess it was lucky that I bought some.<br/>
"What’s that?"<br/>
"It’s a seasoning called Soy. You’re familiar with the Tarus General Store, right? I got it from there. Do you want to have a taste?"<br/>
I poured some Soy into a small dish and offered it to Verse.<br/>
"It has a deep flavor to it. I’ll buy some as well."<br/>
"It’s quite expensive by the way. This small cask already costs one large silver coin. Oh, that kind of thickness is fine by the way."<br/>
"It’s really costly huh. I’ll think about it first then."<br/>
I mixed the seasonings and the thigh meat well, and let it sit for a bit. I actually wanted to put in some cooking sake as well, but unfortunately, I wasn’t able to find any. I pierced the portions with a fork so the flavor of the seasonings can permeate the meat better.<br/>
Since the katsuobushi shavings have been prepared, I’ll start on making the stock.<br/>
I poured water inside a pot and put it over the fire. While waiting for it to boil, I prepared some bread crumbs. The leftovers yesterday have already hardened nicely so they were ready for use.<br/>
"Can you grate this bread and put it on a separate bowl for me?"<br/>
"What’re you going to use this stuff for?"<br/>
"Well, just watch me."<br/>
I got the breast meat and sliced them for making the fried chicken tenders. There’s a lot of breast meat as well. I also put the meat inside a bowl along with some grated garlic and soy sauce marinade. I’m going to pair it with tartar sauce later, so I adjusted the flavor to be milder compared to the thigh meat.<br/>
The water inside the pot already came to a boil, so I put in the sliced katsuobushi. The point is not to boil the water too much.<br/>
I’ll make some mayonnaise next. Oops. I’ll have to make sure the eggs are safe to be eaten raw first. I took an egg and cracked it open. The insides looked like the eggs I usually buy in the market back in the Empire. I found an egg beater as well, so I whisked the raw egg for a bit and dipped my fingers into it so I can make Nanom check it out.<br/>
「Possible to eat raw.」<br/>
Great, no problems there.<br/>
Whoops, it looks like the soup is done. I took out a strainer and poured out the broth inside another pot. I sampled it with a small dish. It turned out into quite a tasty soup.<br/>
"I managed to extract the umami. Have a taste."<br/>
I offered a portion to Verse as well.<br/>
"This-!? You managed to get this flavor just by boiling it in water?"<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
"I’ll do some additional flavoring later as well."<br/>
I’ll continue with making the mayonnaise. First I’ll get some eggs, sugar, salt, vinegar, and powdered herbs. I put them all inside a large bowl and started mixing them. I’ll make a lot since I’m also going to need some for making tartar sauce.<br/>
I put in portions of oil little by little and mixed it well. I mixed the stuff up until the arm enhanced by Nanom started to feel numb and finally finished making it.<br/>
I could create it barehanded since it’s me, but normal people would need a mixer for this, I think. But it looks like there was no magic tool resembling a mixer available yet. I’ll ask about it tomorrow.<br/>
Delicious! Handmade mayonnaise really does taste different.<br/>
I also had Verse taste some.<br/>
"This stuff’s great! What the heck is this sauce!?"<br/>
"Right? This is also quite popular back in my home country. It’s great paired with both meat and vegetables."<br/>
Oops, I’ll need to boil some eggs for use with the tartar sauce later as well.<br/>
Alright, I’ll finish preparing the soup then. I found some mushrooms resembling shiitake inside the magic fridge earlier, so I’ll make a simple mushroom broth. I want to emphasize the broth itself, and not the ingredients.<br/>
