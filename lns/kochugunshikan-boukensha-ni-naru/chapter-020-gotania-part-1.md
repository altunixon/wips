Chapter 19: Escort 2 (Part 3)<br/>
Chapter 20: Gotania (Part 2)<br/>

 Translator: SFBaka <br/>
<br/>
The number of people traveling on the road increased as we neared Gotania.<br/>
We encountered one or two groups every hour or so and we were getting lots of attention because of the long line of captives bound to our carriage. Some of them even purposely called out to ask if the captives we were towing were bandits, to which I answered in the affirmative.<br/>
Beck and Thor were out front on the driver’s seat while I, Cleria and Tarus-san sat on top of the luggage. Cleria sat at the very back so she could keep her eyes on the captured bandits.<br/>
I was relatively free so I asked Tarus-san a lot of things I was curious about.<br/>
Gotania was apparently a big city with a population of about 20,000, and achieved prosperity through being a center of trade and commerce in the Belta Kingdom.<br/>
"Do we need some sort of permit for entering the city?"<br/>
"Is Alan-san not affiliated with any guild?"<br/>
I’ve heard about guilds from Beck and the rest. They were organizations that officially registered people of different trades such as adventurers and merchants. There were different kinds such as the adventurers guild and the merchant guild. Beck and Thor were apparently registered members of the merchant guild.<br/>
"No, I haven’t registered in one yet."<br/>
"If you were a guild member, your guild certificate would serve as your pass. If you aren’t registered to any, you need to pay a fee and be issued a temporary pass instead.<br/>
"How much do I need to pay?"<br/>
"Well, it’s just one silver per person. And if you were to enter a guild within a five day period, the money will be refunded to you in full."<br/>
I see. It was actually quite a fair policy.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
"Do you need money to enter a guild?"<br/>
"Are you aiming to register at the adventurers guild, Alan-san? If my memory serves me right, it would cost you five silver coins."<br/>
It looks like entering the city would pose no problem after all.<br/>
"How much does it cost to stay overnight at an inn?"<br/>
"The price varies depending on the establishment. It would cost four large bronze coins to stay at relatively cheaper ones, one silver coin for regular inns and up to five silver coins if you choose to stay at a luxury hotel."<br/>
"Are there inns with baths available?"<br/>
"You can only find baths at high-class inns. Regular ones wouldn’t have them, I’m afraid."<br/>
Well, I think I’ve managed to grasp a general idea of the market price. So it costs five silvers for an inn with baths huh. You can stay for twenty days with one gold coin. Looks like booking an inn wouldn’t cause Cleria and I any trouble for the time being as well.<br/>
"Would it be fine for you to head over to my mansion tonight? You can bring everyone else with you, of course."<br/>
"Eh? But…"<br/>
"Please. I owe everyone my life. You’ve also meted out justice on behalf of my slain employee and adventurer cohorts. I would very much like to express my gratitude today if you’d allow me the honor."<br/>
It would be rude of me to refuse after the other party had said this much.<br/>
"I understand. We’ll be in your care then."<br/>
"Thank you very much. My mansion has a nice, large bath. I will also tell my chefs to prepare a nice dinner for all of you."<br/>
Alright! I’m now really looking forward to this.<br/>
"Beck! We’ll go stay at Tarus-san’s mansion tonight. It seems he’ll treat us."<br/>
"Yeah!" Beck and Thor exclaimed in glee.<br/>
We finally managed to see the city of Gotania at around four in the afternoon. The entire city was surrounded by ten meter high walls. I zoomed in. The wall looks like it was made by stacking lots of reddish-brown bricks. There was one huge main gate that looked like it could fit two carriages side by side during entry. It was certainly a large city.<br/>
We finally arrived in front of the gate after about twenty minutes. It didn’t take long for our turn to enter the city. Two men wearing leather armor and wielding spears approached us. It looks like they were part of the city guards. The three of us who were sitting on top of the luggage went down and met up with them.<br/>
"Oi, oi. That’s quite a number you got there. These guys bandits? You managed to catch these suckers by yourselves?"<br/>
He sure was quite blunt for a soldier.<br/>
"Good afternoon, Captain Roman."<br/>
"Well now! If it isn’t Tarus-san? I’m sorry, I didn’t manage to notice you earlier. Why are you riding in this carriage!?"<br/>
"My convoy was attacked by those bandits over there. Tim and the adventurers escorting us were all killed. I was probably kept alive so they could exchange me for a hefty ransom."<br/>
"My word! That certainly is unfortunate. Please, go ahead and rest up a bit at the guard station. Oh right. This young man has been waiting at the gates for Tarus-san for the last three days."<br/>
When we looked toward the gate, we saw a boy who looked to be about thirteen years old running up to us.<br/>
"Master! Masteeer! You’re alright! Ah, thank goodness!"<br/>
Looks like Tarus-san was really well-liked.<br/>
"Ah, Willy. I’m sorry to have made you worry. I trust the store hasn’t encountered any problems while I was gone?"<br/>
"I don’t think it did, but everyone was sick with worry."<br/>
"I see. It’s fine now. It’s good that you’re here. Please tell everyone to prepare a grand welcome for these four individuals. I owe them my life and would like to express my utmost gratitude."<br/>
"Understood!"<br/>
The boy ran back inside the city at full-speed.<br/>
We were led inside the city guard garrison and were served some tea. Un, they’re really treating us like VIPs.<br/>
We dealt with the necessary procedures soon after. Beck and Thor were members of the merchant guild so they didn’t have any problems entering. I and Cleria, on the other hand, had to pay a two silver deposit and were issued some temporary passes. The passes were thin wooden plates with words written on them.<br/>
"Well then, about these bandits you caught. We will record your merits here. However, the reward money will be sent after two days. You two will have to return here after two days to claim the money."<br/>
"Understood. Thank you very much."<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Yosh, we’ve managed to solve our money troubles, more or less.<br/>
After we left the guard station, we immediately headed for Tarus-san’s mansion. A regal-looking carriage was parked in front of the station with a person who seemed to be a butler waiting at the side.<br/>
"I have come to receive you, Master."<br/>
"Oh, thank you Jonas. I have troubled you." Tarus-san replied.<br/>
"Alan-san, Miss Ria, please go ahead and board this carriage. It would feel better than riding a carriage meant for transporting goods, I reckon."<br/>
"I see. Follow this carriage then, Beck."<br/>
The cityscape of Gotania was apparently made of the same reddish-brown bricks as the city-wall. There was a sense of harmony about it and made for a beautiful sight. Evening was about to arrive and there were a lot of people milling about the city streets. There were all sorts of people; from housewives coming home from shopping to young men eating out at a roadside stall. Man, I’d like to try eating at those stalls as well.<br/>
The people got surprised whenever the carriage passed by and hurriedly made way. Well, they may just be avoiding it because its a large carriage and they don’t want to get caught in an accident. But it does seem Tarus-san held quite an influence in the city based on the attitude of those city guards earlier. Looks like I really lucked out by managing to rescue such a person.<br/>
I could probably rely on Tarus-san if I ever got into trouble in this city.<br/>
The atmosphere of the surroundings soon changed, and we arrived at a luxurious-looking residential area. The carriage stopped in front of the largest mansion in the area.<br/>
People who seemed to be employees were lined up on each side of the front gate. Tarus-san got off the carriage.<br/>
""Welcome home, Master!""<br/>
"Umu, I have made you all worry, everyone."<br/>
There were actually people shedding tears of joy among the employees. He really was well-loved.<br/>
I, Cleria, Beck and Thor also got off the carriage. Man, this really feels quite grand.<br/>
"Everyone, these people are my saviors. I owe them my life. They are Alan-san, Miss Ria, Beck-kun and Thor-kun. Do give them the warmest welcome."<br/>
""Yes!""<br/>
"Everyone, please go ahead and come inside."<br/>
The butler guy, Jonas-san, respectfully led us in.<br/>
"Well then, how about taking them to the baths first in order for them to refresh themselves?" Tarus-san suggested.<br/>
"Understood. Please follow me, everyone."<br/>
Jonas-san led the way.<br/>
"How about you enter first, Ria?" Ladies first, as the saying goes.<br/>
"Oh, there is more than one bath, so that would not be necessary," Jonas-san informed.<br/>
"Please follow me, Miss Ria."<br/>
A young female employee appeared and guided Cleria.<br/>
Oh man. Looks like Tarus-san was really loaded. Just how many baths does this mansion have? Amazing.<br/>
"This is the bath area. Um, please pardon me if this sounds rude, but do you know the proper way to enter?"<br/>
"You need to wash yourself clean first before entering, right?"<br/>
I managed to watch a documentary produced on Earth called [Hot Springs 101] on the holobit once. This looks to be the same type as the hot springs over there.<br/>
"That’s exactly the case. Do pardon my earlier presumptuousness. Well then, please take your time and enjoy."<br/>
We found a dressing room once we went inside. A large wooden hot water bath that looked able to fit ten people at once could be seen further in.<br/>
"It’s our first time to enter into this sort of fancy bath, Alan-san."<br/>
Beck and Thor looked rather nervous.<br/>
"Well, basically, you just need to wash yourselves clean and enter the hot water bath afterward."<br/>
It’s been a long time since I’ve gotten a chance to properly wash my body.<br/>
I left my clothes at the dressing room and went towards the bath area. Beck and Thor hurriedly followed suit.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
"First, you need to draw water using this wooden pail and drench yourselves with it. Then draw some water again and use this. This is a cloth used to wipe your body clean. Oh, they even have this!"<br/>
This seems to be a substitute for body soap. I forgot its name but I also saw them using it in the documentary.<br/>
"Drench this cloth and then rub it on this rock-like item until foam forms on it."<br/>
Beck and Thor frantically copied my actions.<br/>
"After it foams up, you then use this cloth to wipe your bodies clean. You also need to use this rock-like item to clean your hair."<br/>
We soon found ourselves busy with washing up. Beck and Thor seem to be enjoying themselves quite a bit. It felt like ages since I got to clean my body up like this.<br/>
"Then you need to splash yourselves with water once more to remove the foam."<br/>
I drew water inside the pail again and used it to wash the foam off.<br/>
"After that, we can finally enjoy immersing ourselves in the hot water bath."<br/>
I slowly entered the bath. The water had the perfect temperature.<br/>
Fuu, that feels good. Having a quick shower pales in comparison.<br/>
"Baths are really great, aren’t they, Alan-san?"<br/>
Thor nodded in agreement at Beck’s statement.<br/>
"Yeah, they’re the best."<br/>
We thoroughly enjoyed the hot water bath.<br/>
