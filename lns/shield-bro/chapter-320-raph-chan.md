<br/>
Raph-chan’s gender is unknown, because he/she is always referred to in a gender-neutral fashion.<br/>
Chapter 320: Raph-chan<br/>
"Then what sort of ability do these children possess?" (Trash)<br/>
I turn my eyes to Rat.<br/>
"Their individual powers are all over the place. But… each one specializes in Illusion Magic." (Rat)<br/>
Well they were modeled after Raphtalia.<br/>
And her specialty is illusions.<br/>
The specific category is apparently light and darkness, but she can become invisible, and affect enemy perception to lead them astray.<br/>
Raphtalia herself doesn’t use magic too much, though. She mainly focuses on sword skills.<br/>
"Users of Illusion Magic… I think I’ll be able to use them. And it looks like I can also depend on their strength." (Trash)<br/>
"By the way, Marquis, about this child." (Rat)<br/>
"What about him?" (Naofumi)<br/>
She speaks while pointing to Raph-chan.<br/>
"From what I see, that one seems a little different from the rest, but do you know anything about that?" (Rat)<br/>
"I’m not that knowledgeable either. He was hidden on the bottom of my carriage when we were going to Faubley. His level is also quiet high." (Naofumi)<br/>
I look over his stats again.<br/>
… Why has it risen? It’s 90 now.<br/>
"Can I give it a quick examination? I don’t think it’ll let me hold it." (Rat)<br/>
"Sure. Stay still for a bit." (Naofumi)<br/>
"Rafu~?" (Raph-chan)<br/>
Rat begins performing light pulpations on Raph-chan.<br/>
"Its fur, and its reaction to magic is different than the rest. I guess I should compare it to a Filo Rial’s mutation to royalty." (Rat)<br/>
"Mutation, like Firo." (Naofumi)<br/>
So something influenced one of the Raphs I knew, and caused it to undergo a drastic change?<br/>
"What exactly is he?" (Naofumi)<br/>
"No idea…" (Rat)<br/>
"Hey, where did you come from?" (Naofumi)<br/>
"Rafu~." (Raph-chan)<br/>
He points in the direction of the sea.<br/>
In that direction is Sadina’s secret base.<br/>
No, I understand that that’s where you were made, but…<br/>
"It gives a proper response when asked. It seems quite smart." (Rat)<br/>
"Can you understand what it’s trying to tell us?" (Naofumi)<br/>
"I can understand Mii-kun, and a portion of the monsters, but the Raphs you made purely from scratch are incomprehensible to me." (Rat)<br/>
"Rafu~." (Raph)<br/>
Raph-chan’s making various gestures to illustrate its origin, but I don’t believe the message is getting through.<br/>
However, I do hope that he never learns to speak like the Filo Rials.<br/>
"Well, it doesn’t really matter. Can you do anything special? Are you the same as the rest? Is there a reason that you could use barrier magic back there?" (Naofumi)<br/>
I try asking.<br/>
Raph-chan tilts its head to one side, and begins thinking. He stands up on his hind legs, and crosses his front ones.<br/>
Uwah. That pose is cute.<br/>
Unlike a certain bird, he’s not showing an excess amount of pushiness.<br/>
"Rafu~." (Raph-chan)<br/>
For some reason, Raph-chan points to Raphtalia, and starts walking towards her.<br/>
"Me?" (Raphtalia)<br/>
As he approaches, he swells his tail, and begins activating a skill.<br/>
All of the fur on its body stands on end…<br/>
With a poof… he transformed.<br/>
"Wha-"<br/>
Standing there, was a Raphtalia, much like she was when I first met her.<br/>
How nostalgic.<br/>
I had forgotten that she looked like this.<br/>
"Rafu~!" (Raph-chan)<br/>
Raph-chan raises both of his arms, as if to ask me to praise him…<br/>
But that’s not the problem.<br/>
"Why are you naked!?" (Naofumi)<br/>
I avert my gaze.<br/>
"Is this a form of illusion magic?" (Rat)<br/>
Rat covers Raph-chan’s body with her lab-coat. Raphtalia begins calming her down.<br/>
"For now, learn how to wear clothes, and how to walk around in them." (Naofumi)<br/>
"Rafu~?" (Raph-chan)<br/>
Smoke surrounds her body, and clothes much like the ones Raphtalia is currently wearing appear.<br/>
Is this also an illusion?<br/>
Rat tries touching Raph-chan’s face.<br/>
"Let’s see. Is this an illusion so advanced that it can even deceive the sense of touch?" (Rat)<br/>
"Rafu~…" (Raph-chan)<br/>
As Rat continually pokes her body, Raph-chan lets out a sound indicating her dislike of it.<br/>
"Amazing. It’s as if she’s really there." (Rat)<br/>
"Rafu~!" (Raph-chan)<br/>
The mystery has deepened!<br/>
Just who is Raph-chan supposed to be?<br/>
His specs are much higher than any of the Raphs I know.<br/>
Rat may be correct in saying he’s a special variant like Firo.<br/>
"Ara? The quality of the clothing illusion isn’t that high. It’s as if I’m touching his skin." (Rat)<br/>
"Rafu~." (Raph-chan)<br/>
It looks like it tickles. Raph-chan in Raphtalia (Little Girl) form runs, and hides behind me.<br/>
"Arara, he ran away." (Rat)<br/>
"Rafu~." (Raph-chan)<br/>
"Do you have any other abilities?" (Naofumi)<br/>
Raph-chan looks at Raphtalia again.<br/>
"I don’t know why, but I’m getting a bad feeling about this…" (Raphtalia)<br/>
"Rafu~." (Raph-chan)<br/>
This time, she transforms to be identical to Raphtalia.<br/>
Amazing. His height and posture are identical to hers.<br/>
"Rafu~?" (Raph-chan)<br/>
I get the feeling that Raph-chan’s form is a bit less defined than hers.<br/>
Well, Tanukis are supposed to be good at transforming, so perhaps this is supposed to be normal.<br/>
But I don’t really like him taking on human form.<br/>
As if he had read my mind, Raph-chan changes back to Raph form.<br/>
Good boy. Unlike a certain bird over there, he can read the mood.<br/>
"So you can change into various things?" (Naofumi)<br/>
"Rafu~." (Raph-chan)<br/>
He gives a firm nod.<br/>
"I bet he’s making it look lilke that with magic." (Rat)<br/>
Raph-chan turns his head, as if to deny the claim.<br/>
"Eh? Then you can actually transform?" (Naofumi)<br/>
Raph-chan shakes his head up and down.<br/>
Ku… that’s right. The other me conducted strange experiments to try to reproduce Raphtalia.<br/>
So Raph-chan might actually have the ability to become her.<br/>
If he also got the ability to talk, it would be the birth of a new type of Filo Rial.<br/>
… What is it? I have a really bad premonition.<br/>
I get the feeling that they’re going to be revered as divine beasts in the future.<br/>
"Rafu~." (Raph-chan)<br/>
Raph-chan sticks out his chest with pride, but I really hope he continues speaking like that.<br/>
"Anything else?" (Naofumi)<br/>
"Rafu~?" (Raph-chan)<br/>
On my request, Raph-chan begins thinking again.<br/>
"Can you grow like Mii-kun?" (Rat)<br/>
"Don’t put in impossible requests." (Naofumi)<br/>
"Rafu~!" (Raph-chan)<br/>
On Rat’s inquiry, Raph-chan transformed.<br/>
Oy… he turned into a bear-like Raph.<br/>
I think I saw a Raph like that in the village.<br/>
"Rafu~." (Raph-chan)<br/>
To put it clearly, he did not have any slime-like functions like Mii-kun. Raph-chan continued to gesture.<br/>
"Hmm…" (Naofumi)<br/>
I feel that I would be able to ride his back.<br/>
I actually like this one better.<br/>
If Firo stopped talking, I feel that I would be able to lean on her, and take a nice nap. Now this one can take that role.<br/>
This form looks like your friendly neighborhood youkai. (TL: Specifically, a certain Totoro)<br/>
At least, he gives off a feeling like that.<br/>
"How versatile." (Rat)<br/>
"Right." (Naofumi)<br/>
"Rafu~." (Raph-chan)<br/>
"…" (Raphtalia)<br/>
Raphtalia has a strange expression, and she hangs her head.<br/>
I mean, this monster was modelled after her, and heavily modified.<br/>
I kinda understand her feelings, but I don’t hate this Raph.<br/>
"It seems he has quite a few abilities." (Trash)<br/>
Trash, who had been quiet up until now, spoke up.<br/>
"Yep." (Naofumi)<br/>
"Then would he be able to do something like this as well?" (Trash)<br/>
Trash offers a proposal to Raph-chan. I was also in agreement with the contents.<br/>
If all goes well, Raphtalia and Raph-chan will become significant players in this battle.<br/>
The problem is that that Raphtalia’s expression seemed doubtful on hearing the plan.<br/>
If I were to be put in Raphtalia’s place, I think I would feel the same.<br/>
No, since Raph-chan is good with illusions, perhaps I can take her place.<br/>
"Are we really doing that?" (Raphtalia)<br/>
"If we succeed, won’t it be useful?" (Naofumi)<br/>
"Well, that’s true." (Raphtalia)<br/>
"Rafu~." (Raph-can)<br/>
This Raph doesn’t seem to call Rahtalia a fake.<br/>
Though he sometimes seem to come close to saying it.<br/>
After we practiced executing the plan, and managed to pull it off easily, Raphtalia’s expression became even more depressed.<br/>
If we had just done it without practice, it probably would have been fine.<br/>
"Next is my village’s fighting power. If you need anything built for the war, my Lemos should be able to make them." (Naofumi)<br/>
I would put in a request to Imya and her uncle.<br/>
They’re skillful, and they’re trustful of me.<br/>
"If we get them to work with those at the castle… understood. Iwatani-dono, your forces will be taken into account." (Trash)<br/>
"That helps. We’re all counting on your strategy." (Naofumi)<br/>
"Leave it to me. Then after seeing your available combatants, let’s go to the castle once more, and put our ideas together." (Trash)<br/>
"Yeah." (Naofumi)<br/>
Like that, Trash began selecting forces from my village to participate in the war.<br/>
Since we would be fighting humans, Trash said that there were quite a few people who shouldn’t participate even if they wanted to.<br/>
Since they did wish it, I went through some trouble calming them down.<br/>
But just as Trash said, many of their hands shook when it came down to it.<br/>
They’re fine with fighting monsters, but many people understood that they didn’t have it in them to commit murder.<br/>
And I once again had to sooth the ones who couldn’t go to war.<br/>
Looking at statistics, a large portion of our forces were unable to participate.<br/>
The ratio of women in out village was high to begin with.<br/>
And while the night was drawing on, we used Ren to return to the castle.<br/>
