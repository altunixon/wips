Thank you, everyone, for reading the first volume of "Cooking with Wild Game".<br/>
I’m the author EDA, pronounced "Ehh Daa"; I hope everyone can remember me.<br/>
I started uploading this novel to the website "Become a Novelist"[30] in August 2014. This afterword is written in January 2015. I’m still looking from the edge of the forest towards the end of this story in the distance, and I hope everyone can continue to support me online.<br/>
Thanks to everyone who have supported me since I started posting, this book gets to be published, and I’m very honored. I’m thankful to everyone from the bottom of my heart.<br/>
I put in a lot of effort for the sake of the old readers who supported me and the new readers who purchased my book; what do you think about it? I hope this book suits your taste.<br/>
The protagonist who found himself in a different world gets to know the people in that world through his culinary skills! After this inspiration struck, I started writing this story. The story is developing according to my draft mostly, but there are times when it differs in small ways. Some characters shine unexpectedly, while other important characters get relegated to the background, making the project even more interesting.<br/>
I told myself that ‘such uncertain factors bring more life to the story!’ and wrote relentlessly every day. What will happen to Asuta, Ai Fa, and the various characters? I’m worried and watch over them, but this is also an enjoyable experience. If you share the same joy as me when reading it, I will feel really happy too.<br/>
Finally, I want to thank my editor from Hobby Japan, the illustrator who drew the wonderful pictures, and everyone who worked on the publishing of this book. Once again, thank you, everyone, who bought this book. I will be stopping here.<br/>
See you next volume!<br/>
January 2015, EDA<br/>
