Chapter 363: The Power to Protect Everything<br/>
And I continued walking down the dark path.<br/>
Luckily, it seemed that proceeding down it was possible in itself.<br/>
On the way… I’m occasionally forced to take a break before I walk again, further, and further.<br/>
Eventually, various worlds start passing me by.<br/>
Honestly, I remember hallucinating that I was lost.<br/>
Sometimes I found myself in a desert, or a forest… This really is the gap that connects worlds.<br/>
But I never met anything, be it monster, animal, or human.<br/>
A place without the breath of life… I guess.<br/>
I often found my legs sprained and bruised.<br/>
But in order to reach that world in the sky I… walked on.<br/>
In that world, there’s Raphtalia. There’s everyone.<br/>
I decided to protect it.<br/>
Even if I crumble away while seeking my goal, I will…<br/>
The Four Holy Weapons’ Manual was in my hand.<br/>
I would regularly open it, and check for changes.<br/>
But the story isn’t proceeding.<br/>
Many times, I thought there would be no point, but I decided not to give up.<br/>
As I continued walking, quite a bit of time passed.<br/>
Was it a day, or a week or a month, or even more?<br/>
My sense of time is really dull here.<br/>
And in the world of the rift, I can’t really feel hunger.<br/>
In the desert, I was given the sensation of being so hungry I would keel over, and so thirsty I would wither away.<br/>
But still, I overcame it.<br/>
I get the feeling I’ve been walking for quite a long time, but still I have yet to reach it.<br/>
My body is telling me I’ve already walked the circumference of the world, but that’s probably an exaggeration.<br/>
It’s usually quite dark, so I really can’t tell.<br/>
But without the need for sleep, only fatigue piles onto itself.<br/>
I forgot that Arc was probably something similar to that Bitch Goddess.<br/>
For a human like me, there’s a great difference in our sense of time.<br/>
When I look in the sky, I see worlds other than the one I’m venturing to sticking to one another.<br/>
Is that… World Assimilation?<br/>
It really is like two soap bubbles.<br/>
My Hair is growing like crazy. Really, just how much time has passed?<br/>
But I don’t stop moving forward. I don’t plan on stopping.<br/>
I was sick of it when I wandered into a labyrinth-like world.<br/>
I wasn’t able to proceed in the direction I wanted to go.<br/>
This isn’t getting anywhere.<br/>
Occasionally, I see shooting stars collide with the worlds in the sky.<br/>
I wonder what those are.<br/>
I’ve started to lose a sense for just how far I’ve walked.<br/>
The scenery that remains constant for eternity, I’m sick of looking at the sky above me.<br/>
At that point, I was only walking by resolve alone.<br/>
It was around that time that my head started to go strange.<br/>
I began to hear voices.<br/>
If I turn around, I can immediately go to the world I came from.<br/>
I can forget everything, and write everything off as a dream. A voice whispered this in my ear.<br/>
But, I am… not going to stop proceeding.<br/>
I mean, I wasn’t able to run away.<br/>
There are people who believe in me.<br/>
There are people who depend on me.<br/>
There are people who want to get stronger for my sake.<br/>
And for those people, what can I do?<br/>
I can only use up my body to protect them.<br/>
I don’t intend to go out in that unreasonable way.<br/>
I started thinking as I walked.<br/>
I began to imagine how I would be able to combat that Bitch of a Goddess more efficiently.<br/>
At the start, I couldn’t get the slightest grasp of what to do, but if Arc’s words are true, then it’s not impossible.<br/>
The 0 Series can inflict damage.<br/>
Similarly, the Shield of 0 can endure hers.<br/>
Well my defenses were breached.<br/>
The order of the world?<br/>
Then let’s just rely on the order of another.<br/>
As I walk, I approach the problem again and again.<br/>
Just how can I get the order of the world to rest in my body?<br/>
I remember the concept of magic.<br/>
Magic is created in one’s self.<br/>
If it’s merely a manifestation of the power within, then I need to make it more efficient, so that it can help just a little bit more…. Just one step closer. I want the power to defeat Medea.<br/>
My disposition is for Healing and Support. The Shield interfered, but it’s still the same.<br/>
Then let’s wring out that nature.<br/>
Let’s refine the magic within me to its limits, and create one that can combat her.<br/>
Those thoughts eternally… until I began losing sense of myself, they continued circling around my head, and I remembered the Dragon Pulse Order.<br/>
Revelation was a mixture.<br/>
The Dragon Pulse Order manipulates the power outside.<br/>
With it… based on how you approach it, it’s like… borrowing power from the world.<br/>
What if I change the borrowing to theft, and abuse it as power of my own. Isn’t that how Medea’s rules work?<br/>
That’s why I’ll place importance in the borrowing part.<br/>
Luckily, here I’m able to accomplish that.<br/>
In the worlds I stopped by, I began polishing the Dragon Pulse Law.<br/>
Eventually… I worked out a way to release my own magic outside, and take the pulse within.<br/>
I searched for a way to borrow the world’s power, and fight.<br/>
In order to fill up your empty body, you borrow power from your surroundings.<br/>
While I was thinking about it, I felt the sensation of myself mixing with the world.<br/>
There’s still a way. Let me… grasp the nature of this.<br/>
When there’s nothing to do but walk, you really do think.<br/>
My body’s sense of time sure is strange.<br/>
It feels like… I’ve been walking for years and years, but it also feels like it’s only been a night.<br/>
As I think that… by the time I passed the next world, I felt something spill out from within me.<br/>
The next moment, I lost my voice.<br/>
"Wha–"<br/>
There… was the familiar village I revived.<br/>
But no one was there. It had completely been abandoned.<br/>
"Oy! Is there anyone here!?"<br/>
I’ve returned. As I think that, I search through the village’s buildings.<br/>
But there wasn’t a single soul anywhere.<br/>
Could it be… the world has already fallen to ruin!?<br/>
A black emotion welled up in my heart.<br/>
But my desire to deny it calls out to my rationality.<br/>
They must have just changed base due to the war.<br/>
Yes, that’s right. That must be it.<br/>
And I entered what was once my house.<br/>
As I thought… it isn’t much different from how I remember it. My house.<br/>
…. What’s happened?<br/>
Did I not return?<br/>
I leave the house, and look into the sky again.<br/>
In it, a vast array of worlds was still spread out.<br/>
I’m still within the rift.<br/>
… I can’t give up.<br/>
No matter what happens… I decided never to give up.<br/>
I’m going to reunite with Raphtalia.<br/>
And with everyone.<br/>
Law of cause and effect, was it?<br/>
In the worst case, even if the Shield lends me power, will she be able to tamper with it to do unreasonable things?<br/>
Thinking back, wasn’t her attack based on that concept in the first place?<br/>
Then the changes my Shield carried out in my world were of a similar suit.<br/>
I can’t use the Shield forcefully like she does. Or perhaps I don’t have enough power.<br/>
I continue walking.<br/>
And I arrived at yet another world.<br/>
It was an infinitely expanding one-way staircase.<br/>
The place I just saw earlier was my own hallucination.<br/>
Then I’ll just keep on climbing.<br/>
And in that time, I tried to polish my own skills as much as possible. Little by little.<br/>
And… eventually, I was unable to tell the difference between magic from the outside or inside.<br/>
"Good job getting all the way here."<br/>
At the top of the staircase, Arc was sitting as if he was waiting for me.<br/>
"Just a little longer, and you’ll reach it. A normal person wouldn’t be able to make it here."<br/>
"Back there, I was a village I knew of." (Naofumi)<br/>
"Right… that was a place you made with your own power, a place embedded in your memory, I think. Perhaps it was the shape created by your strong desire to return to that place? I mean, you have yet to reach the world you want to go to."<br/>
"Take me already." (Naofumi)<br/>
"When you’re this close, I don’t see the need to. It’s right before your eyes."<br/>
"Muu…" (Naofumi)<br/>
… So that was something I created with magic.<br/>
Somehow, I get the feeling I’ve grasped something.<br/>
"Then I’ll be going on ahead."<br/>
The agile Arc ran ahead of me on the path.<br/>
I tried chasing him, but I couldn’t keep up.<br/>
Just what sort of logic does this place run on?<br/>
The next place I found myself in was Fitoria’s ruins.<br/>
It’s a place I’ve come to once before. It’s nowhere unknown to me.<br/>
I tried to ignore it, and proceed, but I couldn’t get through the Forest of Illusions.<br/>
So I reluctantly proceeded through the ruins.<br/>
Eventually… I reached the stone house that that bottle was housed in.<br/>
"You’ve reached the goal. For you to be able to come all the way here, your resolve is truly something."<br/>
"Yeah, yeah, yeah. Just let me go on." (Naofumi)<br/>
"Calm down."<br/>
Inside the house, the bottle still hangs.<br/>
"Have you heard anything about this bottle from the child who was keeping it?"<br/>
"Um… there was a bit of personal opinion added, but she did talk about it." (Naofumi)<br/>
"At that time, the Hero said, ‘the first sip is eternal pain, the second, eternal solitude, and the third… a dreadful end.’"<br/>
Was it?<br/>
"Having listened to me, does it sound familiar?"<br/>
"A little." (Naofumi)<br/>
I mean, there was that annoying word, ‘eternal’, mixed in.<br/>
"The first sip will give you everlasting pain, and the second will give you an immortal body to watch those around you die for eternity."<br/>
"The third was a dreadful end, right?" (Naofumi)<br/>
"This is, you see… The Elixir, Amrita, the Eternal Peach, Soma, Tajiku Nakaku. All of them are medicines of immortality. Well, it’s something like that."<br/>
(TL Tajiku Nakaku is a mystical tree in ancient Japanese Legend whose fruit is said to give eternal youth. It is pursued by Tajimamori)<br/>
"Why something like that? She didn’t speak a word of it." (Naofumi)<br/>
"I think it was a promise. Or else she would have been treated as an existence that threatened the world."<br/>
"I see." (Naofumi)<br/>
She may be a dim bird, but she’s one who honors her promises I guess.<br/>
Thinking about it, she was an existence that opposed the near-immortal Dragon Emperor, so she had to have been something like that.<br/>
"Dragons have a different role. I’m tolerating their actions for now."<br/>
"I see." (Naofumi)<br/>
"And I might add, in that world this medicine has been diluted several hundreds of times. Its effects are low. There are rules, you know."<br/>
"Rules, you say." (Naofumi)<br/>
"Looking at immortal beings, what do you think?"<br/>
"That’s unfair." (Naofumi)<br/>
"Right. In this world, it’s against the rules, right? If possible, I would like to have the heroes kill her."<br/>
I see…<br/>
"This is the undiluted form. If you take three sips of the diluted one, you’re forcefully summoned as a Hero, eventually set to die. But what do you think will happen if you drink this one?"<br/>
"It’s the concentrate… right? What’s more, this is… not that world." (Naofumi)<br/>
"That’s right. What do you think?"<br/>
"In the first place, is there any need to kill… ah." (Naofumi)<br/>
For incidents caused by those immortal, I guess.<br/>
"I’ve left it with a trusted child, so I think it’s fine for now. If something happened to it, I did plan on retrieving it."<br/>
So Fitoria is his acquaintance.<br/>
two sips will make you immortal, right?<br/>
Then after that…<br/>
"Yep, It will grant you power for a battle without end. If you look at it from another angle, you become something like god. Easy, right?"<br/>
"…" (Naofumi)<br/>
"But… it may not be necessary for you guys. I mean, after you’ve made it all the way here."<br/>
And Arc closed the bottle.<br/>
"Us guys? Unnecessary?" (Naofumi)<br/>
"Ah, I’m sorry. Should I have warned you? As I thought, you never noticed. You guys, slipped through dimensions, so your awareness of it seems to be a bit off."<br/>
I try using the new power I had attained.<br/>
Following his lead, I try to increase my perception. I try tuning into the channel of world where all my comrades are.<br/>
"Naofumi-sama!"<br/>
"Raphtalia"<br/>
And there, was Raphtalia.<br/>
From her power, I could tell.<br/>
Raphtalia also talked with him, and came here by following the path.<br/>
The fact that our thoughts coincided made me a little happy.<br/>
"You guys continued walking your paths, and in the end, you changed yourselves. Do you feel it now? You spent an unfathomable amount of time out there."<br/>
"Geh!? Then what happened to the world we were supposed to save?" (Naofumi)<br/>
"Ah, don’t worry about that. That’s what the charm was for. I had the flow of time sped up around you. I thought that if your wills were strong enough, you would be able to handle it."<br/>
"What?" (Naofumi)<br/>
It’s true that I thought about the concept of magic as I walked, but that was still within the bounds of humanity.<br/>
Is he making fun of me?<br/>
"To be more specific, you’ve taken the first step. What do you want to do? Will you go further?"<br/>
"Please keep your jokes in moderation." (Naofumi)<br/>
"It’s not a joke, but… I still don’t think you guys have a chance of winning. Just try increasing your perception a little more. If you don’t decide your direction, you won’t be able to find your power."<br/>
"Direction…"<br/>
I could somewhat grasp what he was saying.<br/>
What sort of fighting style do I have?<br/>
What I’ve been doing has always been protecting.<br/>
There were times when I did damage the enemy myself, but they number too few to count.<br/>
My essential direction… It’s as if I’m deciding my path to Class Up.<br/>
As the Hero of the Shield, I never was able to, but this reasoning isn’t wrong.<br/>
I also feel there’s something similar to that popping up in my field of vision.<br/>
"What possibilities do you want to expand?"<br/>
Ark puts his hands together, and asks.<br/>
"Ah, there was something called Class Up in your world, right? Please think of this as something like that."<br/>
… What is this?<br/>
Since I’ve met up with Arc again, I’ve become able to sense his presence better.<br/>
Something like blood lust. Something that sends shivers down my spine is coming from him.<br/>
But for some reason, the person himself doesn’t seem to have any such intentions.<br/>
And wait, that doesn’t matter.<br/>
Let’s go become a god to beat up that Bitch Goddess.<br/>
"Even if you don’t decide, you’ll get power from the world you head to. But can you win with that? I think you’ll need to get something extra to win."<br/>
"That’s right. It’s a half-assed power. I won’t be able to win against her." (Naofumi)<br/>
"But if you drink that medicine from before, you will get plenty enough power to defeat her."<br/>
Saying that, he held out that red drink.<br/>
My changed body could understand that it wasn’t out of any ill intent.<br/>
But…<br/>
"… Understood." (Naofumi)<br/>
"Then take this–"<br/>
"Wrong, with a power given to me by a stranger, I realize that I have no chance of winning." (Naofumi)<br/>
Just like he has his own goal, I have mine.<br/>
If I get the power to Smack a Goddess, even after defeating her, my goal will not be fulfilled.<br/>
And with that, there’s no point.<br/>
"Naofumi-sama…" (Raphtalia)<br/>
"Raphtalia… yeah, that’s right." (Naofumi)<br/>
My eyes meet hers.<br/>
And what she was trying to say was transmitted to me.<br/>
… I am the Shield that Protects others, and Raphtalia is my Sword.<br/>
I have decided my direction.<br/>
From the start, I could only ever become a Shield for someone else.<br/>
Then what is there for me to change?<br/>
What Raphtalia’s decision was, was also transmitted.<br/>
I… Iwatani Naofumi have the disposition to protect.<br/>
I won’t go against it. I’ll protect everyone from this absurdity.<br/>
From all unfairness… The power to protect everyone.<br/>
If I don’t get a dream-like power like that, there’s no point.<br/>
Raphtalia answered my feelings.<br/>
And of course, it wasn’t just Raphtalia.<br/>
My power cannot stem from me alone.<br/>
There’s only meaning in my power when I have those I need to protect.<br/>
"You guys really are connected. I think it’s amazing. You trust the other person so much, and decided your directions to complement each other."<br/>
I feel the world expand around me.<br/>
I never noticed it before, but power is overflowing in my body.<br/>
A power that transcends the previous me.<br/>
… With this, I’ll be able to fight on an equal power with the Goddess Medea.<br/>
I mean, isn’t that right?<br/>
I’ve become the same sort of existence as the enemy.<br/>
Now all I have to do is develop a physical plan for victory.<br/>
It’s simple to understand. A Symbol to protect everyone… It’s simple.<br/>
I inject my own power, and the power outside into the Shield Strap, that had pretty much lost everything.<br/>
Three powers different powers fuse, and a new Shield is formed.<br/>
Its strength is incomparable to before.<br/>
All the power I have is sent directly to defense.<br/>
This is truly the power to protect, from all things.<br/>
"Trust is the key to power, but dependence is something else entirely. Please take that to heart; though I think you two will do fine."<br/>
As our views expanded, we noticed that behind Arc was a gate.<br/>
"Don’t you think it’s about time you set off? I don’t think you have too much time left, you know."<br/>
I open the Four Holy Weapons’ Manual<br/>
It was written on the page.<br/>
The Melromark’s army formation collapsed, and the reincarnators were closing in on Melty.<br/>
<br/>
