――I couldn’t stand being looked down on.<br/>
Being persecuted as a traitor by the demon king forces, not being trusted and shunned by both humans and demi-people.<br/>
I, Dionis Harberg being born into the Onizoku that was shouldered such a fate.<br/>
Every Onizoku was born with two horns by birth.<br/>
The magical power is controlled by those pair of horns.<br/>
However, I only have a horn growing on my forehead.<br/>
It took me much more effort than any other Onizoku to use magic. Moreover, I was physically weak and lose by power even to someone younger than myself.<br/>
It such a laughable body.<br/>
『Even if there is a horn, you are still my wonderful son』<br/>

『Dionis, I am happy just by you being healthy』<br/>
Said by scum mother who understands nothing while smiling to me, because no way I’m healthy if I had only a horn.<br/>
『Onii-chan! Teach me magic!』<br/>
Said by scum little sister who behaves like a spoiled child while trying to steal the water magic which is my special skill in spite of being born with two horn herself.<br/>
「Don’t fuck with me!」(Dionis)<br/>
Everyone in the village felt pity for me whom only has a horn.<br/>
I hate it, it’s irritating, it’s nauseated.<br/>
Everyone makes a fool of me just because I’m lacking a horn.<br/>

Report this adI can’t stand being looked down on.<br/>
That’s why I put my hand on everything.<br/>
Because I had a talent.<br/>
As for the sword, magic and even the jujutsu, I acquired it more than the average person by just having a bit practice.<br/>
The control of magic and strength were compensated by skills accordingly.<br/>
In just a few years, I became the strongest in the village.<br/>
The people in the village were weaker than me despite I has a handicap of having one horn.<br/>
Utterly, it makes me laugh.<br/>
Because every last one of them is no more than an incompetence trash.<br/>
Rather, I feel pity for them.<br/>
『Dionis is really amazing. You are amazingly awesome!!!』<br/>

Report this adIn spite of know nothing about myself, my whores of a childhood friend, Sharley, said that as she tries to get close to me.<br/>
Then after a while, I came to be called the strongest water user――”Water Ogre”.<br/>
It feels good to be adored by those heaps of trash.<br/>
After that, my glance turned to the outside of the Onizoku.<br/>
The irritating inferior species which look down on the Onizoku.<br/>
Start from that time, I have decided that I’m going to look down on everything except for myself.<br/>
To trampling, humiliating, and ridiculing.<br/>
Therefore, I betrayed the self-important Amatsu whose was greatly adored by the human. Then, I accept the invitation of Lucifina and decided to join the demon king forces.<br/>
I feel sick with the self-important Amatsu whose talking about a borrowed ideal with a position of a mere trash that unable to do nothing if he doesn’t have those powers.<br/>
There is no need for a human to be stronger than me. Plus, he’s similar to those people in the village, encourages me out of sympathy while looking down on me.<br/>
That is why, when I saw the crying face when he was betrayed, I feel as if I were at the height of my emotions.<br/>
It was refreshing when I cut down Luser’s who realised that he was on the side of being utilised all along.<br/>
It was a pleasant feeling as it became the habit of mine, to have slaughtered the humans and the demi-humans whom Amatsu helped before.<br/>
Not only the other races but the Onizoku who did not submit to me were also annihilated. Both my parents and my little sister was made into a mere lump of meat while I ridicule at their crying figure.<br/>
As for Sharley who are nothing than her good looks, she faint while having despair and pain as I turn her into one of my specimens.<br/>
I spare only Beltoga whose licked my shoes as he grovels in the ground. Moreover, I did not care about someone that unworthy for such title of “Flame Ogre”. Furthermore, I intended to kill him someday, but I was discouraged when I heard that he died in the Labyrinth of Purgatory.<br/>

Report this adBy killing Amatsu, I got to be entrusted with the labyrinth which is the stronghold for the demon king forces.<br/>
But I’m not going to end up in such place because I’m gonna slay the arrogant demon king who was in the demon king castle and trample down all the races who look down on me.<br/>
I came to able to use the “Demonization”.<br/>
I also mastered the loss magic.<br/>
I will not lose to anyone because right now I’m the mightiest existence.<br/>
From now on I will look down on others because I have been looked down a lot until now.<br/>
Humans, demi-humans, Mazoku’s and I will turn every single one of them to slave.<br/>
I trampled everything and kill them in despair.<br/>
I’m going to die in peace after I fulfil all of that.<br/>
I can not stand to be blended with the magical power.<br/>
I shall reach my contented death in order for me attain my own form in the netherworld.<br/>
I will have a peaceful death.<br/>
That’s what it is――――<br/>
「――――Ah?」(Dionis)<br/>
As I was awakened after my body was shaken and my whole body is damaged for some reason.<br/>
For some reason, my magical power is scarce too.<br/>
「What is happen to me……」(Dionis)<br/>
My memory is vague.<br/>
As I wake up slowly.<br/>

Dionis shrieking simultaneously when he saw my face as he was trying to drawing back, but unfortunately for him, he was hindered by the chain that binding his legs before he falls to the ground after being pulled by the chain.<br/>
「Wha, what is this?」(Dionis)<br/>

「Your horn is unexpectedly brittle, ain’t it? It broke after being touched lightly by Elfi, you know」(Iori)<br/>
「My horn areーAaaaRGH!?」(Dionis)<br/>
For an ogre, their horn is quite an important body part. Because the Onizoku performing the tuning of their magical power is by using their horn. Therefore if the horn is gone, they won’t be able to use their magic as before.<br/>
「Wh, why did you do something such……!」(Dionis)<br/>
「Because it would be troublesome to be attacked right after you woke up, won’t it? 」(Iori)<br/>
「Even so, that is soo cruel! With this, I won’t be able to use magic anymore!?」(Dionis)<br/>
Dionis crying while having his indigo hair dishevelled.<br/>
He probably unaware of it yet because he just woke up, thus I say something interesting.<br/>
「Rest assured, Dionis. Even if you can’t use magic right away, it will not be a problem anymore」(Iori)<br/>

Dionis which is thrown into the water were squirming about. Because of his tied legs, Dionis can only *PataPata* flapping his hands.<br/>
His breath ran out before long, and it seems that he noticed a change in his body as he swallowed the water unintentionally.<br/>
「Ga……Bo! Go, GoBoo!? GoOOOO!!」(Dionis)<br/>
As he restrains his belly with free hands while screeching with a desperate look.<br/>
He seems to have swallowed a lot of water in the meantime.<br/>

Elfi raised him to somewhere nearby as his white eye rolled up.<br/>
Dionis which was slammed on the ground has to spit out an impossible amount of water out of his mouth.<br/>

「You have to endure with it」(Iori)<br/>
Elfi frowned while having some bitter smile as she saw Dionis who *GeboGebo* vomiting the water.<br/>
He is vomiting water while suppressing his stomach as he struggles in suffering.<br/>
It is likely not to suffer this extent if the water were being drunk normally. But, I have done something to the current Dionis with a slightly special mechanism.<br/>

Report this adGenerally, the stomach has the role of digesting food, but it is not the only its functions. Among its functions, there is a thing that adjusts food to send to the duodenum. The part is known as『Pylorus』that locate at the end of the stomach…… I intentionally prevented the function of “Healing Magic” around that area.<br/>
In other words, if the current Dionis drink the water, those water will flow directly into the duodenum.<br/>
It is hard to imagine how painful it is, for the water to enter to the intestines vigorously.<br/>
「Pylorus……? My stomach……?」(Dionis)<br/>
I explained it in detail, but Dionis seemed unable to understand it well.<br/>
「In short, you can drink as much water as you want」(Iori)<br/>
「……H, hey Amatsu. I do not know what you are saying from a while ago. What are you going to do with m, me……?」(Dionis)<br/>
「There is nothing to ask because it already being decided」(Elfi)<br/>
Toward the questioning Dionis, Elfi mutters while lifting the chain.<br/>
That is exactly right.<br/>
There is no need to ask.<br/>
「――I’m going to kill you after you taste the suffering of hell」(Iori)<br/>
After confirming that Dionis had the expression of despair, Elfi knocked him down into the water once again.<br/>

「Gah……GoO」(Dionis)<br/>
Dionis is struggling in agony in the water.<br/>
Because his legs are tied up with chains, he could only to flapping his arm around.<br/>
Plus, he cannot destroy the chain and unable to use his magic by the result having his horn broken.<br/>

Elfi uses her demon eyes on Dionis who raised his face, to push back his face which was raised to catch some breath back into the water with the adjusted “Heavy Collapse”.<br/>
While Elfi just looks at him with a severely cold expression as struggling Dionis continue *GaboGabo* drowning by water.<br/>
He won’t take in the water if he just closes his mouth shut, but unfortunately for him because he had to open his mouth to catch some breath that has caused him to suffers and suffocated while doing so.<br/>
He writhes in agony each time he swallows a large quantity of water.<br/>
It a never-ending cycle.<br/>

Most of it was a thing that already extracted from the memory of Luser.<br/>
However, there was a harvest.<br/>
Besides there is a face that I have seen, it seems there were others who cooperated with Lucifina and Dionis.<br/>
I kept those name firmly in my memory.<br/>
「So you don’t have any other information?」(Iori)<br/>
「Oh, there is! It regarding the subordinate of Elfisuzaku……!」(Dionis)<br/>
「……Hou」(Elfi)<br/>
Elfi subordinates which were certainly slaughtered by Ortegia.<br/>
However, it seems that it was not all.<br/>
I do not know the number of people it is, but it seems there are people who manage to escape from the slaughter.<br/>
「…………」(Elfi)<br/>
Elfi closed her eyes and fell silent to think.<br/>
「Then……I have will tell you a lot!! So, please spare me!」(Dionis)<br/>
「……Let’s see, well then Dionis, I have a good suggestion, but do you want to hear it?」(Iori)<br/>
「I’ll hear it! I’ll listen, I’ll listen, please allowed me to hear it!」(Dionis)<br/>

As there was no helping for it, I suggested it to him.<br/>
「While grovelling in the ground and licking the floor with upturned eyes, in apologise say『I am an incompetent scum who can only harass the weak and I’m sorry for betraying you』and I might spare your life, you know」(Iori)<br/>
「Wha……!」(Dionis)<br/>
To such suggestion, Dionis face which was pale blue is slightly turning reddish.<br/>
Well, I guess he is furious deep in his heart.<br/>
Such a thing is said by someone “lower rank, the weakling” whom he looked down on until a while ago.<br/>
When I judging from the way he is, he won’t…<br/>

「I……I am an in……in, incompetent scum who……can only……ha, harass the weak. I……I’m so, so, sorry……for……betray, betraying y, you……!」(Dionis)<br/>
He really did the apology that I said to him.<br/>
I’m a little surprised.<br/>
Because this bastard got high feelings of pride, I assumed that he would say「As if I would do such a thing!」while losing his temper.<br/>
Even so, he seemed doesn’t want to die.<br/>
「A, Amatsu-sama…….Because I did as I was told……Can you spare me, please?」(Dionis)<br/>
「Aah」(Iori)<br/>

「――I’m just fooling around, you know」(Iori)<br/>
With the Jade Longsword, I lop off his outstretched wrist.<br/>
「Wha……?」(Dionis)<br/>
「As if I’m going to spare you. You told me that earlier, right? The『Why do you believe what others say unconditionally? I can’t understand it』」(Iori)<br/>
「Hae……iiiiiiiiiiii!?」(Dionis)<br/>
「I don’t understand too, you know. At this stage, you still have a nerve to believe that you would be spared」(Iori)<br/>
Dionis is screaming while restraining his arms.<br/>
「This won’t happen if you didn’t betray me at that time, besides」(Iori)<br/>
「AhAhAaaaRGhhH」(Dionis)<br/>
Consequently, *Bon* boom sound echoes successively. A cloud made of a red chunk falls like the rain to the surroundings.<br/>
「Haaeh?」(Dionis)<br/>
The other arm of Dionis was also gone missing from the wrist.<br/>
「――If you don’t kill my subordinate, this won’t happen, don’t you think so?」(Elfi)<br/>
Elfi said that with her eyes turn red.<br/>
「Guh……Gah, Gah……Gah」(Dionis)<br/>
Dionis starts convulsions spouting some red bubbles.<br/>
I was able to listen to the information while performing quite considerable harassment on him.<br/>
Two more steps left before I shall end it.<br/>
I take out the magic stone from the pouch.<br/>
While receiving the magical power from the magic stone, I extended my hand to Dionis’ head.<br/>
 <br/>

「Ah」(Dionis)<br/>
Dionis woke up by the time the preparation was over.<br/>
At the same time, he groans in the pain caused by the arm which got blown and lops off.<br/>
Right now Dionis were hanging in the mid-air in a state of “大” great character.<br/>
Like those specimen which he made terribly until now.<br/>
「Shall we end it Dionis」(Iori)<br/>
「Uugh……! Wait……Don’t kill me……! We were friends, right……?」(Iori)<br/>
「……Please, don’t make me laugh. As if we were friend」(Iori)<br/>

「……Iori. That fellow named Luser’s aside, why did all of your acquaintance not knowing when to give up?」(Elfi)<br/>
I would like to know it too.<br/>
While Dionis cries out saying “I do not want to die, I do not want to die”<br/>
「Every single one of you guys is always like that.<br/>
In spite of *GeraGera* laughing when hurting and trampling others. Every each one of you will start crying and beg for help after yourself is being put in such situation. Hey, have you ever let those who asked you to spare them to live?」(Iori)<br/>

「……! I am a genius, you get it! Unlike those inferior species such as humans and demi-humans! What’s wrong with cleaning the trash!」(Dionis)<br/>
「……Well, I agree with the last part though. I feel no sense of guilt in cleaning the trash called “you”」(Iori)<br/>
「Hii……!」(Dionis)<br/>
It’s the final finishing.<br/>
I’m directing the Jade Longsword toward Dionys who cannot move.<br/>

「Aah, you’re going to die. Pierce through the chest as it is and to sink to the bottom of the water」(Iori)<br/>
「I do not want to die, I do not want to die, I do not want to die! I want to have my contented death! I want to die happily! I’m going to the netherworld! I don’t want to die, STOOOOooOooOOP!!」(Dionis)<br/>
Followed by the sound of sword *Zupuri* penetrated the chest.<br/>
「Hyaa, Buh」(Dionis)<br/>
Dionis’ body loses power as he spat his breath.<br/>
Dionis fell into the water while tying by the chain on his foot.<br/>
He disappears to the bottom of water while dyeing the surface of the water into the red.<br/>
「Was that all right?」(Elfi)<br/>
I nod at Elfi question.<br/>
「Aah, It was unnecessary, but it was something necessary to do」(Iori)<br/>
 <br/>
◆<br/>
 <br/>
I’ll kill you, I’ll kill you, I’ll kill you, I’ll kill you, I’ll kill you, I’ll kill you, I’ll kill you, I’ll kill you!<br/>
While sinking to the bottom of the water, I chew the potion that I had been hide on the back of my teeth.<br/>
The last insurance that I kept for just in case.<br/>
The scar of the fatal wound opened to the chest is slightly blocked, and my magical power recovers only a little.<br/>
I’ll kill, I’ll kill, I’ll kill, I’m gonna kill both Amatsu and Elfisuzaku along with every single one of them too, I’ll kill, I’ll kill, I’ll kill, I’ll kill<br/>
Directing the wrist before me, I advance through the water.<br/>
Even without horns, a little magical power is sufficed enough to enable me to use magic.<br/>
I use the magic in the direction where I direct my wrist as I keep moving forward little by little.<br/>
I, no other than the “Water Demon Lord” and the “Water Ogre” itself.<br/>
It is easy to get through the predicament of this degree.<br/>
There’s a room in the depths of the water that has a hidden passage that leads to the outside. It is my victory if I manage to swim there.<br/>
I gonna heal my wound and kills both of them. I give them pains of several thousand times that I tasted.<br/>
What the hell with revenge and vengeance, such an idiotic duo.<br/>
It turns out like this because I do not give the decisive blow to that incompetence duo.<br/>
I will definitely have my contented death.<br/>
I cannot die in such a place.<br/>
To the netherworld, I’m going to the netherworld.<br/>
The hidden passage came into my view.<br/>
I escaped from there, then I――――<br/>
「――――」(Dionis)<br/>
What is this?<br/>
My sight is dyed white for a moment……<br/>
「――!?」(Dionis)<br/>
 <br/>
Eyes.<br/>
Eyes,Eyes,Eyes,Eyes,Eyes,Eyes,Eyes,Eyes,Eyes,Eyes,Eyes,Eyes,Eyes, Eyes,Eyes,Eyes,Eyes,Eyes,Eyes,Eyes,Eyes,Eyes,Eyes,Eyes,Eyes,Eyes, Eyes,Eyes,Eyes,Eyes,Eyes,Eyes,Eyes,Eyes,Eyes,Eyes,Eyes,Eyes,Eyes, Eyes,Eyes,Eyes,Eyes,Eyes,Eyes,Eyes,Eyes,Eyes,Eyes,Eyes,Eyes,Eyes, Eyes,Eyes,Eyes,Eyes,Eyes,Eyes,Eyes,Eyes,Eyes,Eyes,Eyes,Eyes,Eyes, Eyes,Eyes,Eyes,Eyes,Eyes,Eyes,Eyes,Eyes,Eyes,Eyes,Eyes,Eyes,Eyes, Eyes,Eyes,Eyes,Eyes,Eyes,Eyes,Eyes,Eyes,Eyes,Eyes,Eyes,Eyes,Eyes, Eyes,Eyes,Eyes,Eyes,Eyes,Eyes,Eyes,Eyes,Eyes,Eyes,Eyes,Eyes,Eyes, Eyes,Eyes,Eyes,Eyes,Eyes,Eyes,Eyes,Eyes,Eyes,Eyes,Eyes,Eyes,Eyes,Eyes.<br/>
Every single one of them was looking at me.<br/>
There were looking down on me.<br/>
To ridicule and make fun of me.<br/>
Stop it, and stop it, and stop it, and stop it!<br/>
「Hii!」(Dionis)<br/>
I swung my handless arms restlessly.<br/>
No, that’s not all.<br/>
Clothes, skin, everything has eyes.<br/>
Everything looks down on me.<br/>
「AAARGHbOAfGabBAff!」(Dionis)<br/>
The water comes into my mouth as my breathing is disturbed.<br/>
I can’t breathe.<br/>
「BOGAAaaAAh!?」(Dionis)<br/>
Water enters into the depths of my stomach.<br/>
Cold pain, sore pain, sore, cold, painful, it hurts!<br/>
「NgOOooOoOOfF?!」(Dionis)<br/>
I can’t see the hidden passage because of the eye to spreading through the whole surface.<br/>
I do not know where is in front, behind, above or below of me anymore.<br/>
The water keep comes in.<br/>
Those eyes still keep looking down on me.<br/>
Stop it, Stop it, Stop it, Stop it, Stop it, please stop it!!<br/>
「Nnnnmmff!」(Dionis)<br/>
Even if I close my mouth, I open it reflexive as I seek for oxygen.<br/>
Every time I did that, the water comes in.<br/>
My consciousness started to fade.<br/>
「Ba……gaaaAAFF」(Dionis)<br/>
But those eyes don’t go away.<br/>
Only the eyes remain vivid.<br/>
I do not want to.<br/>
It’s a lie, it’s impossible.<br/>
No, I do not want to, I don’t want to die. I don’t want to die!<br/>
「Nnoo……OOH……」(Dionis)<br/>
I’m going to depart while having my contented death!<br/>
Because I, Dionis Harberg, are the “Water Ogre”!?<br/>
I do not want to die unsightly, I do not want to.<br/>
No, I’m afraid, I’m scared, help me, somebody helps me!<br/>
Lucifina, Luser, Amatsu, Elfisuzaku, anyone, anybody!<br/>
It is dark, It is dark, It is dark, It is dark, I’m scared, I’m scared, I’m scared, I’m scared!<br/>
AAAAAAAAAAAAHHHHH.<br/>
I’m sorry for betraying you, I was wrong!<br/>
Please, I’m begging you, Amatsu-sama, Elfisuzaku-sama please help me, I’m begging you!<br/>
It’s Lucifina fault, I was being deceived by her cajolery, Aaaaarghhh, No, I do not want to lie at that time, if I just don’t betray you, I don’t want this, I hate it, somebody please help me――<br/>
「Mmf」(Dionis)<br/>
I don’t want to die――――<br/>
 <br/>
◆<br/>
 <br/>
The brainwash magic.<br/>
The technique that I stole from Olivia and used it on Dionis.<br/>
I planted a strong image in Dionis’ brain.<br/>
Because he did not want to be looked down on, I purposely plant in his brain with plentiful images of『Eyes that looking down on』<br/>
Because of that, I have been using a lot of magic stones on hand.<br/>
It took a lot of time.<br/>
When stabbing his chest, I deliberately to miss the fatal wound.<br/>
In order to not let him die, I applied a little healing magic too.<br/>
Why did I do that? Because I wanted to kill him in fear and despair.<br/>
Because of the lack of the magical power and extreme fatigue my consciousness is about to fade away.<br/>
「It’s over」(Elfi)<br/>
「……Aah」(Iori)<br/>
I nod for words of Elfi as I maintain my consciousness.<br/>
Dionis<br/>
You certainly wanted to have a contented death.<br/>
The world after death――to go to the netherworld.<br/>
The condition to go to the netherworld is a contented death without a regret.<br/>
「Say, Dionis」(Iori)<br/>
On the surface of the water which became calm, I asked.<br/>
「Have you obtained your contented death?」(Iori)<br/>
Though he does not hear it, the answer is probably not.<br/>
