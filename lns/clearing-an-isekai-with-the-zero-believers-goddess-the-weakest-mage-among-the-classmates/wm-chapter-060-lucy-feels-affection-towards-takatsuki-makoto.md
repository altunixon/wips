<br/>
-Lucy POV-<br/>
"Eh? You are dating Jean now?!" (Lucy)<br/>
It was something that happened while I was having lunch together with Emily.<br/>
"Yeah. Or more like, you were the one who told me to confess already." (Emily)<br/>
"D-Did I?" (Lucy)<br/>
The friend I hadn’t seen in a while now has a man.<br/>
Well, they were practically dating since the moment I met them though.<br/>
"But what about you, Lucy?" (Emily)<br/>
"Uuuh…" (Lucy)<br/>
Of course she would ask.<br/>
"Uhm, the new girl that joined the party, that Aya girl…yesterday, she and Makoto-kun…" (Emily)<br/>
"M-Makoto said nothing happened there!" (Lucy)<br/>
"But they did enter the hot spring together." (Emily)<br/>
"Ugh…" (Lucy)<br/>
Yesterday I thought they would want to have alone time to talk, so I gave them some space, but…<br/>
I didn’t think they would have so much progress in just half a day! <br/>
"It seems like they have known each other since way back in their world. Aren’t you in trouble, Lucy?" (Emily)<br/>
"Wuuuh…" (Lucy)<br/>
It has been a party of Makoto and I only until now.<br/>
From now on, it will be a party of three.<br/>
"Makoto-kun and Aya-chan might become an item, you know." (Emily)<br/>
"…"<br/>
I imagine what might happen the next time we go out to an adventure.<br/>
Makoto and Aya get excited as they talk about their previous world.<br/>
When the adventure is over, they will say: ‘We are going to go to the hot spring together for a bit’, ‘wait in the guild, Lucy-san’, and then I will go: ‘Eh? Wait…’<br/>
I would then wait with my head down at the guild’s stalls.<br/>
And then, the two of them will appear with arms linked…<br/>
"N-Noooo!", I screamed.<br/>
"Then, confess already." (Emily)<br/>
Emily says straight.<br/>
Damn it, just because you have a boyfriend already, you are acting as if you are above me.<br/>
"Emily-san…how should I confess?" (Lucy)<br/>
"Uhm, in my case…" (Emily)<br/>
I consulted with Emily about the way to confess.<br/>
◇◇<br/>
 -Takatsuki Makoto POV-<br/>
"Eh? You want to go goblin hunting, Lucy?" (Makoto)<br/>
It was pretty rare of her.<br/>
We have some leeway because of our earnings in Laberintos, so there’s no need to go get such small change.<br/>
"Y-Yeah. Y-You know, isn’t it important to go back to your roots?" (Lucy)<br/>
That’s a nice saying.<br/>
"Alright then, let’s go too, Sa-san." (Makoto)<br/>
It has been a while since I have gone goblin hunting.<br/>
It is just the right thing for our first campaign as a party of three! It is safe too.<br/>
"Goblins, huh. I would rather not. I am being taught martial arts by Nina-san recently. I will be showing up there", is what Sa-san said.<br/>
"….Eeeh?" (Makoto)<br/>
"Don’t make that face. I have already seen goblins a plenty lot in Laberintos." (Aya)<br/>
Even though it is our first campaign as a party of three, she went ‘I would rather not’.<br/>
Alright, I will go alone with Lucy then~.<br/>
Lucy pumps her fist lightly.<br/>
Hm?<br/>
◇◇<br/>
I use water magic to advance upstream through the river that flows in the Great Forest.<br/>
Lucy was clinging to me.<br/>
It has been a while since we have done this.<br/>
"Hey, can I ask one thing?", Lucy asks.<br/>
"What’s the matter?" (Makoto)<br/>
"The Moving Water Walk, you can use it even if you don’t touch each other’s body, right?" (Lucy)<br/>
"Of course, I can use it even if we are apart. It is just that we can economize the mana used if our bodies are touching each other." (Makoto)<br/>
The amount of mana I have is low, so the economization habit has stuck into me pretty deeply.<br/>
…I do think I have a bit of a poor man’s mentality.<br/>
"It is not that you want me to hug you that you are telling me all the time to cling onto you, right?" (Lucy)<br/>
"No. Or more like, you can just put your hand on my shoulder. There’s no need to hug me so tightly." (Makoto)<br/>
Lucy’s chest is pressing against me and even now I still get nervous.<br/>
"I don’t wanna. When you use your water magic to move, I feel like I will get shaken off at a curve or something." (Lucy)<br/>
"Aah, that’s true." (Makoto)<br/>
It feels good to accelerate to the peak when turning.<br/>
While we were having that casual talk, we arrived at our objective location.<br/>
The mist was thick and it was dark.<br/>
Even though it is morning, the air is cold.<br/>
We are close to the Demonic Forest. <br/>
There’s a whole lot of monster alerts from Detection.<br/>
Aah, how nostalgic.<br/>
"Fuuh! I have returned." (Makoto)<br/>
"…I may have been the one who invited you, but Makoto, you really do love hunting goblins." (Lucy)<br/>
I even got an embarrassing nickname after all.<br/>
It is the quest that I have the most confidence in since coming to this world. <br/>
The two of us hunted goblins for a while.<br/>
"Lucy, your control with magic has gotten better." (Makoto)<br/>
Lucy’s face brightens up in an instant.<br/>
"Right?! It is thanks to the magic bracelet that the Great Sage-sama gave me. When I have this on, my magic proficiency gets amplified." (Lucy)<br/>
"Ooh, can I borrow it later?" (Makoto)<br/>
"It doesn’t have any effect when over 50 in proficiency, is what was written in the instructions." (Lucy)<br/>
There was an instruction manual?! <br/>
Great Sage-sama even gives thorough service.<br/>
It doesn’t seem like it would do much for me then.<br/>
I am over 100 now in proficiency.<br/>
"Hey, you have any plans later?" (Lucy)<br/>
Lucy changes the subject.<br/>
"Hmm, I was thinking about continuing hunting. Do you have something in mind?" (Makoto)<br/>
"There’s a place I would like to go to." (Lucy)<br/>
"Alright, I will accompany you." (Makoto)<br/>
The precision of Lucy’s magic has increased, and there’s no dangers for now.<br/>
As long as we don’t go deep into the Demonic Forest, it should be okay.<br/>
I use water magic and we once again move.<br/>
"Where to?" (Makoto)<br/>
"Uhm, turn right around there, I think." (Lucy)<br/>
"…That’s the Forest of the Lost, you know?" (Makoto)<br/>
It doesn’t have monsters as dangerous as the ones in the Demonic Forest, but the whole forest there is a dungeon.<br/>
Unless you have the Map skill, it is said that you would get lost and can’t get out.<br/>
Recommended rank is above Iron.<br/>
We do pass that bar, but I wasn’t planning on going to a dungeon today.<br/>
"It is okay. The Forest of the Lost is the playing ground of the elf children. I have gone a whole lot in the past, so I know the safe routes." (Lucy)<br/>
If Lucy says so, it should be fine.<br/>
"I leave the navigation to you." (Makoto)<br/>
"Got it~." (Lucy)<br/>
We proceed deeper into the dungeon forest.<br/>
"Lucy, we are lost, aren’t we?" (Makoto)<br/>
"W-We are not! It has been a while since I have been here so, uhm…it should be around here." (Lucy)<br/>
"…I will make sure we can return by using my Mapping Skill." (Makoto)<br/>
Will it be okay? <br/>
While having slight doubts, we go deeper.<br/>
◇◇<br/>
"Hoh, it is here, huh." (Makoto)<br/>
We were at a blooming flower bed that covered my whole sight. <br/>
It is an isekai flower bed with a whole lot of flowers that I have never seen in Japan.<br/>
"It is beautiful, isn’t it? It is the secret place of the elves." (Lucy)<br/>
It was natural for Lucy to be bragging about it, that’s how beautiful it is.<br/>
I look around and advance while making sure I don’t step on any flowers.<br/>
A sweet scent tickles my nostrils.<br/>
"Hey, sit here." (Lucy)<br/>
Within the flower bed, there was a rock with a size good enough for two people to sit on.<br/>
I sat by the side of Lucy.<br/>
"……"<br/>
"……"<br/>
What is it? The silence continues.<br/>
Now that I think about it, did Lucy have some business?<br/>
"H-Hey, how has it been lately?" (Lucy)<br/>
"Even if you ask me how it has been…" (Makoto)<br/>
We meet every day.<br/>
"Is the Goddess doing well?" (Lucy)<br/>
"…Yeah, she is." (Makoto)<br/>
She throws me a weirdly positioned topic.<br/>
Could it be that she has noticed that I have been worrying about Noah-sama lately?<br/>
"Did something happen?" (Lucy)<br/>
"…No, it is okay." (Makoto)<br/>
"If you are troubled by something, tell me. We are comrades, right?" (Lucy)<br/>
The big eyes of Lucy were looking at my face.<br/>
Lucy is my first companion since coming to this world.<br/>
I don’t really want to hide too much from her.<br/>
But the matter about being the Apostle of an Evil God is still a mess inside my head.<br/>
I would like her to wait for a bit more.<br/>
Now that I think about it, I have known Lucy for a good amount of time now.<br/>
When I was in the Water Temple, I would go ‘I am going to push through solo!’. And I actually did go solo for a few months in Makkaren.<br/>
(But the Griffon subjugation and the Laberintos exploration would have been unthinkable without Lucy.) (Makoto)<br/>
If I was told to go solo as an adventurer, would I be able to?<br/>
I have become stronger than 1 year ago.<br/>
But I don’t want to be an adventurer alone anymore…<br/>
Lucy was fiddling with her legs while sitting on the rock.<br/>
Her eyebrows were knitted.<br/>
Her side-profile is as beautiful as always.<br/>
I should thank Lucy.<br/>
About everything she has done for me, and that I look forward to continuing working with her.<br/>
"Hey, Lucy." "Hey, Makoto."<br/>
We both speak at the same time.<br/>
""……""<br/>
We fall silent while looking at each other.<br/>
I am just gonna thank her, but now that I think again, it is a bit embarrassing.<br/>
Lucy skids closer to me. <br/>
A distance where her breath could touch me.<br/>
I could feel the high temperature of Lucy.<br/>
"U-Uhm…Makoto…" (Lucy)<br/>
"…Yeah, what is it, Lucy?" (Makoto)<br/>
What’s going on?<br/>
What’s this atmosphere?<br/>
It is as if she is about to confess to me…<br/>
No no no, don’t misunderstand, me.<br/>
Didn’t Jean tell me that I shouldn’t cause love troubles within the party?<br/>
"Uhm…I…", Lucy wanted to say something, but…<br/>
"…Wait, Lucy. We are being watched." (Makoto)<br/>
"Eh?!" (Lucy)<br/>
I was late to notice!<br/>
We are surrounded.<br/>
I get down from the rock and take a stance with my dagger.<br/>
This is bad.<br/>
There’s no water around.<br/>
Lucy is grabbing my sleeve.<br/>
(I have to let Lucy escape…) (Makoto)<br/>
"…They are not attacking?" (Makoto)<br/>
"…Could it be…" (Lucy)<br/>
Lucy makes a troubled expression.<br/>
"Oh my, we were caught." "Lucy-neechan, is that your boyfriend?" "As I thought, it really is the daughter of Rozari-san. You have brought a man from a nice race." "Hey hey! Introduce us to your boyfriend, Lucy!" <br/>
People were coming out in droves?! <br/>
Moreover, they are all elves!<br/>
"Eh?! No way. Why is everyone…" (Lucy)<br/>
Lucy was flustered.<br/>
"Acquaintances?" (Makoto)<br/>
"N-Neighbors in my hometown…" (Lucy)<br/>
"We were planning on having a picnic with everyone today~." <br/>
"When we were about to, Lucy-neechan came with a man." <br/>
"So we all hid." <br/>
Uwaah, I didn’t notice at all.<br/>
As expected of elves that live in the forest.<br/>
Does everyone have the Stealth Skill?<br/>
"S-S-Since when were you watching?!" (Lucy)<br/>
"""""From the very beginning.""""""<br/>
"NOOOOO!!" (Lucy)<br/>
Ah, Lucy ran away.<br/>
The elf children ran after her.<br/>
I was attacked by questions from the neighbors of Lucy.<br/>
The elf acquaintances of Lucy were all friendly.<br/>
They weren’t the isolated and unfriendly type that I imagined they would be.<br/>
Also, the old lady elf gave me a mountain-like amount of fruits, and it was really hard to bring them back.<br/>
