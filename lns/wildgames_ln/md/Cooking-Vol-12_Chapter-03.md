Chapter 3: The Night Before the Meeting<br/>
<br/>
1<br/>
The next day, the 13th of the White Month, after Rii Sudora replaced me in the afternoon, I left the stall a little excitedly. I was planning to visit the stall Yang had set up when I make my trip to the inns.<br/>
The members were the same as yesterday, Leina Wu, Ai Fa and Ludo Wu, and four other hunters. Ai Fa who was beside me asked:<br/>
"Asuta, why are you so excited?"<br/>
"Hmm? Do I look excited? I’m just looking forward to the stall opened by that chef Yang."<br/>
"Looking forward? But why?"<br/>
"I don’t know how to tell you… I have a lot in common with that chef, and I’m curious about the food he will make with the ingredients from the Post Station Town."<br/>
"Yes, I’m intrigued too."<br/>
Leina Wu smiled brilliantly in agreement.<br/>
Ai Fa muttered "Is that so" quietly after seeing Leina Wu’s smile.<br/>
"He is your cooking rival, but since he opened a stall in the Post Station Town… That means he is also your business competitor."<br/>
"Huh, Ai Fa, you know that term too? Well… That will be even more reason to learn what kind of dish Yang is making."<br/>
This was a bold and crazy scheme to let the people in Genos understand the deliciousness of grilled poitan.<br/>
From my meeting with Yang yesterday, he took up this challenge because he felt obligated to as a chef.<br/>
The value of a dish doesn’t depend on its ingredients… I was looking forward to what sort of dish Yang would make with such a conviction.<br/>
"Asuta, is it that stall?"<br/>
Leina Wu tugged at my sleeve.<br/>
I looked over and saw a mob at the place we were headed in. It was between the marketplace and the inns, and to our right.<br/>
There were 40 to 50 people gathered there, taking up half of the 10 m wide paved road.<br/>
"Yes, that’s probably the place."<br/>
I suppressed the excitement in my heart and walked towards the crowd.<br/>
Suddenly, the fragrance of warm nyuushi entered my nasal cavity. That was enough evidence to indicate that Yang’s stall was there.<br/>
"Uwah, there are too many people and I can’t see anything. This is more crowded than I imagined."<br/>
"I see. Want to ride on my shoulder to take a look?"<br/>
Ai Fa asked me with a serious face.<br/>
She then bent her knees, and I answered hurriedly: "It’s fine, it’s fine!"<br/>
"Let’s queue up properly. I wanted to buy one of Yang’s cookings anyway."<br/>
"Is that so."<br/>
So our group joined the end of the queue.<br/>
But we were a large group with six hunters. The customers who didn’t understand the situation all left the outer circle after seeing us. From their reactions, most of the customers were westerners with ivory or yellowish brown skin.<br/>
I feel bad, am I disrupting his business?<br/>
But thanks to that, we finally saw the stall hidden behind the mob.<br/>
The pushcart was just like ours. A young woman was attending to the customers with a smile.<br/>
Yang, who was dressed in white, cooked right beside her, and there were two guards standing beside the stall. They were guards from the Count Taliem house, and their attire was more lavished than the town guards. A Count Taliem house banner was also displayed at the stall.<br/>
Amazing, he is not hiding about being a chef of the nobles at all.<br/>
There were guards at the stall too, so I thought the townsfolk would stay away because of the tight security… However, business at the stall was booming instead.<br/>
This was the southern end of the marketplace, so they couldn’t rent this spot without greasing the hands of the renters. It was right beside the inns and had great foot traffic. It was almost noon, which was the peak period for the food stalls.<br/>
However, this was the first time I saw a stall that could gather so many people, which was comparable to my kiba stalls during the morning rush hour.<br/>
"Ohh, it’s you, Mr. Asuta. Thank you for gracing our stall."<br/>
When it was our turn, Yang who was focused on making the dishes raised his head.<br/>
He was wearing the same white attire that I was forced to wear in Pyschkurewuss’ manor and had a conical hat on his head. His skinny but healthy face was sweaty from the day’s work.<br/>
"Thank you for your hard work. It’s great that business is flourishing."<br/>
"Yes, it’s not bad for the first day."<br/>
Yang nodded with a serious face:<br/>
"Pardon me, there are still people waiting in line, so please place your order."<br/>
"Alright then…"<br/>
I then locked eyes with the woman beside Yang.<br/>
She had her long brown hair tied behind her head and wore a scarf-like thing on her head. The sleeves of her blouse were long and an apron covered her front. She was an elegant young lady.<br/>
She was probably afraid of the hunters around me. Her ivory colored face was a little pale as she smiled meekly:<br/>
"Welcome. It would be one red copper plate per piece. Which color would you like?"<br/>
"Huh? Color?"<br/>
The lady nodded and pointed to the right side of the counter. There were three different colored poitan on display there.<br/>
They were around 15 cm wide, thus one size smaller than the wrapping I used for the "Myam-roasted meat", and were flat and round.<br/>
What surprised me was their color. One was a normal cream color, while the other two were light orange and green.<br/>
"Gigo is added to the white one, the red one contains neenon, while the green one has nanaru. They all cost one red copper plate per piece, please select the color you prefer."<br/>
I was shocked, so the coloring was from the vegetables.<br/>
I was the one who taught them that adding gigo would soften the texture. But gigo and poitan were both cream colored, so there wasn’t any visible difference.<br/>
Neenon was a carrot-like vegetable, and I had not used nanaru in my cooking yet. It seemed to be a vegetable similar to spinach.<br/>
It’s one red copper plate per piece.<br/>
From the size of the wrapping, this was a reasonable price. It was about half the size of the "Myam-roasted meat" that cost two red copper plates.<br/>
When I first tried a "Kimyusu meat bun" in the Post Station Town, a small one cost one red copper plate. One was enough for a child, but an adult would need to eat two. They probably thought that by reducing the price, customers visiting for the first time would find it easier to accept.<br/>
"Erm… Which one would you like?"<br/>
The lady asked with a wavering business smile.<br/>
I answered: "One red and one green."<br/>
I decided to buy one for Leina Wu and me.<br/>
"Thank you for your patronage. Please wait a moment."<br/>
This lady was definitely an associate of the Count Taliem house from the city. I had never seen someone who attended to the customers so politely in the Post Station Town.<br/>
Inside the stall was a big pot, with brown colored paste cooking inside. I caught a whiff of karon, nyuushi, and a fragrance of some herb.<br/>
The thick brown ingredient was covered by the poitan wrapping. It had the same shape as the "Myam-roasted meat", triangular just like crepes. It was easy for the round wrapping to be folded into this shape.<br/>
"Thank you for waiting."<br/>
"Thank you. Well then… I will give you my feedback next time."<br/>
"Alright, thank you for coming."<br/>
Yang bowed at me with a serious face.<br/>
He probably never served any customers directly in the city. He was serious and stubborn, with focus entirely on his work. However, his distrust towards Forest’s Edge denizens had reduced after meeting Michael. I could feel the ‘rude’ part of his ‘hardworking and rude’ attitude was gone.<br/>
We left the stall quickly after getting our target product. The stall was then mobbed by customers again. We stood at a spot some distance away and watched them in relief.<br/>
"It smells nice. Is this the fragrance of karon nyuushi?"<br/>
Leina Wu asked with a serious gaze as she held Yang’s cooking in her hands. Leina Wu’s share was orange, while mine is green.<br/>
"That’s right. It also has the fragrance of karon meat and some herbs."<br/>
"Is that so? I feel a little tense about eating meat that isn’t kiba."<br/>
However, Leina Wu already ate kimyusu and karon when I was teaching Milano Mast to cook in the 《Kimyusu’s Tail Inn》. Skinless kimyusu meat and karon thigh meat tasted bland… Leina Wu already knew how we made them into dishes, and she was now trying this dish with that in mind.<br/>
"Let’s dig in."<br/>
"Okay."<br/>
We bit in at the same time.<br/>
First of all, the butter like nyuushi and the fragrance of a herb I never tried before entered my nasal cavity.<br/>
It was a sweet smell that compliments the nyuushi’s fragrance. To me, it was similar to cinnamon.<br/>
The karon that was cooked into a mush and the fragrance of vegetables spread in my mouth.<br/>
The karon thigh meat had just the right chewiness. I wondered what vegetables were used here. Anyway, I could taste the sweetness of the neenon, aria, and many other vegetables.<br/>
Since nanaru was added into the poitan, there should the bitterness of vegetables in there. However, that was mitigated by the taste of the fillings. On the other hand, because gigo wasn’t added, the wrapping was a little dried. The filling was juicy, so that wasn’t a problem.<br/>
Anyway, the theme of this dish seemed to be sweetness. The sweetness of the nyuushi, karon meat, and vegetables… That cinnamon-like herb was probably used to bind all this taste together.<br/>
Aside from this herb, there didn’t seem to be any other seasoning. The karon thigh meat was probably marinated in salt, but there wasn’t any obvious saltiness or spiciness about it. Maybe the salt was used to bring out the sweetness of the dish.<br/>
This taste… is probably mixed with the nyuushi as the main ingredient.<br/>
With seasoning other than salt so sparse in the Post Station Town, my dish was seasoned with the fragrance of the myam, the sourness of tarapa, and the sweetness of the fruit wine. Together with salt and Pico leaves, I managed to cook dishes that were satisfactory to me.<br/>
On the other hand, Yang used nyuushi and an unknown cinnamon-like herb to create this taste.<br/>
It was shockingly delicious. Personally, I found it hard to get used to a dish that emphasized sweetness. If it was me, I wouldn’t go down this route. However, his skills in bringing out the sweetness of meat and vegetables, and using the fragrance of nyuushi and herbs showed his outstanding culinary prowess and taste.<br/>
To be honest, this was very well done. This was the first time I ate a dish that was so complete in the Post Station Town.<br/>
Leina Wu, who still had a serious expression, said: "Is this a dish made by cooking minced meat and vegetables?"<br/>
"Yes. He probably seared the meat with nyuushi and cooked it together with the vegetables after the meat turned soft. He used aria and neenon… And maybe tino and chachi."<br/>
"I think there is tino too. But its form is completely gone."<br/>
"Ah, nyuushi was probably added when he cooked it. That must be why it has such a thick texture."<br/>
It was a small dish, but Leina Wu and I got engrossed in analyzing it after taking a bite. Ai Fa and the others kept watch on the street and weren’t interested in our conversation.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
"The color of this poitan wrapping is surprising, but it has nothing to do with the taste. In that case, wouldn’t adding gigo make it tastier?"<br/>
"That’s true. This is probably done to attract customers. Can you taste the neenon…?"<br/>
"I think… it didn’t change the taste of the poitan. Or maybe I just can’t tell."<br/>
"It’s fine, I can’t taste the nanaru either. Why don’t we try each other’s share…?"<br/>
Leina Wu suddenly blushed, and someone kicked my leg from behind.<br/>
I turned back and saw Ai Fa’s unhappy face.<br/>
"Erm, Asuta… I’m sorry, but non-family members sharing a portion is… something that Forest’s Edge denizen mustn’t do."<br/>
"Ah, t-that’s right. Sorry for being careless."<br/>
I remember sharing my hamburg steak with Rimee Wu, and Ludo Wu sharing a meat bun with Tara. So children were exempted from this, huh.<br/>
In any case, I was in the wrong this time. I will treat the pain in my leg as a sincere reminder.<br/>
Ludo Wu didn’t take his eyes off the street as he said: "The smell is appetizing. Leina-nee, can I have a bite?"<br/>
Leina Wu said "Okay." without a second thought and gave the half-eaten portion to her brother.<br/>
"Ah, Ai Fa, if you don’t mind…"<br/>
"I’m not eating."<br/>
I had no choice but to take a second bite.<br/>
After taking a bite of his sister’s portion, Ludo Wu said in a muffled voice:<br/>
"Is this good? I don’t think it’s bad though."<br/>
"This is impressive after working on this for just two days. But the taste is a little too simple."<br/>
"… I don’t understand! I think the food cooked by Leina-nee or Asuta is the best."<br/>
That was because we had the advantage of kiba meat. At the very least, I thought Yang’s dish was on par with the "Kimyusu meatball" and ‘Fried shredded karon" served in the 《Kimyusu’s Tail Inn》. And, of course, Yang had the advantage of using nyuushi, but the fact remained that he developed such an impressive dish.<br/>
The colorful poitan wrapping and fragrance of the nyuushi attracted the crowd, and the price was just one red copper plate. All this was part of their strategy. In the Post Station Town where there weren’t any chefs, Yang showed how capable he was.<br/>
"Oh, you really came."<br/>
Someone called out to me with a laugh.<br/>
He was a tall westerner wearing a hood and a grey cloth covering his mouth, the "guardian" Zashuma.<br/>
"Ah, hello. Things seem to be going smoothly."<br/>
"That’s right. This is crowded enough for the first day. The people have calmed down now, but in the beginning, many of them were surprised about that being poitan."<br/>
Zashuma smiled behind the hunters:<br/>
"A chef is on a different level. You can’t find a stall with such a delicious dish in the Post Station Town. I prefer snacks that go well with wine…"<br/>
"Oh, so you tried it too."<br/>
"This is part of my battle too. Sorry for not trying your cooking yet…"<br/>
"It’s fine, you don’t need to worry about it."<br/>
The yellow-skinned Zashuma was probably born around Genos. Maybe he detested the Forest’s Edge too.<br/>
Polarse said he didn’t dare to eat kiba, so it couldn’t be helped. We couldn’t really complain since he was willing to ally himself with the Forest’s Edge despite his status.<br/>
However, there was one other thing that bothered me.<br/>
"Speaking of which, it seems that only the westerners are gathered around Yang’s stall."<br/>
"Yes, and the southerners and easterners crowd around your stalls. Isn’t it great that both of you have a different target market?"<br/>
In terms of sales, he was right. But our goal was to let the westerners understand the taste of kiba. In that sense, Yang’s stall might be my greatest competitor.<br/>
And I will have to compete with him head-on.<br/>
I also needed to keep in mind that all the stalls would have access to nyuushi, so the dishes in the Post Station Town would improve too.<br/>
I could also use nyuushi, and also the new ingredient, kimyusu egg. If I was to get the manpower, I could add another stall and sell new dishes.<br/>
However, that would be after settling things with Pyschkurewuss. If we couldn’t get an acceptable result, all the work to promote kiba would be wasted.<br/>
"Anyways, the chef of a noble opening a stall in the Post Station Town is unprecedented. Just this fact alone is mind-blowing. And they are showing the family crest of the Count Taliem house proudly, so this is a good thing."<br/>
Zashuma said with renewed vigor:<br/>
"News that the Count Taliem house was the one who helped you when you got kidnapped by Count Turan’s daughter had spread in the Post Station Town. Those who detest the denizens of Forest’s Edge will definitely avoid stalls affiliated with the Count Taliem house. On the flip side… Shops with Count Turan’s crest in plain view won’t do so well now."<br/>
"Yes, that means…"<br/>
Of the westerners present, half of them wavered at the sight of the Forest’s Edge hunters. But they didn’t really hate the Forest’s Edge either.<br/>
"The conflict between Forest’s Edge denizens and Pyschkurewuss is the talk of the town, and there are people who think Pyschkurewuss is in the wrong. That Kaslan Lutim from Forest’s Edge has a firm grasp of the situation. I don’t mean that in a bad way… I’m really surprised that the Forest’s Edge settlement has such a talented man."<br/>
"Yes, he surprises me often too."<br/>
"I feel really comfortable chatting with him. When this troublesome matter is resolved, I will have a drink with him…" Zashuma stopped mid-sentence and narrowed his eyes. "… Just kidding, now isn’t the time for idle chatter. I’m going now, take care of yourself."<br/>
"Huh? What do you mean…"<br/>
Before I could finish, Zashuma mixed into the crowd. I looked around for a while and saw Ai Fa staring at the north.<br/>
"Ludo Wu, that’s a soldier working for Pyschkurewuss."<br/>
Suddenly, the hunters around Leina Wu and me tightened their perimeter around us.<br/>
"… Denizens of the Forest’s Edge, it’s fortunate that we see you here."<br/>
An important looking figure came from the north and stopped before us. Wearing white leather armor and a thin sword by his waist, this person was one of the guards from Pyschkurewuss’ mansion.<br/>
"You must be Asuta and Ai Fa of the Fa house. I’m the captain of Count Turan’s first guard team, Jimon. Is there anyone from the tribal chief Wu clan amongst you?"<br/>
"I’m the youngest son of the Wu clan main house, Ludo Wu. Tell me what business you have with us."<br/>
Ludo Wu walked to Jimon, with a hunter’s fiery burning in his eyes.<br/>
The pedestrians became rowdy when they saw a guard with the crest of Count Turan house facing off with the hunters of Forest’s Edge. Jimon said very calmly despite the noise:<br/>
"My lord, Count Pyschkurewuss Turan, has a message for you, please relay it accurately to the tribal chiefs of the Forest’s Edge. It’s about the conference two days later…"<br/>
Jimon then told us two things. When he mentioned the second matter, Ai Fa’s blue eyes erupted in intense fury, and she yelled: "Don’t mess with us!"<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
2<br/>
A few hours later we completed our work on time and returned to the Wu clan village.<br/>
However, the atmosphere was heavy on our way back. Ai Fa and the other hunters were still angry.<br/>
"Ara, good work today. What’s wrong…? Everyone has a scary expression?"<br/>
Barcia of Marsala who had blended into this village completely put down her machete and tilted her head baffledly. Ryada Wu who was keeping watch over her also frowned, while Mida just stared blankly at us.<br/>
"Well, Pyschkurewuss’ minion gave us a troubling message. Ryada Wu, are Dad and the others still in the forest…?"<br/>
"Yes, it’s still early. It will be a while before they return."<br/>
"Is that so. Dad will be furious. Maybe he won’t get mad at us for getting angry."<br/>
"Just what is going on? Can you tell me?"<br/>
Barcia’s stone lion-like face looked tense.<br/>
Ludo Wu turned towards her and scratched his brown hair.<br/>
"I guess there is no need to hide it from you. Pyschkurewuss raised an overboard condition for the conference two days later."<br/>
"Condition?"<br/>
"Yes. First, the venue will be changed to the Count Turan manor in the city, as he is not feeling well."<br/>
This wasn’t a reason for them to be mad. Ludo Wu continued explaining to the confused Barcia:<br/>
"However, we can’t enter the city without an entry pass. They only allow ten other members who are not taking part in the conference to follow. That’s toying with us."<br/>
The Forest’s Edge denizens were planning to have tens of hunters guard the conference members. The tribal chiefs and a few others would take part in the conference, while the hunters would stand guard outside and rush in if something untoward happened.<br/>
"Hmm… Are they wary about us bringing Zuro Tsun and the others to the conference?"<br/>
"Hmmp! That makes more sense, compared to his illness just happening to worsen!"<br/>
However, Jimon only emphasized that Pyschkurewuss’ health was ailing and that the conference didn’t need so many guards. It was like saying they would be traitors if we didn’t accept this condition.<br/>
"The other requirement is more ludicrous. That damned aristocrat said that Asuta has to attend to the conference!"<br/>
Ryada Wu’s eyes went wide.<br/>
"Let Asuta join the conference? Isn’t this a conference between Pyschkurewuss and the Forest’s Edge tribal chiefs? It has nothing to do with Asuta."<br/>
"How would I know!? They are always making weird demands!"<br/>
Ludo Wu yelled as he stomped the ground.<br/>
I was the calmest of the lot and decided to explain on his behalf:<br/>
"According to them, they think my origins is a problem. There are no precedents of people from overseas being accepted as citizens, so they want to deal with this carefully or something."<br/>
I still haven’t grasped the rules of this world, so it was difficult for me to understand what Jimon was implying.<br/>
Anyway, they probably felt that foreigners were not believers of the four gods in this continent and were of a different faith, so they had to be careful of letting them in.<br/>
<br/>
"Asuta is a denizen of Forest’s Edge! Asuta thinks so himself, and we have no objections either, who are they to tell us otherwise!?"<br/>
A few hours ago Ludo Wu said so on the streets of the Post Station Town. Jimon shook his head with a cold expression:<br/>
"Which is to say, is Asuta of the Fa house a citizen of the western god Selva?"<br/>
"Yes, I think so."<br/>
"Then prove it."<br/>
And, of course, I didn’t know what proof he was asking for.<br/>
Jimon nodded with satisfaction:<br/>
"It’s fine if you are from Semu or Jaguar; as long as you are not from Mahildra, the doors of Selva will be open to you. However… If you are not a citizen of Selva, we won’t permit you to live in the territory of Genos, which includes the Morga Forest’s Edge."<br/>
"… I’m sorry, I don’t understand what you mean."<br/>
"I see, that means you are not from this continent."<br/>
"Hold it! We don’t understand what you are saying either!?"<br/>
Jimon looked coldly at the rowdy Ludo Wu.<br/>
"Denizens of the Forest’s Edge, you didn’t learn our rules properly despite being citizens of Selva. It’s unbelievable, but this is the agreement between Marquis Genos and the Forest’s Edge tribal chief eight decades ago, so this isn’t the fault of anyone. On this continent, only the denizens of Forest’s Edge don’t know the rites of the gods."<br/>
"Hmmp! Asuta is…"<br/>
"We can distinguish the denizens of Forest’s Edge from their unique features. And Forest’s Edge has no need to interact with other citizens. But Asuta of the Fa house is a foreigner, but still claims to be a citizen of the western god and earns money on the western soil. If we leave him be, this might create poor precedence for other foreigners with dubious origins. That’s the concern of Count Turan."<br/>
Jimon continued coldly:<br/>
"This has nothing to do with Lady Lifuria’s mistake, and we can’t let Asuta of the Fa house roam freely. Since Asuta of the Fa house plans to live on as a Forest’s Edge denizen and be a citizen of Genos, he needs the approval of the Landlord Marstein."<br/>
"… The trouble caused by his daughter still isn’t settled yet, and you are picking a fight with this again?"<br/>
Finally Ai Fa said with an icy tone:<br/>
"Doesn’t that aristocrat Pyschkurewuss feel any shame about how shallow he is?"<br/>
"Watch your tongue, Ai Fa of the Fa house. Since the Count knows about Asuta of the Fa house, he won’t let the matter rest."<br/>
Things escalated so much that the guards were almost called on us.<br/>
If I didn’t mediate and told them: "Follow the instructions of the tribal chiefs!", they would have done something irrevocable. Ai Fa and Ludo Wu were furious.<br/>
"Anyway, that damn Pyschkurewuss wants to take the Tsun clan and Asuta for himself! It’s so obvious that it makes me laugh!"<br/>
Ludo Wu shouted again in front of the solemn Ryada Wu.<br/>
Ludo Wu was forthright and expressive, but he seldom got this angry.<br/>
"That would be a discussion for later. Pyschkurewuss must be afraid of the denizens of the Forest’s Edge bringing him to task. With a deadweight like me, the tribal chiefs won’t be able to act freely."<br/>
"That’s not important! We need to bring Yamiel Lei, Zwei, and the others there too! That damn Pyschkurewuss’ target must be Asuta, just like his daughter’s."<br/>
Ludo Wu eyes had turned completely into that of a hunter.<br/>
Ai Fa had a poker face, while Ludo Wu’s eyes were getting more sinister.<br/>
Ryada Wu said calmly: "… We have already informed the people in the Post Station Town about the kind of resolve we have made before going to this meeting. If word concerning that got into Pyschkurewuss’ ears, he would have been even more wary."<br/>
"And since Kaslan Lutim was sent to spread this news, that means… the tribal chiefs didn’t care if Pyschkurewuss would get wary. Or rather, they wanted to use this method to determine his true intentions."<br/>
"What the hell!? Isn’t it retarded to put ourselves at a disadvantage?"<br/>
"They probably think it’s not that crucial of a disadvantage. Anyway… There’s no point in us arguing here. Like what Asuta said, let’s wait for the tribal chiefs to make the decision."<br/>
However, it was a foregone conclusion.<br/>
The intention of the nobles was clear. Unless they had the intention of committing treason, the venue of the conference shouldn’t matter, and we just needed ten guards… The denizens of Forest’s Edge were powerless to defy these instructions. It was the same for their instructions about me.<br/>
Ai Fa and Ludo Wu got so angry because they knew this. Two days before the conference, Pyschkurewuss finally showed his true nature.<br/>
Anyway, there was no point arguing without the tribal chiefs, so we decided to focus on the work before us.<br/>
All the hunters except for Ai Fa and Ludo Wu left, and everyone else walked into the kitchen. Rimee Wu was rostered for kitchen duty today and was grilling poitan by herself in the kitchen.<br/>
"Why are Ludo and Ai Fa so angry?"<br/>
Rimee Wu tilted her head puzzledly, and Ludo Wu explained to her loudly again. Meanwhile, I started cutting the meat.<br/>
And Barcia who also joined us today gave her greetings.<br/>
"You sure are calm despite being the subject."<br/>
"Yes, I will just follow the instructions of the tribal chiefs. Because I’m the one who caused so much trouble for everyone, which pains me… Still, I don’t want to say something self-deprecating like, ‘If I wasn’t here’."<br/>
"Fufu. I didn’t expect you to be so calm."<br/>
"That’s not true. I feel angry and uneasy on the inside."<br/>
But Ai Fa got mad on my behalf, and, for some reason, I was calm while being apologetic.<br/>
Anyway, this wasn’t my problem alone. This was a shared problem between me who wished to be a member of the Forest’s Edge and the denizens who accepted me. So I wanted to think about this together with everyone else in the Forest’s Edge and choose the most adequate solution.<br/>
"I’m really surprised that you don’t know about the rites of the gods. So there are tribes in the continent who don’t know about this."<br/>
Barcia then spread her muscular right arm out to the side and placed her left hand over her heart.<br/>
"I, Barcia of Marsala, do solemnly swear that I’m a devotee of the western god Selva… That’s how it is."<br/>
"I see. That’s enough to prove that I’m a westerner?"<br/>
"That’s right, isn’t that simple? However… If you mess around with this rite, your soul would get torn into four when you die. Be it royalty or bandits, no one will make a farce of this vow."<br/>
Barcia put down her arm with a smile.<br/>
"Well, unless you are close to Mahildra, you won’t have the chance to prove your faith. Even Kamyua Yost, who has the appearance of a northerner, rarely has a chance to prove his identity."<br/>
"Oh, I see."<br/>
If Shumimaru married into the Forest’s Edge, he couldn’t call himself a man of Semu any more.<br/>
If he concealed his identity and continued doing business with Mahildra, he would get exposed if anyone demanded him to prove his identity.<br/>
So changing one’s faith was such an important matter.<br/>
As for me, I needed to resolve myself to be a citizen of the western god Selva.<br/>
Fortunately, I was an atheist back home. My mother’s funeral was conducted in a Buddhist fashion, but, honestly speaking, I wasn’t sure which sect or style it was. I felt uneasy for someone like me to follow the faith of an unknown god… But I had no choice since I couldn’t be a part of Forest’s Edge if I didn’t do so.<br/>
However, the denizens of Forest’s Edge didn’t have such a custom, which means… The landlord of Genos didn’t have intention of treating them as fellow citizens right from the beginning?<br/>
Or maybe, the tribal chiefs of the Forest’s Edge eight decades ago didn’t care about this rite at all.<br/>
However, Forest’s Edge denizens were from the southern kingdom of Jaguar. Grandma Jiba who was from that time period should know about the rites of the gods. Or did they lose this knowledge after settling down in the Forest’s Edge?<br/>
The Forest’s Edge denizens are really an incredible tribe.<br/>
I thought with a wry smile.<br/>
To be fair, I was much stranger than them. For convenience sake, I was treated like someone from overseas, even though I was transported here from another world.<br/>
I already died once, crushed by debris in a burning building. The pain I felt couldn’t be my imagination, and everything about me couldn’t be explained with common sense. Despite all that, I still stumbled along with my second lease on life.<br/>
I should be dead, so why was I here as if I was still living? Why was I able to converse with others in this different world? Why did I suffer this strange turn of fate… There was no way of knowing, and I could only stay on here.<br/>
I still decided to become a denizen of Forest’s Edge… as a member of the Fa house, together with Ai Fa.<br/>
I already died once, so I couldn’t return to my original world.<br/>
However, I didn’t fell into despair because I met Ai Fa.<br/>
In order to hold on to this happiness, I was ready to face any hardships.<br/>
Since Pyschkurewuss was picking on me, I had to do my best to regain my position.<br/>
While I was thinking about that, I finished cutting all the meat for the "Myam-roasted meat".<br/>
"Alright, let’s start preparing dinner."<br/>
When she heard what I said, Rimee Wu turned her head:<br/>
"Asuta, are we going to make soup today? What soup should we make?"<br/>
Fortunately, Rimee Wu wasn’t affected by Ludo Wu’s words at all. "Just leave everything to Papa Donda!" She had complete confidence in her clan head. Ludo Wu was soothed by her and leaned against the wall with a sour face.<br/>
"Well, I plan to make a dish with karon milk today. That thing I brought over on my wagon."<br/>
I already kept the karon milk I bought from Yang in jars and stowed them away in the food store. After one night, the cream should have floated to the top, so I could use the nyuushi and skimmed milk to make soup.<br/>
"Sorry, Asuta, can I come over and help a little later?"<br/>
Leina Wu was busy making meat patties. I promised to teach her how to handle karon milk today.<br/>
"Yes, there’s no need to rush. I still need to do some research."<br/>
The leftover oil from yesterday was still in the kitchen.<br/>
I already sealed it as tightly as possible with fake rubber tree leaves, but the animal oil that had been used could not be kept back into the jar again. It could still be used a few more times before the oil turned sour, so I decided to use it for my cooking research.<br/>
Luckily, I have plenty of ingredients to fry.<br/>
Yesterday, other than the "Kiba cutlet", I also made "Minced kiba cutlet". Today, I would try to make a third deep-fried dish.<br/>
I started a fire in the stove and cooked the chachi I prepared ahead of time on it. I then started mincing the tenderloin and belly meat.<br/>
Ai Fa said softly: "… Hamburg steak?"<br/>
"No, this is another dish."<br/>
When she heard my answer, she closed her eyes and said: "I see."<br/>
"If this isn’t hamburg steak, then what is it? And you are adding in chachi too?"<br/>
Ludo Wu who had finally calmed down looked at the pot curiously. Speaking of which, Ludo Wu liked chachi.<br/>
"Yes, this is a dish I’m researching for sale. This is called a croquette. If you don’t mind… Ludo Wu, would you like to try?"<br/>
"Can I?"<br/>
Ludo Wu’s eyes started to shine, and Rimee Wu shouted unhappily: "That’s too sly!"<br/>
"Why are you only letting Ludo eat it? Rimee wants to try too!"<br/>
"Oh, sorry. I was planning to taste it myself, so I only prepared a single portion."<br/>
I might be overthinking it, but since I would be serving "Kiba cutlet" for tomorrow’s dinner, I didn’t want them to try deep fried food on consecutive days.<br/>
I let Ludo Wu sample this because he got really mad for my sake, so I wanted to thank him a little. But Rimee Wu looked very displeased.<br/>
"Look, like I said yesterday, eating deep fried food every day is not good for the body. Rimee Wu’s body is still small, so you have to pay more attention to this."<br/>
"Ludo is a runt too!"<br/>
"You are the runt!"<br/>
I accidentally started a fight between siblings.<br/>
I looked timidly back at Ai Fa, but she said preemptively: "I’m not eating."<br/>
"If it tastes too good, just a taste test won’t satisfy me."<br/>
I thought her facial expression was saying: "I don’t just want to eat your food", but that was probably just my delusion.<br/>
"A-Anyways, I plan to cook ‘Kiba cutlets’ for dinner tomorrow, so please wait until then. This dish will just be made for sale."<br/>
"But Asuta’s cooking is definitely yummy!"<br/>
"No, I fail a lot too, you just didn’t get to see it. If you really want to try… How about I get you to try my dishes next time?"<br/>
Rimee Wu puffed her cheeks and looked at me with brows low: "Really? You are not tricking me? It’s a promise then."<br/>
"Yes, I promise."<br/>
"Ughh… Alright, I will bear with it this time."<br/>
Rimee Wu seemed really disappointed as she started grilling poitan again. Ludo Wu snickered with a triumphant face. What a complicated relationship between siblings…<br/>
I focused on the task at hand again.<br/>
First, I minced the aria and added in a little animal oil.<br/>
When the food turned soft, I added minced meat and seasoned with salt and Pico leaves. I then scooped up the cooked chachi and mashed it with a krilee stick while it was still hot. I then mixed the other ingredients together with the chachi and melded them into balls. The preparation was complete.<br/>
Next, similar to yesterday, I coated it with fuwano powder, kimyusu egg, as well as baked fuwano crumbs and then deep fried them with animal oil.<br/>
On top of that, I planned to make a seasoning sauce too.<br/>
For the denizens of Forest’s Edge who ate only salt and jerky, oil and excessive salt were unnecessary. However, the people in the Post Station Town who preserved their meat with salt instead of Pico leaves liked their food salty, and they needed to take in that much salt too. Hence, I decided to use more Tau sauce for seasoning.<br/>
I came up with the recipe for this dish when I was abducted into the Count Turan manor. I heated some minced tarapa and aria in a pot, and after cooling it a little, I added in Tau sauce and fuwano powder. The sourness of tarapa, the sweetness of aria, the thick texture of fuwano, and soy sauce-like Tau sauce combined together to make something similar to Worcestershire sauce.<br/>
It would be even closer with some mamaria vinegar, but that could only be purchased in the city. I had to make this dish with ingredients available in the Post Station Town.<br/>
"… Asuta, this dish is interesting too."<br/>
Leina Wu looked sadly my way as she cooked her tarapa sauce.<br/>
"Yes, I see. If I manage to sell this dish in an inn, I will teach you how to make it."<br/>
Compared to kiba, a dish that used more chachi was more suited to the taste of the people in the Post Station Town. However, the townsfolk consumed less oil than Forest’s Edge denizens, so I needed to consult the innkeepers.<br/>
In any case, let’s make the dishes first.<br/>
When the oil was heated to the same temperature as yesterday, I added the ingredient into the oil.<br/>
The nice crackling sound came from the kitchen today too.<br/>
The animal oil was still clear, so it could be used for another time or two. But without any strainer, it was a pain to remove any impurities.<br/>
By the way, Dell still hasn’t visited the Post Station Town yet.<br/>
Since I would be cooking deep fried food from now on, I wanted strainers and other cooking tools. However, there wasn’t anything similar being sold in the Post Station Town, so I had to ask Dell who dealt with steelware for help.<br/>
But Pyschkurewuss is an important business partner to Dell’s father, so he probably doesn’t want to have any dealings with the Forest’s Edge.<br/>
If Pyschkurewuss fell into ruins, Dell and her father’s efforts would be wasted. Would they get mad at me if that happened?<br/>
The friendship we forged over time was hanging in the air. What would happen to the relationship I built up with that girl? With a sense of loneliness, I scooped up the golden brown croquette and placed it onto the makeshift strainer I made with skewers.<br/>
"It smells delicious, what’s it called?"<br/>
"Well, this isn’t really a meat dish, so the Forest’s Edge denizens might not like it."<br/>
But I was thinking if this could be served as snacks in the Post Station Town.<br/>
By the way, I was also wondering whether the denizens of Forest’s Edge should get accustomed to eating more side dishes.<br/>
Last night, I tried serving tino shreds and tarapa salad, and boiled gigo as side dishes for the "Kiba cutlet". The dishes I made contained more salt, sugar, and oil than dinner on previous nights, so I needed to increase the amount of vegetables.<br/>
Ludo Wu will probably like dishes that use the potato-like chachi.<br/>
I thought as I added some sauce to the croquette that had been drained of all excess oil.<br/>
"Alright, it’s done. It’s still hot, so be careful not to get burned."<br/>
I put the croquette onto another plate, split it in half, and offered half of it to Ludo Wu.<br/>
And then popped the other half into my mouth… The incredibly nostalgic texture of the croquette spread in my mouth.<br/>
The potato-like chachi was really alluring. Kiba which was usually the main character was sidelined but still contributed its chewy texture to the dish. The crispy feeling of the fuwano powder was outstanding too.<br/>
Did my father know how well animal oil meshes with deep-fried food? At least, I didn’t know before this.<br/>
Since it was animal oil, it should be viscous, but that wasn’t so. Instead, it had a refreshing aftertaste and a delectable sweetness.<br/>
Anyway, the croquette tasted as good as the cutlet.<br/>
This was good enough for sale. I exhaled in relief with a deep sense of satisfaction… And then someone suddenly grabbed me by the chest.<br/>
"Huh? What’s the matter, Ludo Wu?"<br/>
Ludo Wu leaned in close with a serious face:<br/>
"… It tastes too good."<br/>
"Oh, is that so. That’s great…"<br/>
"This is the best so far! Compared to steak, hamburg steak, and vegetable stew, this is the best! What is this!?"<br/>
"Well, I already said that it’s called croquette…"<br/>
"Make more for me! This bit isn’t enough at all!"<br/>
Ludo Wu who was smaller than me in stature but had the arm strength of a hunter shook me violently.<br/>
"Alright, but the nutrition of deep-fried food isn’t too balanced… So, let’s do that next time?"<br/>
"When is next time!? Tomorrow!? The day after tomorrow!?"<br/>
He rocked me so hard that my vision was turning white. Like mild amnesia or a mild concussion.<br/>
Ai Fa rescued me at this moment:<br/>
"Ludo Wu, don’t mess around too much."<br/>
A calm voice came, and the pressure at my chest disappeared. Ludo Wu’s figure moved slowly away.<br/>
However, the world was still rocking.<br/>
No, what was rocking was that thing in my skull.<br/>
A strong force and warmth slowly enveloped my crumbling body, and a sweet scent entered the depth of my consciousness.<br/>
"Asuta is as weak as women and children. You can’t treat him so violently."<br/>
"But, that thing is too tasty!"<br/>
Ludo Wu shouted like a child.<br/>
I could see the light flickering in his eyes, and his voice seemed so far away.<br/>
"Just calm down for now. No matter how tasty that dish is, it’s not healthy if you keep eating it. He just told you that."<br/>
However, Ai Fa’s voice was so close. From right behind my ears.<br/>
That was only natural, since Ai Fa was holding my body from behind. My legs were devoid of strength, and I was resting my entire weight onto Ai Fa, with her arms around my chest.<br/>
"Uwah, sorry! I’m fine now, Ai Fa!"<br/>
"You are not fine. You can’t use any strength at all."<br/>
Ai Fa said impatiently and hugged me even tighter.<br/>
"But, Ai Fa, you will understand after trying it! It’s really good!"<br/>
"Everyone has their own preferences. We already discussed that when we ate steaks."<br/>
"Then, for me, this is the best tasting dish!"<br/>
"You have to bear with it then. Just think of this as a trial to turn Asuta’s prowess into good medicine."<br/>
Ai Fa spoke to him over my shoulder.<br/>
At this moment, Rimee Wu interjected: "How sly!"<br/>
"If it tastes that good, Rimee wants to eat it too! Asuta, make one for Rimee next time, okay?"<br/>
"Yes, I will."<br/>
"I want to try too. Even more so since it’s for sale."<br/>
"Really now, I also want a bite."<br/>
Shela Wu and Barcia also joined in.<br/>
I was terribly embarrassed as Ai Fa was hugging me from behind right now.<br/>
Finally, Leina Wu also looked at me grudgingly: "… Really, how sly."<br/>
I took a deep sigh, and Ai Fa whispered in my ear: "Don’t worry. We have to bear with it sometimes to turn Asuta’s strength into good medicine."<br/>
"Ah, yes…"<br/>
"I’m enduring it, so Ludo Wu has to do the same. However… If you belittle what we are bearing with, you will suffer the same retribution."<br/>
She held me so tightly that I felt I was going to get crushed. Was this my retribution for not making hamburg steak for my house head after such a long time.<br/>
Anyway, the conference was just a day and a half away.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
3<br/>
The next day, 14th of the White Month, the day before the conference with Pyschkurewuss, a heavy atmosphere hung over the town. News spread by Zashuma was slowly making its round throughout the Post Station Town.<br/>
The Forest’s Edge denizens suspected Pyschkurewuss of being a criminal and would hold a conference with Pyschkurewuss to determine the punishment for Zattsu Tsun and the other villains. If both sides couldn’t reach an agreement, there was no telling what might happen. This insider information had become common knowledge within the Post Station Town.<br/>
And now, I have decided to close the stall tomorrow, the 15th. I would also stop the catering for the inns tomorrow; instead, I sold them three days worth of fresh meat. What would happen two days later would depend on tomorrow’s conference.<br/>
Yang’s business was still booming. I heard he sold 200 portions on his opening day. It was a mini snack that cost 1 red copper plate, but a normal stall would only sell 50 or so portions, so his sales were amazing.<br/>
From what I saw on the way to the inns, Yang’s stall was doing as good as yesterday.<br/>
However, the crowd was a little different. The ratio between men and women was about even yesterday, but the number of women increased today.<br/>
There were also many more kids. Since the snack was sweet, this was the natural outcome. The colorful wrapping also attracted women and children. There were few easterners and southerners today too, and I couldn’t see any drunk westerner ruffians either.<br/>
On the other hand, the patrons to my stall were the complete opposite of this crowd. So those who didn’t visit my stall had all gone over here. I decided to remember this for future reference.<br/>
In any case, Yang’s business was doing great.<br/>
And also, three inns and four stalls had started selling dishes made with grilled poitan.<br/>
The food was the same as usual, but the fuwano was replaced by the poitan. With the help of the Post Station Town’s ruler, the Count Satolas house, Polarse had roped in these shops to switch to poitan.<br/>
They could buy the poitan at its original price and make it into powder form, and would be taught how to add color to the grilled poitan. This was a very unorthodox sales method.<br/>
I could spot the stalls with booming business when walking through the marketplace. Adding color to dishes with neenon and nanaru was rare, and the novelty of cooking poitan this way made these stalls popular. And, of course, Yang’s now famous stall was also using grilled poitan, which had a big influence on this too.<br/>
The stalls that agreed to adopt poitan could also learn how to make nyuushi. The stalls selling grilled poitan could use nyuushi too, making them even more popular.<br/>
They really covered all the corners.<br/>
Kamyua Yost probably didn’t expect nyuushi to make its debut here, which was part of Polarse’s strategy.<br/>
If this went on, reversing the status of poitan and fuwano would no longer be a dream. Like what Polarse said, poitan was cheaper than fuwano, so neither the seller nor buyer had a reason to turn down this trade.<br/>
"News of this situation should have reached Pyschkurewuss by now. He might just laugh it off for now, but if he finds out that the Taliem and Satolas houses are working together, he won’t be able to keep his calm."<br/>
Zashuma said with a laugh.<br/>
At most, this was just a set up to pressure Pyschkurewuss, and more time would be needed to yield tangible effects. This wasn’t enough to cause substantial losses to Pyschkurewuss. However, our goal was to give him some pressure by letting him know "your wealth won’t last forever"— and digging a hole in his sturdy wall.<br/>
This was a plan to keep the people around Pyschkurewuss in check.<br/>
Right now, Count Taliem had given silent consent towards his son’s action. While it wasn’t clear how enthusiastic the Count Satolas house was in this plan, they still provided aid to Polarse. Pyschkurewuss’ claw was slowly being torn out.<br/>
"… We will finally go into the city tomorrow."<br/>
After the operation hours were over, we headed to Uncle Dora’s stall to procure vegetables. An incredibly stern face welcomed us.<br/>
"The conference will start at noon, correct? Then, it will probably be finished by 2pm to 3pm, right?"<br/>
"Well, I don’t really know either."<br/>
"It shouldn’t last until dusk, right? If Asuta and the others still don’t come out from the city gates, it will be big trouble…"<br/>
Uncle Dora’s smile looked a little angry.<br/>
"I will definitely go to the city gates. The easterners and southerners won’t sit by idly either."<br/>
"I see, but before things escalate to that extent, we will do the best choice and return safely."<br/>
"Yes, but I will still worry! What worries me the most is that Asuta needs to attend too!"<br/>
Uncle Dora looked depressed again. He was worried about the denizens of Forest’s Edge destroying Genos and also our safety too.<br/>
And, of course, that’s because the tribal chiefs of Forest’s Edge accepted all of Pyschkurewuss’ terms. Donda Wu’s brother Ryada Wu said that Donda Wu already expected Pyschkurewuss to raise these terms.<br/>
During dinner last night, Donda Wu said: "Bringing hunters along as escorts, as Kaslan Lutim explained, is to display our resolve in a simple to understand manner. Depending on how they react, we will respond with force. It is a way of intimidating them."<br/>
"They didn’t seem to understand the reason why we planned to bring so many men along. But they do know the reason why we are bringing the Tsun clan members with us, and have a larger reaction to that… So we have to be ready that they might resort to violence."<br/>
"So, what should we do? Accept their unreasonable terms?"<br/>
In response to the unhappy Ludo Wu, Donda Wu showed a feral smile:<br/>
"Do we have any reason to reject them? Graff Zaza and I will be there. So will Dali Sauti and Kaslan Lutim. Even if we have a bunch of dead weights, we won’t lose to them. We will also have ten escorts with us."<br/>
"But your blades will be confiscated at the venue, right? And fully armed guards will be there…"<br/>
I couldn’t help interjecting, and Donda Wu turned to me without any hesitation:<br/>
"If we need to use force, we can just take the weapons of those soldiers. And… We are not the only ones with deadweight."<br/>
Blue flame of fury was burning in Donda Wu’s eyes.<br/>
"Before the foolish city soldiers can hurt our tribemates, I will wring Pyschkurewuss’ neck. If they still resist… Then the fight will get real."<br/>
I couldn’t imagine Donda Wu and Kaslan Lutim losing to those soldiers.<br/>
Just like Uncle Dora feared, the worst thing would be Pyschkurewuss underestimating the prowess of Forest’s Edge hunters, which would lead to tragedy.<br/>
"Anyway, we won’t act without provocation. If we have to use force, whether the laws of Genos would fault us or Pyschkurewuss would be the most crucial factors for us."<br/>
With that, Donda Wu looked my way:<br/>
"So I won’t have any problem with the Tsun clan people and you attending. Use your glib tongue to defend yourself, Asuta of the Fa house."<br/>
"Alright, I understand."<br/>
Ai Fa nodded and said quietly: "Wait."<br/>
"I will comply with the decision of the Forest’s Edge tribal chiefs. But… If you are bringing Asuta along, let me go with him too. As the head of the Fa house, I won’t back down from this."<br/>
"… The six attendees have been decided. Three tribal chiefs and three followers… Kaslan Lutim and the heads of the Fou and Bemu houses."<br/>
"…"<br/>
"However, the other side is the one who raised this new condition. Tell Pyschkurewuss that if he wants Asuta to attend the conference, then a permit for the head of the Fa house to join should be granted too."<br/>
"… Much obliged."<br/>
Ai Fa lowered her head.<br/>
And so, it had been decided that Ai Fa and I would be joining the conference tomorrow.<br/>
"Asuta-niichan, you must return safely tomorrow, okay?"<br/>
I nodded to the teary Tara and her father:<br/>
"I will definitely return safe and sound. I promise that I will do my best."<br/>
I could neither wield a blade nor take on any responsibilities. But I believed my tribemates who would put their life and pride on the line, and had to do my very best.<br/>
And so, we bade Uncle Dora farewell and left the Post Station Town.<br/>
The Forest’s Edge settlement awaited me, and one more major event was coming up before the finale tomorrow.<br/>
"Yo, long time no see, Asuta and Ai Fa!"<br/>
When we reached the Wu clan village, someone greeted us.<br/>
It was Rau Lei whom I haven’t seen in four days.<br/>
"Oh, Rau Lei. What brings you here today?"<br/>
"What do you mean?. I brought Yamiel Lei here. I lent my Totos to you, so we walked here."<br/>
"Ahh, the head of the Lei house walked here personally?"<br/>
Before I got abducted, Rau Lei often dropped by the Fa house with Yamiel Lei on his Totos. He was faster than Dan Lutim.<br/>
"My reliable kins are all at home! And I don’t want to hand this job over to anyone else."<br/>
Rau Lei’s eyes were like a hunting dog.<br/>
"Asuta, you want to treat Yamiel Lei and the others to dinner you will be making personally, right? I want to join too, will that be fine?"<br/>
"Huh? I don’t mind, but shouldn’t you ask Donda Wu about this?"<br/>
"Donda Wu told me to ask you! So you agree?"<br/>
Rau Lei smiled happily:<br/>
"Thank you! After the harvest festival, I have been itching to eat Asuta’s cooking again! The women in the Lei house have improved their cooking skills, but they still can’t compare to Asuta!"<br/>
"Yes, I will work hard to not disappoint you."<br/>
When I asked him where Yamiel Lei was, a loud voice came from behind: "Hey, Asuta!"<br/>
I turned back with Gilulu’s reins in hand and saw Dan Lutim’s figure.<br/>
"It’s been so long! I have a request…"<br/>
"Ah, okay. If it is about dinner, do you need to tell Donda Wu about it?"<br/>
"What! You saw through what I was thinking!?"<br/>
I smiled weakly.<br/>
Kaslan Lutim and a woman walked forth from behind the surprised Dan Lutim.<br/>
"Asuta, you have returned. Ludo Wu… I brought Aura here."<br/>
Zwei’s mother, Zuro Tsun ex-wife and now a member of Lutim house. Her brown hair was cut to shoulder length, and she had delicate facial features. She was so young that I couldn’t tell she was Zwei’s mother, but her expression was lackluster, and a shadow hung over her eyes.<br/>
"It’s been a while, Aura. Zwei and Emma Min Lutim are walking over and should be here soon."<br/>
"… Is that so…"<br/>
The last time I saw her was at Tay Tsun’s burial in the forest. My impression of her had not changed since that time, and I wasn’t sure if I should be happy or worried.<br/>
"There is still some time before dinner. Where should I let Aura wait?"<br/>
Dan Lutim asked Ludo Wu, but the one answering was Rau Lei.<br/>
"I sent Yamiel Lei to that empty house over there. I want to let her chat with her family."<br/>
"Ah, you mean Mida? Or…"<br/>
"Zuro Tsun, Diga, and Doddo. Right now, Graff Zaza is at the door guarding them."<br/>
"Then you should go there too."<br/>
When she heard what Dan Lutim said, Aura said with her shoulders trembling:<br/>
"… I understand… By your leave…"<br/>
"Don’t be so formal! You are prohibited from meeting them as your relationship has been broken. Hence, this is a rare chance for you to talk to them, right?"<br/>
"Then, I will talk to Graff Zaza and the others."<br/>
Led by Rau Lei, Aura headed to the empty house that I often lodged in.<br/>
As he watched them leave, Dan Lutim showed a rare worried expression.<br/>
"Well… Aura and Zwei have already joined the Lutim house for more than a month. But they still haven’t opened their heart to me. I want to bestow the Lutim family name to them soon too…"<br/>
"That incident with Zattsu Tsun left a deeper impression on them. Don’t be hasty, the important thing is for them to calm down."<br/>
Kaslan Lutim answered calmly, then turned to me and said:<br/>
"By the way, Asuta, aside from my father, can you prepare a few more portions for dinner?"<br/>
"Huh? Well, that’s fine. There was already 20-odd people, so adding a few more wouldn’t be a problem…"<br/>
"Then I will be counting on you. Are five more portions fine with you?"<br/>
"No problem. But who are the five?"<br/>
"Dali Sauti, Graff Zaza, the heads of the Fou and Bemu houses, and me. Which are the people participating in the conference tomorrow."<br/>
Kaslan Lutim then smiled:<br/>
"I heard Donda Wu wants Zuro Tsun and the others to try Asuta’s cooking, so Dali Sauti asked if the other conference attendees should join in too. Graff Zaza brought Zuro Tsun’s group over personally. He didn’t return home in order to discuss with Dali Sauti about tomorrow’s matters."<br/>
Dali Sauti said during the harvest festival that Graff Zaza should try Asuta’s dish. To accept the delicious dish, learn the strength and joy the Fa house and Wu clan had obtained… If he wanted to refute the actions of the Fa house, he needed to understand the situation completely.<br/>
"If you have no objections, I plan to use the Totos I borrowed from the Wu clan to inform the Fou and Bemu houses. Dali Sauti will come over to the Wu clan after finishing his hunting duties."<br/>
"Hmmp! You laid out such schemes and wanted to exclude me alone! How sly of you, Kaslan!"<br/>
Kaslan Lutim apologized to the fuming Dan Lutim with a smile: "I’m very sorry."<br/>
"I was thinking that father’s appetite is bigger than normal people, and am worried that it might be too much of a burden for Asuta. I didn’t have any ill intentions."<br/>
"What!? Did you hear that, Asuta!? He ignores his father after marrying his wife!"<br/>
"This has nothing to do with Emma Min."<br/>
I couldn’t help laughing.<br/>
But with so many additional guests, I couldn’t stand by idly.<br/>
"I will start cooking dinner then. Dan Lutim, can you help me inform Donda Wu?"<br/>
"Okay, will do!"<br/>
I didn’t know what would happen to the business the day after tomorrow, so I bought enough ingredients ahead of time. I could use them first and deal with it later.<br/>
But preparing food for seven more people was quite a substantial, so I need to deal with that quickly.<br/>
"Then, how many portions should we make?"<br/>
Leina Wu asked as she walked to the kitchen.<br/>
"Twelve members of the Wu clan main house, Yamiel Lei’s group of seven, Ai Fa, Barcia and me, Shin Wu’s family of six, so there are 28."<br/>
Shela Wu and Tali Wu wanted to help too, so we made their family’s share too.<br/>
"Including the newcomers, there are 35 people. Since there are some with larger appetite than normal, we should prepare about 45 portions to be safe."<br/>
"Forty five portions… That’s a mini banquet."<br/>
"Yes, but we can do it by working together."<br/>
There were about three hours left. But we would be taking the day off tomorrow, so everyone could focus on making dinner. So, theoretically, there shouldn’t be any problem.<br/>
"Ahh, welcome back! Asuta, the poitan is done!"<br/>
Rimee Wu and the others had already started working in the kitchen.<br/>
"Thank you. But there are a lot more unexpected guests, so can you prepare another ten portions?"<br/>
"Ten portions? Understood!"<br/>
Rimee Wu was about to run off to the food store when Sati Lei Wu called out to her:<br/>
"Rimee is good at cooking, so you should help Asuta. I will grill the poitan."<br/>
"Thank you, Sati Lei Wu."<br/>
"Don’t mention it."<br/>
Sati Lei Wu smiled gently:<br/>
"You need to make the other dishes in the kitchen, right? Then I will grill the poitan at Shin Wu’s place."<br/>
Sati Lei Wu wasn’t as good as Rimee Wu in cooking, but no one was as considerate as her. With so many skilled members with me, I had nothing to worry about.<br/>
"Then the work schedule would be the as we agreed on yesterday, I will be counting on everyone. I will fill in for Sati Lei Wu here."<br/>
The ones cooking would be the women of the Wu clan main house and Shin Wu’s house, eight in total. The one absent was Grandma Ditto Min who had to tend to Kota Wu.<br/>
"Ahh, sorry for being so sudden, but I plan to include ribs in the menu."<br/>
"Ribs? But why?"<br/>
Shela Wu asked baffledly, and I said with a smile:<br/>
"Because Dan Lutim will be coming, so I want to include a ribs dish. No matter how luxurious dinner might be, Dan Lutim will be sad if there aren’t any ribs."<br/>
Shela Wu smiled, and Lala Wu also agreed: "That’s right."<br/>
"We are already making so many dishes, will adding another dish be fine?"<br/>
"We can decrease the quantity of the other dishes. It will take more effort, but we should be able to make it in time."<br/>
"Fufu. It’s fine, we will do whatever Asuta says."<br/>
Lala Wu had a good reason to worry; we were already planning to cook eight different dishes.<br/>
There were a lot of people attending, and we needed to let Zuro Tsun understand what the Fa house was doing too. I thought we should present the food we were selling in the Post Station Town to them.<br/>
Hence, today’s menu was— "Kiba burgers", "Myam-roasted meat", "Braised kiba", "Meat chachi", "Kiba sauté- Arrabbiata style", "Kiba cutlet", "Kiba Tau sauce soup", "Kiba meat karon milk stew", and "Kiba roast ribs", a total of nine dishes.<br/>
I delegated the "Kiba burgers", "Myam-roasted meat", and "Kiba Tau sauce soup" completely to Leina Wu and Shela Wu, and assigned the other dishes to the others as efficiently as possible.<br/>
"Alright then, I will return home and prepare the meat patties with my mother."<br/>
"Okay, I will be counting on you. Leina Wu, please make the vegetable stew. I will get the karon milk. Ai Fa… Can you help me move the pot?"<br/>
Ai Fa, Shela Wu, and I exited the kitchen together. However, Shela Wu who was walking in front of me stopped suddenly, and I ran into her.<br/>
"Darum Wu… You are back."<br/>
I could see Darum Wu over Shela Wu’s shoulder. His long black hair was tied behind him, there was a deep scar on his right cheek, and he was a hunter with eyes like a wolf… It was the second son of the Wu clan main house, Darum Wu.<br/>
He went to the Zaza house village for half a month in order to watch over Zuro Tsun and the others. Since Zuro Tsun and company had been sent to the Wu clan village, he came along with them.<br/>
"It’s been a while, Darum Wu… It’s great that you are safe."<br/>
"Yes."<br/>
Darum Wu nodded at Shela Wu and then stared at me with a fiery gaze. He then grabbed both my arms and pulled me along with him.<br/>
Ai Fa protested immediately, but Darum Wu brushed her off with: "I have business with Asuta of the Fa house."<br/>
"What business do you have with Asuta? Your violent actions…"<br/>
"I won’t act violently towards him. I will cut off my right arm if I go back against my words."<br/>
Darum Wu said these familiar lines as he pulled me far away from Ai Fa and the others.<br/>
After walking ten meters or so, we stopped. We were still within Ai Fa and the others’ sight, but far enough for them not to hear us.<br/>
I glanced their way and could see Shela Wu pulling the arm of Ai Fa who was trying to come towards us.<br/>
"L-Long time no see, Darum Wu."<br/>
To start, I greeted him normally.<br/>
Darum Wu let go of my hand and leaned in close.<br/>
"Asuta of the Fa house. Are you… retarded?"<br/>
"Huh? Well, I know that I’m bad with words…"<br/>
"Didn’t you tell me that you want to protect Ai Fa? And yet, you got caught by the enemy, what are you trying to do?" He glared at me from close up with his eyes shining with blue light. "You said you want to protect Ai Fa’s feelings, thoughts, and pride. Was all that just lip service? Are you staying with Ai Fa with so little resolve?"<br/>
My heart ached, and I was at a loss for words.<br/>
The rage in Darum Wu’s eyes burned more intensely as he came even nearer:<br/>
"I told you that I will end you if you fail to protect Ai Fa. But what should I do if you die before that happens?"<br/>
Darum Wu appeared to be suppressing the anger in his voice. But it seemed to have gotten the better of him because he grabbed my shoulders.<br/>
"Have you thought about what will happen to Ai Fa if she loses you? You already have a place deep in Ai Fa’s heart, do you want her to experience the despair of losing you?"<br/>
I thought I heard the sound of my shoulder blade cracking, but Darum Wu’s words hurt me even more.<br/>
"That’s what protecting Ai Fa means. Before worrying about Ai Fa dying in the forest, you have to stay by her side. If you don’t even understand that… Then, why did I…"<br/>
"I know! Or rather, I think I know."<br/>
I understood very clearly that nothing I say would be enough.<br/>
But I had to tell him what I thought.<br/>
"I might be too weak to even protect myself, but I want to stay by Ai Fa’s side… and get to know each other, and live together until the day we die. It might not be convincing after the mistake I made… But that is how I truly feel."<br/>
"…"<br/>
"This incident made me realize how weak I really am. But even so… I still want to be together with Ai Fa."<br/>
Darum Wu glared at me quietly and finally let go of my shoulders.<br/>
And he facepalmed himself as if he had an intense headache.<br/>
"… Please…"<br/>
"Huh?"<br/>
"Please, don’t make Ai Fa sad again."<br/>
Darum Wu said that quietly, turned, and walked away quickly. Ai Fa and Shela Wu jogged to my side.<br/>
"Hey, what was all that? Asuta, I don’t get that at all."<br/>
Ai Fa leaned in angrily to the same distance as Darum Wu just now.<br/>
"That time during the harvest festival, and today as well, why is that second son treating Asuta like that?"<br/>
"Well… He just berated me for getting captured by the enemy."<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Ai Fa didn’t accept my explanation and leaned in closer.<br/>
"That’s the fault of the hunters on guard duty. Why is he blaming Asuta?"<br/>
"That’s not true. No one else held me accountable for my mistakes, so I’m really thankful towards Darum Wu."<br/>
That was what I really felt.<br/>
Ai Fa twisted her lips in surprise and looked me in the eye just like Darum Wu did earlier.<br/>
"I still don’t get it. Asuta, whenever you meet that second son, you will get quiet."<br/>
"Yes, that might be so."<br/>
Ai Fa pulled away and pouted unhappily.<br/>
Shela Wu smiled beside her.<br/>
"I will head home then. I will be back after I finish making the meat patties."<br/>
"Alright. Oh… Thank you, Shela Wu."<br/>
Shela Wu who was about to turn away smiled again.<br/>
"You don’t need to thank me, Asuta. I’m just doing what I wanted to do…"<br/>
With that, Shela Wu turned and left.<br/>
I sighed softly and then slapped my face hard with my right hand.<br/>
"What are you doing, Asuta."<br/>
Ai Fa said with her eyes wide open.<br/>
"Nothing, I’m just cheering myself on. Well then… Please help me move this jar."<br/>
I smiled at Ai Fa.<br/>
Ai Fa frowned and put her hand on my face.<br/>
"That looks painful, Asuta."<br/>
"I’m fine, it didn’t hurt at all."<br/>
I took Ai Fa’s hand and headed towards the food store.<br/>
The sun that was between its peak and the horizon sunk slowly towards the west.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
4<br/>
The world was then shrouded in light purple.<br/>
It was dinner time.<br/>
And it was held in the plaza outside.<br/>
The Wu clan main house was big, but not large enough to house so many guests. There were already 26 people excluding the additional guests, so the plan was to host it outdoors all along.<br/>
We had bought everything we needed from the Post Station Town, such as the rugs on the ground and large plates for the dishes.<br/>
"They can be used for future banquets too, so we bought them."<br/>
The expenses were borne by Leina Wu, using the money she earned from her business.<br/>
The Wu clan had started working independently for seven days, so theoretically, their revenue should be about 2,700 red copper plates. The Wu clan didn’t need to pay for manpower and kiba meat, so their profit would be 70% of that.<br/>
This belonged to the Wu clan and wasn’t Leina Wu’s personal money, but Donda Wu didn’t object them spending money this way.<br/>
And so, a few large rugs were laid out in front of the Wu clan main house, with large plates containing all sorts of dishes placed on top. On the stone platform in the center was a pot of stew. Around it were the 35 participants of this dinner party.<br/>
Twelve members of the Wu clan main house, Shin Wu’s family of six and the Tsun clan’s seven. Ai Fa, Barcia, and I.<br/>
There were also seven additional guests, being Dan Lutim, Kaslan Lutim, Rau Lei, Dali Sauti, Graff Zaza, and the heads of the Fou and Bemu houses.<br/>
With everyone gathered, this was like a banquet.<br/>
But no one was laughing, and everyone had a serious face as the bonfire shone on them. Only Rimee Wu and the kids from Shin Wu’s house were beaming.<br/>
"Well then, let’s start the dinner…"<br/>
Donda Wu who was in the seat of honor announced in a deep voice:<br/>
"Tonight’s dinner is meaningful as it represents our life being extended for another night. Especially for the kin of the villain Zattsu Tsun."<br/>
The family members of Zattsu Tsun were lined up in a row in front of Donda Wu.<br/>
Zattsu Tsun’s son, Zuro Tsun, who was awaiting execution.<br/>
Diga and Doddo who didn’t belong to any house and were working in the Dom house to pay for their crimes and prison break.<br/>
Mida who had joined the Wu clan.<br/>
Yamiel Lei who was a part of the Lei house.<br/>
Aura and Zwei who joined the Lutim house.<br/>
The seven of them.<br/>
"Zattsu Tsun was the tribal chief of Forest’s Edge, but he committed countless crimes. Like you, we had no idea that he went so far as to commit banditry in disguise… For the past decade, you followed the unforgivable rules set by Zattsu Tsun and desecrated the Morga Forest."<br/>
Donda Wu swept his sharp gaze across them.<br/>
"Zattsu Tsun retired from his post as clan head and tribal chief due to his illness, and the new head forced the branch houses to comply with these unforgivable rules…"<br/>
Zuro Tsun hung his head meekly and didn’t move.<br/>
"Zuro Tsun’s three sons acted recklessly without shame in the Forest’s Edge and Post Station Town."<br/>
Diga and Doddo also lowered their heads.<br/>
Mida looked at the food before him with a growling stomach and tried his best to keep his eyes on Donda Wu.<br/>
"The women didn’t have the strength to stop the actions of the retarded men, and some even closed off their hearts…"<br/>
Aura listened quietly to Donda Wu with her knees closed.<br/>
"Some didn’t even realize their wrongdoings…"<br/>
Zwei averted her face irately.<br/>
"Some even attempted to bring further chaos to the Forest’s Edge."<br/>
Yamiel Lei had a poker face.<br/>
She was the only one looking up at Donda Wu.<br/>
"However, your punishments had already been decided. Zuro Tsun who inherited the position of clan head and tribal chief will pay for his sins with his life. The other members would be stripped of their family names. Diga and Doddo who submitted to Zattsu Tsun even after joining the Dom house, the punishment for your transgression is being carried out, but the Forest’s Edge won’t increase your punishment any further."<br/>
Donda Wu then hold out a clenched fist before them:<br/>
"Tomorrow, you will be standing before that aristocrat Pyschkurewuss; he wishes to increase the terms of your punishment. Use your own mouth and explain yourself to him with your own words. If your conscience is clear, we will help you as fellow tribemates of the Forest’s Edge, but what will be put on trial will be your honor and conviction. If you don’t have any pride or conviction as a denizen of Forest’s Edge, we can’t help you. Keep that in mind."<br/>
No one responded.<br/>
Donda Wu slowly put down his arm:<br/>
"There are also some in the Forest’s Edge who have started a business in the Post Station Town to bring wealth to our people. And, of course, I’m talking about Ai Fa and Asuta of the Fa house. Right now, only the kin of the Wu clan, the Fou house, and the Sudora house are aiding them. But the fact remains that they are earning a lot of copper plates."<br/>
"…"<br/>
"…"<br/>
"Zattsu Tsun assaulted the townsfolk and desecrated the Morga mountain in his attempt to gain more wealth. He set off on the wrong path in his pursuit of greater strength and fortune and defied the Genos nobles. Then… What about us? Is the path taken by the Fa house and Wu clan the right one? I think that you, as Zattsu Tsun’s family, have the right to understand this. This dinner was held for this very purpose."<br/>
"…"<br/>
"…"<br/>
"…"<br/>
"The opening speech is too long, that foolish old man there is about to riot."<br/>
Donda Wu chuckled, and Dan Lutim seated to my left said unhappily:<br/>
"I don’t know who you are talking about, but the food is getting cold, Donda Wu!"<br/>
Donda Wu closed his eyes and started his pre-meal prayer without any warning: "I give thanks to the forest’s grace…"<br/>
"I give thanks to Asuta, Ai Fa, Mia Lei Wu, Sati Lei Wu, Vena Wu, Leina Wu, Lala Wu, Rimee Wu, and Shela Wu for tending to the hearth, so we may be given life tonight…"<br/>
Having 30-odd people praying together was quite a scene.<br/>
After finishing the pre-meal prayer, Donda Wu expressed his doubt, which was a rare sight:<br/>
"So how do we eat this? There’s plenty of food, but our arms aren’t that long."<br/>
"In this situation, shouldn’t we show the spirit of helping one another?"<br/>
I used a cheerful tone to disperse the gloomy mood of Zuro Tsun and the others.<br/>
"Leina Wu brought plenty of small plates, please use them for the food. If you want to try a dish that is further away, ask the person beside you to pass it to you."<br/>
The 35 people sat around the dishes. We already expected that getting the dishes would be more of a hassle.<br/>
"Anyway, let’s distribute the soup first; everyone, please help yourself."<br/>
Rau Lei who was seated to Ai Fa’s right said excitedly: "Even if you say that, we don’t know where to start!"<br/>
There were all sorts of dishes on the many large plates.<br/>
There were…<br/>
"Kiba burgers" covered in fruit wine sauce.<br/>
"Myam-roasted meat" made from aria, tino, and pula.<br/>
"Braised kiba" that was cooked together with a whole lump of aria.<br/>
"Meat Chachi" known for its piping hot chachi.<br/>
"Kiba sauté- Arrabbiata style" with a healthy helping of tarapa and some Chitto.<br/>
A large helping of salad to go with the "Kiba cutlet".<br/>
"Kiba roast ribs" made with special teriyaki sauce.<br/>
A huge pile of grilled poitan and various fried vegetables.<br/>
This was undoubtedly the most diverse feast in Forest’s Edge history.<br/>
It expended half of the kiba meat stored in the Wu clan village. As the Wu clan hunters had their offseason for the past half a month, the kiba preserved with pico leaves would only last for 20 or so days. But it was still impressive that they could supply the meat for the harvest feast, tonight’s dinner and for sale too.<br/>
And, of course, the meat wouldn’t run dry in a few days. If they hunted more kiba in the coming days, the Wu clan village wouldn’t need to starve. They also could use the money they earned to buy karon and kimyusu meat, but Forest’s Edge denizens didn’t even consider doing that.<br/>
For the hunters of Forest’s Edge, being at odds with a noble is just a trivial matter.<br/>
I thought as I stood up. As the head chef, I needed to distribute the soup.<br/>
I started with the new dish, the "Kiba meat karon milk stew".<br/>
This was the first dish I made in the Count Turan house.<br/>
I added kiba shoulder meat, aria, chachi, and neenon to boil and make stock. I then put in skimmed karon milk and added in poitan to make the stew thicker. It was seasoned with salt and pico leaves, and since I didn’t use nyuushi, this was a healthy dish with the refreshing fragrance of milk.<br/>
I quickly distribute it into plates, and Leina Wu who had stood up at the same time served them out to the guests.<br/>
At this moment, I heard a yell: "Uwahh…!"<br/>
Looking back, I saw Dan Lutim who was holding a rib rack with both hands leaned back stiffly.<br/>
"A-Asuta, these ribs…"<br/>
"Yes, I changed the ratio of Tau sauce and fruit wine. I also added a special ingredient called Chitto. Is it to your liking?"<br/>
"It’s delicious! Incredibly delicious!"<br/>
"That’s wonderful then."<br/>
By the way, only the Fa house and Wu clan bought Tau sauce, so Dan Lutim only ate Tau sauce during the Harvest Festival.<br/>
"Asuta, Asuta, this taste…"<br/>
"Well, you just need to use Tau sauce and Chitto to make this taste in the Lutim house. I will talk to the innkeeper and see if we can buy more Tau sauce."<br/>
"… Asuta, how did you know what I was thinking?"<br/>
I didn’t why either.<br/>
In any case, Dan Lutim dispelled the gloomy mood and made the banquet lively.<br/>
The women picked up the dishes near them and started chatting. Compared to the "Kiba burgers" and "Myam-roasted meat" they were familiar with, the new dishes were more popular.<br/>
"Uwah, this is amazingly soft!"<br/>
I heard Dali Sauti exclaim.<br/>
On his plate was a "Braised kiba".<br/>
"This is braised kiba chest meat. Do hunters like the tender sensation too?"<br/>
"No… I was just surprised, I have no problem with the taste. Speaking of which, this is astonishingly good."<br/>
The head of the Fou house who was having the same dish as him sighed in awe. The head of the Bemu house who took some "Myam-roasted meat" into his plate was staring wide-eyed.<br/>
"Is this… the dish we ate during the house head conference?"<br/>
"That’s right. I adjusted the taste slightly with a seasoning called Tau sauce."<br/>
More accurately speaking, what they ate back then was the "Myam-roasted meat" made by the Tsun clan women under the tutelage of me and the Wu clan ladies. It was quite far behind the "Myam-roasted meat" made by Shela Wu.<br/>
At this moment, someone shouted: "It hurts!"<br/>
"Asuta, my mouth hurts! Is this dish really fine?"<br/>
The one shouting was Rau Lei, and in his plate was "Kiba sauté- Arrabbiata style".<br/>
"Well, in this dish, I added a spice known as Chitto, which is loved by easterners. Compared to the one I’m selling, I already held back a lot on the spiciness. Is it still too spicy?"<br/>
"Yeah, it feels like biting into a pico leave by mistake."<br/>
Rau Lei muttered as he took another bite of the meat:<br/>
"It hurts, but tastes good…"<br/>
"That’s great. If it hurts too much, please use the soup to rinse away the spicy sensation."<br/>
Barcia seated beside Rau Lei was eating the same dish and drinking fruit wine heartily.<br/>
"How fashionable of you to use Chitto. You can only get them off caravans from the east. By the way… Asuta, your cooking skills are incredible."<br/>
"Thank you for the compliments. However, it isn’t just me, but everyone’s from the Wu clan who helped make this dish."<br/>
Both the main house and branch house members of the Wu clan enjoyed the dishes freely.<br/>
The women passed the plates around for the men to have a taste. Rimee Wu and Shin Wu ate the "Meat Chachi" and "Kiba roast ribs".<br/>
Grandma Jiba sat together with Mama Mia Lei and Grandma Ditto Min and ate the softer "Kiba burgers", "Braised kiba", and "Kiba cutlet".<br/>
Ludo Wu chatted with Darum Wu after having not seen each other for so long and was recommending the "Kiba cutlet" to him.<br/>
In Ludo Wu’s plate was the "Kiba meat and chachi croquette" that I made specially for him.<br/>
Lala Wu served the dishes to Shin Wu’s family and then sat with them to eat her own share of food. It was rare for this to happen during a normal meal, as everyone was free to change seats freely.<br/>
The serious-faced Donda Wu was discussing something with Jiza Wu, and Sati Lei Wu beside them was feeding Kota Wu "Kiba meat karon milk stew" with a spoon.<br/>
By the way, Kota Wu had stopped breastfeeding and moved on to baby food. Kota Wu was probably the first generation of Forest’s Edge denizen raised on the dishes I introduced. This made me a little nervous.<br/>
Anyway, aside from a minority, everyone was all smiles. It was as rowdy as a banquet.<br/>
At this moment, I locked eyes with Kaslan Lutim.<br/>
I nodded before averting my gaze.<br/>
Everyone had a share of the stew, but not everyone had touched their plates. And, of course, they were the seven people in the lower seats. Graff Zaza who was seated beside them only drank fruit wine.<br/>
I shifted some "Kiba roast ribs" and "Meat Chachi" into spare plates and walked towards them.<br/>
"Zuro Tsun. And… Diga and Doddo, it’s been a while."<br/>
Diga whose head was hung low slowly lifted his head.<br/>
I held my breath at the sight of his frail face.<br/>
The buffed Diga had thinned down to the size of the Fou house head. His eyes were sunken and his face pale, and gloom hung over his already plain face. His hair was messy and his beard wasn’t trimmed at all.<br/>
Doddo beside him wasn’t too different. He looked a little thinner, but his skeletal frame was as big as before. His stone lion-like face and stout figure didn’t change too much. But his intimidating aura was gone now.<br/>
And next was Zuro Tsun. This was the first time I saw him since the house head conference. He used to be one size fatter than Diga, but now had completely thinned down. His thin hair had balded even more, and he looked like a deflated toad.<br/>
His small beady eyes looked as murky as a dead fish, just like how Aura and the former members of the Tsun clan used to be.<br/>
This… is worse than I thought.<br/>
Zuro Tsun was facing a death sentence, and his execution was delayed because Pyschkurewuss demanded his extradition.<br/>
And when Zuro Tsun found out that Pyschkurewuss was stubbornly requesting us to hand him over, he cried and said: "Just kill me now."<br/>
Did Pyschkurewuss want to execute Zuro Tsun himself? Or was it just as Yamiel Lei deduced, and he wanted to restore the Tsun clan to the position of the tribal chief… Zuro Tsun had no way of knowing and just pleaded for a quick death. After he got turned down, he started acting like a living corpse.<br/>
The skin on his wrist had been torn from abrasion, and blood had seeped out. Not just Zuro Tsun, the same happened to Diga and Doddo. This was probably due to them being tied up by ropes at all times. They could walk but not run, and were restrained as criminals.<br/>
For all sorts of reasons, they just sat there without moving like mud dolls.<br/>
… All because I uncovered the Tsun clan’s crimes.<br/>
I didn’t regret doing so to Diga and Doddo. They committed so many insidious and barbaric acts that such a harsh punishment was warranted. I would never forgive them for abducting Ai Fa if they didn’t experience such a befitting fate.<br/>
However, Zuro Tsun was different. The thought that my revelations would result in someone dying gave me cramps in my stomach. Even if I told myself that it was inevitable, I couldn’t relief that pain.<br/>
Even so, I couldn’t turn my gaze away from the terrible fate awaiting this man. The tribal chiefs were the ones who gave him the death sentence, and the denizens of Forest’s Edge were just abiding by this decision. All the Forest’s Edge denizens had unanimously accepted Zuro Tsun’s death sentence. I tried expelling my troubled emotions and put down a plate in front of Zuro Tsun.<br/>
"… Zuro Tsun, can you try the dishes I made?"<br/>
Zuro Tsun didn’t respond.<br/>
Did he actually register my presence with his murky eyes?<br/>
On his right were Mida and Yamiel Lei, on his left were Aura and Zwei. But they didn’t touch the dishes at all. Even Mida didn’t eat a bite.<br/>
"Mida, won’t you have some? I’m confident of the dishes I cooked today."<br/>
"… Yes…"<br/>
Mida kept staring at Zuro Tsun with his beady eyes.<br/>
I thought Mida didn’t care too much about Zuro Tsun, Diga, and Doddo, unlike how he cherished Yamiel Lei, Zwei, and Aura… But Mida kept staring at his father and brothers.<br/>
"… You must have heard what Donda Wu said."<br/>
Graff Zaza who was sitting nearby finally said with a slurred voice. His intimidating voice made Diga and Doddo curl up into a ball.<br/>
"We will be facing the aristocrat Pyschkurewuss to answer for the crimes of your father and grandfather, Zattsu Tsun. Do you have the pride and conviction to atone for your crimes?"<br/>
"I… I…"<br/>
"Zattsu Tsun betrayed us all. He caused disaster to the people of Genos behind our backs. Asuta of the Fa house is working hard to right our relationship with Genos that had been twisted by Zattsu Tsun. That’s why Donda Wu thinks you should try the dishes Asuta is selling in the Post Station Town. I already said this much… Are you still trying to feign ignorance?"<br/>
"P-Please wait, Graff Zaza. Anyone will be afraid if you press them like that." I was thankful that Graff Zaza said that, but I still interjected. "Food won’t taste good if it is forced onto you. If you want to eat, then eat heartily."<br/>
"… What are you talking about?"<br/>
Graff Zaza took a large swig of fruit wine with fire in his eyes.<br/>
I took a deep breath and then turned towards Zuro Tsun:<br/>
"Allow me to say a few words. Zuro Tsun, Diga, and Doddo. We… used to be enemies. You caused trouble for the Fa house, and I uncovered the Tsun clan’s crimes, so let’s call it even."<br/>
"…"<br/>
"However, after getting adopted by Ai Fa of the Fa house, I want to be a denizen of Forest’s Edge too. I want to treat everyone in Forest’s Edge as my tribemate. And… Donda Wu also said you are a part of the Forest’s Edge too. Then I will treat you as fellow tribemate."<br/>
"…"<br/>
"Zattsu Tsun was too worried about the future of Forest’s Edge and went down the wrong path. Shouldn’t we work together to right this wrong?"<br/>
"… Can the current Zuro Tsun understand something so complicated?"<br/>
Yamiel Lei stood up suddenly and walked to my side.<br/>
She then kneeled before Zuro Tsun with the plate in her hands.<br/>
"Here, try some. You like delicious food, just like Mida, right, Zuro Tsun?"<br/>
Zuro Tsun looked at Yamiel Lei with vacant eyes.<br/>
"Morga Forest has plenty of tasty fruits and vegetables. However… Asuta’s used vegetables, harvested in farms, are more delicious."<br/>
Zuro Tsun took the plate with trembling hands. Yamiel Lei looked with satisfaction and glanced at Diga from the corner of her eyes.<br/>
"Diga, you like the kimyusu meat bought with copper plates, right? Even though you don’t have the guts to visit the Post Station Town."<br/>
"Ehh… I…"<br/>
"But this is kiba meat made by Asuta, which tastes even better than that. You didn’t have your fill of it during the house head conference, correct? You can eat to your heart’s content this time."<br/>
With that, Yamiel Lei pushed the dish I brought over to Diga.<br/>
"You are so thin because you hate the food the Zaza and Dom houses cooked for you, correct? Alright then, try some of this."<br/>
Diga took the plate timidly.<br/>
Yamiel Lei looked back at Doddo:<br/>
"You too, Doddo. You can’t drink your favorite fruit wine anymore, so indulge in this delicious dish."<br/>
"…"<br/>
"Can’t you hear me?"<br/>
For an instant, Yamiel Lei showed a venomous gaze.<br/>
And Doddo screamed hoarsely.<br/>
"Really now, all of you are useless. Have you lost your guts after losing the title of the tribal chief clan?"<br/>
Yamiel Lei stood up slowly.<br/>
And then turned to Mida:<br/>
"Mida, dig in. If you dally, the Wu clan and Lutim house will eat your share too."<br/>
"… Yes…"<br/>
"This is really tasty, don’t you want to try?"<br/>
"Yes… Mida wants…"<br/>
"Then eat up. I will get more for you."<br/>
Yamiel Lei turned and left.<br/>
I probably just happened to be in her field of vision, so she looked at me with her narrow eyes:<br/>
"Asuta, aren’t you going to eat? You don’t need to starve together with these people."<br/>
"Right. Yamiel Lei, what about you?"<br/>
"I drank some fruit wine."<br/>
Yamiel Lei suddenly averted her face and started filling up the plates.<br/>
She then squatted down flirtatiously and looked diagonally back at Aura.<br/>
"Aura, can you give me a hand? I can’t do it alone."<br/>
"Yes… Alright, Yamiel… No, Yamiel Lei…"<br/>
Aura stood up and started helping Yamiel Lei.<br/>
So I decided to help them too.<br/>
"Thank you, Yamiel Lei. I definitely couldn’t have done it on my own."<br/>
I thanked her quietly, but she just glared at me from the corner of her eye.<br/>
"You don’t need to thank me. The attitude of this bunch is unbelievable and makes me fume."<br/>
Just how was the Tsun clan like when they were still one family? The depraved clan head and heir, the violent second son who was a terrible drunk, and the wife and father-in-law with dead fish eyes.<br/>
And, the one viewed as the heir by the sinful former clan head, the eldest daughter who wished for the Tsun clan’s demise, how was she like at home?<br/>
At least, she didn’t serve dinner to her family with an angry face.<br/>
"Hey, Mida, are you eating properly?"<br/>
The kids ran over with large plates.<br/>
They were Rimee Wu and children from Shin Wu’s place.<br/>
"Look, it’s "Myam-roasted meat"! All of it would get gobbled up if we left it there, so I bought them over here!"<br/>
"Yes… Thank you…"<br/>
"Mida, give some to Zwei and the others."<br/>
When he heard what Yamiel Lei said, Mida’s face shook and he said: "Yes…"<br/>
A bright light shone in his pig-like beady eyes.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
5<br/>
"Here, eat up."<br/>
Yamiel Lei and I laid out the dishes before the men.<br/>
Zuro Tsun and Doddo drank soup weakly, while Diga slowly ate a "Meat Chachi".<br/>
Yamiel Lei observed them for a while, picked up a plate, and left. She headed to a buffed hunter wearing kiba hide over his head.<br/>
"Graff Zaza, have some too. The head of the Bemu house who opposed the Fa house’s business is eating excitedly too."<br/>
"… I won’t do what you say."<br/>
"Is that so. Then do what you will."<br/>
Yamiel Lei gracefully put the plate down before Graff Zaza and then went back to her seat.<br/>
"Asuta, hurry up and eat."<br/>
"Okay."<br/>
I couldn’t just return to my seat, so I sat down opposite Yamiel Lei. I heard a strange noise from beside me: "Ughh…"<br/>
Turning my head, I noticed it was Diga who had turned stiff after taking a bite from the "Kiba cutlet".<br/>
"This is the first time I saw this dish."<br/>
Yamiel Lei also tried the "Kiba cutlet" in her plate.<br/>
She then widened her narrow eyes in surprise.<br/>
"This… Asuta, this dish is incredible."<br/>
"This is "Kiba cutlet", which is very popular amongst the denizens of Forest’s Edge. But be careful, you will grow fat if you eat too much."<br/>
I didn’t want to talk about poison and whatnot during mealtime, so I said this in a roundabout manner. However, Yamiel Lei looked troubled as she put a hand on her soft belly.<br/>
"Ah, eating this much is fine, don’t be so worried."<br/>
I couldn’t help smiling because she was so funny, and she glared at me angrily: "You are so mean…"<br/>
"It’s delicious… Isn’t that right, Zwei?"<br/>
A quiet voice entered my ears.<br/>
Aura was eating the "Myam-roasted meat" Mida shared with her, as she looked at Zwei with gentle eyes. Zwei ate her food without a word.<br/>
When I realized it, Diga and Doddo were eating the food excitedly.<br/>
The soup plates were empty, and they were taking large bites of meat and vegetables.<br/>
A short while later… tears flowed out of Diga’s eyes.<br/>
He held back his sobs as he bit into his meat and drank tarapa soup. His face, covered in scruffy beard, was tearing up like a child.<br/>
Doddo finished his food without a word, and his table manners were similar to a dog that had starved for several days.<br/>
"… I think they still want more?"<br/>
Rimee Wu who was watching timidly said to no one in particular.<br/>
"Then I will get more. Mida, do you still want to eat?"<br/>
"Yes… Mida wants to eat everything…"<br/>
"Okay!"<br/>
Rimee Wu and the boys ran off to get more food.<br/>
The moment they left, two figures came over.<br/>
A small figure and someone holding her hand… They were Grandma Jiba and Ai Fa.<br/>
"… Pardon my intrusion…"<br/>
They two of them sat down beside me.<br/>
Grandma Jiba sat opposite Zuro Tsun.<br/>
"Zuro Tsun… This is the first time we met… I’m the grandmother of the Wu clan head Donda Wu, Jiba…"<br/>
Zuro Tsun looked at Grandma Jiba with hollow eyes.<br/>
He was still holding a half-finished plate of soup.<br/>
"Not just you, I have not seen that Zattsu Tsun either… The Tsun clan village is too far from the Wu clan village… If I remember correctly, the clan head two generations back… was Zattsu Tsun’s father…"<br/>
"…"<br/>
"That was seventy years ago… The Gazu tribal chief clan got wiped out by kiba… And the same fate befell their kin house Lima… The only clans that could lead our tribe were the Tsun and Wu clans… And we had settled in the north and south respectively to hunt kiba…"<br/>
"…"<br/>
"But I was the only main house member of the Wu clan, so the Tsun clan took on the position of tribal chief… No matter how many kin I might have, a woman can’t become tribal chief… However, the head of the Tsun clan was an outstanding hunter, so I didn’t need to worry and supported the decision to make him tribal chief…"<br/>
Her wise blue eyes stared at Zuro Tsun’s flabby face.<br/>
Zuro Tsun’s murky eyes seemed to be rippling like the waters of a lake disturbed by a pebble.<br/>
"The head of the Tsun clan… the new tribal chief was an outstanding man… Even the brusque Zaza and Dom house admired him… And Zattsu Tsun watched the back of his excellent father as he grew up…"<br/>
"…"<br/>
"However, Zattsu Tsun set down the wrong path… Zattsu Tsun was definitely trying to guide Forest’s Edge denizens down the right way… But at some point, he branched off into a wrong route… Or maybe, he chose the wrong way right from the start…"<br/>
"…"<br/>
"Eight decades ago, when we first arrived at the Morga Forest’s Edge, when the tribal chief clan was still the Gazu… The head of the Gazu clan might have agreed to the wrong terms with the Landlord of Genos… We didn’t interact with others in the southern dark jungle and revered the forest as our god, and we didn’t know how to get along with people outside the forest… That’s what I think was the problem…"<br/>
"…"<br/>
"But no one can blame the head of the Gazu clan… No matter who was the tribal chief, the same thing would have happened… But since we know we are on the wrong path, we have to get back to the right track… The tribal chief position changed from the Gazu to the Tsun, and now it is handled by the three new houses… I think we should work together to find the correct path…"<br/>
Grandma Jiba’s fingers that were like withered branches rested on the back of Zuro Tsun’s fat hand.<br/>
Zuro Tsun’s shoulder shook, but he didn’t make any other movement.<br/>
"So, Zuro Tsun… For the last time, help us as a member of Forest’s Edge… Don’t say something sad like wanting to die… If you have to pay for your crimes, your tribemates will wield their blades of judgment for you…"<br/>
"…"<br/>
"However… Since Zattsu Tsun already paid for the crime with his life, I don’t think it’s right to call for the blood of his son…"<br/>
After saying that, Grandma Jiba looked to Zuro Tsun’s right with her clear eyes.<br/>
Yamiel Lei was there.<br/>
"… You must be Yamiel Lei, correct…?"<br/>
"That’s right."<br/>
Yamiel Lei looked at Grandma Jiba fearlessly.<br/>
Grandma Jiba’s wrinkled face broke into a smile.<br/>
"You should stop trying to sacrifice yourself for your family… Your righteous pride is beautiful, but you don’t have to shoulder all that alone… You are a member of Forest’s Edge too…"<br/>
Yamiel Lei clicked her tongue and glared at me.<br/>
She was definitely referring to Yamiel Lei’s saying: "If Pyschkurewuss asks you to hand over the members of the Tsun clan, just give them the heir of Zattsu Tsun, me." I didn’t spread this around, so Grandma Jiba probably heard that from Rau Lei.<br/>
Anyway, I never imagined that Grandma Jiba would speak with Yamiel Lei.<br/>
"The Grand Elder of the Wu clan, Jiba Wu, I don’t understand what you are talking about, but I have my own thinking too."<br/>
"Fufu… And what might that be…?" Grandma Jiba smiled brightly, and Yamiel Lei looked at her provocatively. "Are you thinking that if Pyschkurewuss wants to reinstate the Tsun clan as tribal chief, the denizens of Forest’s Edge just need to hand Zuro Tsun and you over to them?"<br/>
Yamiel Lei flicked her dark brown hair that was done up in an intrinsic manner and said:<br/>
"What I mean is, I could become the new head of the Tsun clan, inherit the position of tribal chief, pretend to comply with Pyschkurewuss, and then uncover his crimes…"<br/>
"How foolish. A woman like you will never become tribal chief!"<br/>
Graff Zaza was listening the entire time and answered furiously.<br/>
Yamiel Lei looked at him seductively with the corner of her eye:<br/>
"It sounds stupid, but compared to you people who got into a rage saying ‘if there is no other choice, we will draw our blades to defy the nobles’, which do you think is more retarded? If we do it my way, at least no one will get hurt."<br/>
"… Are you really a denizen of Forest’s Edge? That Kaslan Lutim won’t be able to come up with such underhanded schemes. This is just like the nobles!"<br/>
"Isn’t it just right to use the same tricks against the ones who tricked us? It’s still better than turning to violence anyway."<br/>
"Yamiel Lei, this isn’t good… We can’t lie just for the sake of self-preservation… One misstep, and both you and Zuro Tsun might lose your lives…" Grandma Jiba shook her head with a smile still on her face: "You are not just the kin of Zattsu Tsun, you are a Lei house member now… You don’t need to shoulder any more burdens…"<br/>
"… I don’t think the stubborn tribal chiefs will agree with me anyways."<br/>
Yamiel Lei said irately and then looked at Zuro Tsun.<br/>
Could it be… When Zuro Tsun was yelling hysterically for death instead of being handed over to the nobles, Yamiel Lei already came up with her plan? That if she was present, Zuro Tsun could face the nobles bravely.<br/>
However, Graff Zaza and Donda Wu would never accept such a passive plan.<br/>
"Someone like you must be strong… Yamiel Lei, you have to help the tribal chiefs tomorrow…"<br/>
As she said that, Grandma Jiba pushed a plate filled with food to Zuro Tsun.<br/>
"Try Asuta’s cooking, Zuro Tsun… To you, who has lost your way, Asuta’s cooking will give you strength… Eat some of his food, and work hard tomorrow…"<br/>
There was an uneven light in his eyes as Zuro Tsun picked up the plate.<br/>
He picked up the spoon with trembling hands and scooped up a soft piece of "Braised kiba".<br/>
He then bit into it weakly… and a tear slid down his loose face.<br/>
"I…"<br/>
"Yes, what is it…?"<br/>
"I’m very afraid of my father Zattsu…"<br/>
Zuro Tsun mumbled as if he was daydreaming while chewing the meat.<br/>
Grandma Jiba listened quietly.<br/>
"However, other then the path laid down by father Zattsu, we didn’t have any other choice… I could only believe my father’s words… ‘One day, Zaza, Dom, and our other kin will walk down the same path as us and live proudly without bowing down to the nobles… Otherwise, all of us will get destroyed by the Wu clan…’"<br/>
"Sigh… The fate of dozens of your kin living in the Tsun clan village is affected because of your actions… I was a clan head once, so I understand your hardship…"<br/>
Grandma Jiba squinted her eyes, as if she was looking into the distance.<br/>
"But your burden is gone now… Your precious family, the kin who were your accomplices, and others will shoulder the responsibility for them in your place… So you can take on this new responsibility with everyone and seek out the path you feel is right…"<br/>
Zuro Tsun wept as he ate his food.<br/>
"… Finally, let me ask you, Zuro Tsun."<br/>
At this moment, Graff Zaza asked in a booming voice:<br/>
"Were you really unaware of the serious crimes committed by Zattsu Tsun and his associates in the Post Station Town? State the truth on your pride as a Forest’s Edge denizen…"<br/>
"I didn’t know… No, I was surprised by the large amount of copper plates my father Zattsu brought back out of nowhere… But I was too afraid to question their origin…"<br/>
"Zuro Tsun, your mistake stems from your weakness."<br/>
The furious Graff Zaza picked up a plate and bit into a "Kiba cutlet" with his white teeth.<br/>
"You fear your father Zattsu Tsun, fear the Wu clan, fear the Genos nobles… And fear your kin, the Zaza and Dom houses. This is a weakness ill befitting the denizens of Forest’s Edge. My biggest regret is supporting a weakling like you to be the tribal chief."<br/>
"…"<br/>
"… However, if you were half as competent as Zattsu Tsun or your eldest daughter, Zattsu Tsun would have confessed all his crimes to you and make you inherit it all. If that happened, more Genos people would have lost their lives."<br/>
Graff Zaza showed a feral gaze that could rival Donda Wu and said:<br/>
"The denizens of Forest’s Edge will never forgive your weakness… However, your weakness stopped the grudgeful will of Zattsu Tsun from being carried out, how ironic…"<br/>
Graff Zaza then washed down the "Kiba cutlet" with fruit wine:<br/>
"Anyway, your execution will be stayed until we resolve our issue with the nobles. Before your soul returns to the forest, live on as a member of the Forest’s Edge."<br/>
Zuro Tsun didn’t answer and only wept quietly.<br/>
Grandma Jiba watched him with a calm smile.<br/>
Diga and Doddo ate their food in silence.<br/>
Graff Zaza also finished his "Kiba cutlet".<br/>
Rimee Wu and her friends shouted: "Sorry for the wait" as they returned with plates filled with food. They came back a little late, so someone probably stopped them before Grandma Jiba finished her speech.<br/>
Thus ended this long conversation.<br/>
But someone directed the topic in an unexpected direction.<br/>
"Hmmp! So everyone will just comply with the new tribal chiefs’ judgment!?"<br/>
It was Zwei.<br/>
Zwei stood up and puffed out her thin chest, and glared at everyone present. She fixed her gaze on Yamiel Lei.<br/>
"Hey, Yamiel. You claim to be Zattsu Tsun’s heir, but I should be more suitable, right?"<br/>
"What are you talking about? You are our youngest sibling, so why would you say that?"<br/>
Zwei grunted again.<br/>
"But aren’t Zattsu Tsun and Grandpa Tay convicted as criminals? Both of their blood flows in my veins! So I’m most suited to be heir!"<br/>
Zattsu Tsun and Tay Tsun were both Zwei’s grandfather.<br/>
Tay Tsun’s daughter, Aura, looked at her daughter troubledly.<br/>
Grandma Jiba said gently: "Zwei… There is no reason in judging the child of a criminal to be a criminal…"<br/>
Fire of defiance burned in Zwei’s large sanpaku eyes, and she glared back at her:<br/>
"I don’t care about all that! That has nothing to do with me! If you want to fight the nobles, then do what you want!"<br/>
"Zwei!"<br/>
Zwei brushed past Aura who was seated beside her and disappeared into the darkness behind.<br/>
I got up quickly to give chase.<br/>
It was safe in the Wu clan village, but I couldn’t just leave her alone. I chased after Zwei by the light of the moon, and, fortunately, she was slower than me.<br/>
"Zwei, what’s wrong?"<br/>
I grabbed her body clad in a one-piece dress from behind.<br/>
Zwei suddenly screamed: "Don’t touch me!" and scratched the back of my palm with her nails.<br/>
She then glared at me with her angry eyes:<br/>
"Asuta of the Fa house, you must be really happy! The Tsun clan is destroyed just like you wanted! As expected of the number one brave of Forest’s Edge!"<br/>
"What do you mean by brave…"<br/>
A figure appeared beside the speechless me.<br/>
And, of course, it was Ai Fa. She left Grandma Jiba in the care of others and chased after me.<br/>
In the darkness where the light of the bonfire couldn’t reach, Zwei burst out in anger.<br/>
"Are you saying that people who can make more money are great? It must have been Zattsu Tsun and Zuro Tsun who believe that money is power that taught you that… I think that thinking is biased."<br/>
"Hmmp! Then why are you working to earn money, Asuta!? Aren’t you doing that to bring wealth to the impoverished Forest’s Edge!?"<br/>
"Yes, you are right…"<br/>
"Asuta is right, and the Tsun clan is wrong! All who support the Fa house and Wu clan will prosper, while the Tsun clan will get destroyed! Isn’t that right!? Asuta, you guys are the heroes, and the Tsun clan are all villains!"<br/>
"That’s because Zattsu Tsun and Zuro Tsun who were the tribal chiefs chose the wrong path. Do you disagree with that?"<br/>
Ai Fa asked quietly, and Zwei burst out with renewed fury:<br/>
"The villains aren’t just Zattsu Tsun and Papa Zuro! Grandpa Tay is one too! Grandpa Tay was executed as a criminal!"<br/>
"That’s because Tay Tsun drew his blade against us and the townsfolk…"<br/>
"Grandpa Tay just didn’t dare to defy Zattsu Tsun! No one in the Tsun clan dared to go against Zattsu Tsun, so why is Grandpa Tay the only one treated as a criminal!?"<br/>
"Like I said…"<br/>
"I know! Grandpa Tay and Zattsu Tsun killed many townsfolk! He even tried to kill Asuta, so he was cut down by the head of the Sudora house! Grandpa Tay paid for his crimes with his life!"<br/>
Zwei stomped as she screamed.<br/>
Tears welled out of her large eyes.<br/>
"I hate Asuta!"<br/>
"Zwei…"<br/>
Zwei reached her small fingers towards my chest as I stood stiffly in place.<br/>
"If I don’t hate you… Then Grandpa Tay will be too pitiful!"<br/>
With that, Zwei buried her face in my chest and wailed like a child.<br/>
No, Zwei was still twelve… Her petite body was that of an actual child.<br/>
I looked back speechlessly to my side, and Ai Fa was watching Zwei’s back with narrowed eyes.<br/>
I rested my hands on Zwei’s thin shoulders and knelt.<br/>
With a hand on his onion-like hair, I said: "Zwei… As Donda Wu said, no matter what crimes you committed, you are still a denizen of Forest’s Edge. Be it Zattsu Tsun or Tay Tsun, they were still Forest’s Edge denizen when they lived, and they died as members of the Forest’s Edge. Their frustrations and regrets will be corrected by Donda Wu and the others… That’s what I think."<br/>
"… I really hate… Asuta and you people…"<br/>
"Yes."<br/>
The moon in the night sky illuminated us in its faint blue light, and no one else came near us.<br/>
And so, on the eve of our confrontation with Pyschkurewuss, everyone spent the night with various thoughts on their mind.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
