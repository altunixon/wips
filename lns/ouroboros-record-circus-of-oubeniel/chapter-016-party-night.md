It’s kind of late. Sychev has just sent me this and I suppose I’ll edit this when I have the time. He said you can blame the tardiness on him and Japanese pranks of ghosts being put into taxis. Or something like that.<br/>
Anyway, the guy currently needs to laugh a lot. If you have a humorous thing to share. Movie, stories, comic/manga/anime, anything, send him a message in NU or something with that link.<br/>

Chapter XVI – Party Night<br/>
 <br/>
 <br/>
Construction of the Lord of Marlin’s new residence, which was started during the arrival of spring, advanced at an astonishing rate, and has now been completed.<br/>
Because the territory was a remote land, they couldn’t be elaborate with the mansion’s decorative side, thus the construction progressed in favour of the mansion’s functional aspects only.<br/>
As the viscount’s golems were put into work, and as the population was mobilised, the foundation works were finished at a considerably rapid pace.<br/>
The mansion was built as the base of the Viscount’s sitting administration, but unlike the deputy’s manor which laid in the centre of the town, it was located outside of the fortified town. As the mansion served to manage the administration of the entire viscountcy and not only the county town of Marlin, it was located near to the intersection of the highway which extended throughout the region. At the same time, the deputy’s manor, which was once the viscount’s temporary residence, was left as an office for vassals responsible for the town’s administration.<br/>
The newly built residence was more like a small castle, rather than a mansion.<br/>
The mansion is surrounded by a bailey, which itself is enclosed by a deep moat, and watchtowers are affixed to the main building. Since the mansion lies outside the fortification that protects the town, their presence is a given as a countermeasure against bandits or monsters.<br/>
However, for a building that claims to have disregarded appearance in pursuit of its utility, its hard, rugged appearance casts an intimidating impression to its surrounding, in a different sense than the deputy’s manor – which lords over the townscape.<br/>
If a stray traveler were to see the figure of this residence illuminated by the flashes during a thunderstorm, they’d go, ‘Good Lord, is this the Demon Lord’s castle, where evil spirits dwell?’ as they went to be frightened out of their wits. Really, what a pretentious piece of structure.<br/>
"What an eerie-looking dwelling. I’d say that it is just so like that little brother of his, though."<br/>
There was a building that couldn’t be called as a mansion nor a castle that sat on top of a small hill at a distance from the viscount’s residence. From there, a man muttered this ironically.<br/>
