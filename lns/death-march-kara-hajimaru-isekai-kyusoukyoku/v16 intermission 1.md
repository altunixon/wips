16-Intermission 1. Royal Capital Then<br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
"Arisa, which?"<br/>
"Shortcake is nice and all, but it just has to be mont blanc in fall!"<br/>
"Really?"<br/>
<br/>
Mia took the plate with shortcake while looking like she didn't really understand.<br/>
<br/>
"Delish."<br/>
<br/>
The cakes Lulu made really are superb.<br/>
Eating something sweet and tasty just blows away the fatigue from class.<br/>
<br/>
"Hey, Mia."<br/>
"Whaf (what)?"<br/>
<br/>
Mia whose mouth was filled with shortcake tilted her head at my question.<br/>
Kuh, cute. This kind of gestures suits Mia well.<br/>
<br/>
"What kind of incidents do you think Master encounter right about now?"<br/>
"Mwu--"<br/>
<br/>
Mia frowns.<br/>
<br/>
"--World crisis."<br/>
"Ah, you think so too?"<br/>
<br/>
Master's rate of encounter with incidents almost seems like he's been cursed by some god of pestilence.<br/>
He blew it all away with his cheat power every single time though so the person himself doesn't seem to be aware of his own misfortune.<br/>
I mean, it's at a level that'd normally make people cry out, "Such misfortuuuuuune."<br/>
<br/>
"What kind of person do you think brought about the world crisis?"<br/>
"....Cute girl."<br/>
<br/>
Mia replied unwillingly.<br/>
<br/>
Un, I think so too.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
◇<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
"For the creativity time, you are free to let out your passions to your heart's content."<br/>
<br/>
Teach said some difficult things.<br/>
<br/>
"Pochi is writing~?"<br/>
"Of course nanodesu. Today Pochi is writing 『A Stroll with Lyuryu』 nodesu."<br/>
<br/>
Pochi declared while taking the shupin pose.<br/>
<br/>
"Tama is going to draw a picture nodesu?"<br/>
"Of course~"<br/>
<br/>
Tama draws pictures.<br/>
Pictures are drawn by Tama.<br/>
<br/>
That's the natural order of things. Arisa said.<br/>
<br/>
"What's Tama drawing nodesu?"<br/>
"Difficult~"<br/>
<br/>
There's too many things Tama wants to draw.<br/>
<br/>
"Pochi thinks Tama should draw the food she wants to eat for dinner nodesu."<br/>
"Nice~"<br/>
<br/>
Pochi is a genius.<br/>
But she doesn't like vegetables. Cause they're a bit bitter.<br/>
<br/>
Tama's favorite food is meat.<br/>
She'd like to eat hamburg steak today.<br/>
A piping hot cheese-filled hamburg steak that gushes out flowing cheese when you cut it with a knife.<br/>
<br/>
She also likes one covered in flowing cheese and potatoes.<br/>
<br/>
Cheese and hamburg steak are justice.<br/>
<br/>
Tama puts her passions on the brush.<br/>

Now--.<br/>
<br/>
"--Tama-san, the class is over."<br/>
<br/>
Teach swayed Tama.<br/>
The class was over while she was spacing out.<br/>
<br/>
"Nyu?"<br/>
<br/>
The other kids are looking at Tama.<br/>
It feels a bit embarrassing.<br/>
<br/>
"Pochi, drool~?"<br/>
<br/>
Pochi who's peeking at the picture from the side is drooling badly.<br/>
Looking closer, even China has drools on the corner of her mouth.<br/>
<br/>
"Ta-Tama-san? Would you be willing to sell this picture?"<br/>
"Not for sale~?"<br/>
<br/>
China asked.<br/>
This picture is for Master.<br/>
Tama's sure Master would praise Tama like, 'Well done, Tama.'<br/>
<br/>
Perhaps, Master might even let Tama sleep on his lap while patting her head.<br/>
<br/>
"Nihehe~"<br/>
<br/>
Tama smiled unintentionally.<br/>
Gotta ask brownies to make a frame when Tama got back.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
◇<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
"--Delicious."<br/>
<br/>
I heard about this store's fame in the capital, but it was even better than the rumors.<br/>
It's just a simple tofu nabe, yet it has the umami of the dashi even without condiments and broth added.<br/>
<br/>
"Getting a passing mark from Lulu, that's amazing desuwa."<br/>
"But Karina-sama, this nabe really is delicious, you know?"<br/>
<br/>
Karina-sama and Zena-san who came to this shop with me have only been talking while watching me, not touching tofu with their chopsticks.<br/>
<br/>
"You two, this nabe is really good, you should have yours too."<br/>
"Yes, you're right, it'll be a waste if the taste spoils because they get overcooked."<br/>
"That's true desuwane. It's not as good as Satou's dishes, but it's still really good desuwa."<br/>
<br/>
Karina-sama, Master's dishes are a class on its own.<br/>
I mean, Master is the [Miracle Chef] after all.<br/>
<br/>
"Fhy fhe fway (by the way), Zena."<br/>
"Yes, what is it?"<br/>
<br/>
『Karina-dono, it's bad manners to speak during meals.』<br/>
"Im fowwy"<br/>
<br/>
Raka-san scolded Karina-sama who spoke with her mouth full.<br/>
Karina-sama continues after swallowing the tofu.<br/>
<br/>
"What is her highness Sistina doing?"<br/>
"It seems like she's currently running about to prepare the ceremony for we--no, for when Satou-san and the others come back."<br/>
"Ceremony?"<br/>
"U-umm, I'm not really sure either..."<br/>
<br/>
I wonder if it's the thing Arisa and her highness talked about?<br/>
<br/>
"I don't really get it myself, but Arisa said that it was something like a celebration."<br/>
"Celebration?"<br/>
<br/>
I supplemented with what I thought since Karina-sama looked puzzled.<br/>
<br/>
"Is that true?"<br/>
"Y-yes. She's making dresses for everyone for that celebration."<br/>
<br/>
--Dress.<br/>
It's something that doesn't really have anything to do with me.<br/>
<br/>
"For Pochi and the girls too?"<br/>
"Yes, Sistina-sama said that everyone in the Solitary Island Palace will get a dress."<br/>
<br/>
...Which means, me too?<br/>
<br/>
I quietly touched my stomach and felt sweat running down my spine.<br/>
<br/>
"Oh my? Lulu, are you done already?"<br/>
"Yes, I've grasped the taste--"<br/>
<br/>
--And it's dangerous for my waistline.<br/>
<br/>
I have to slim down my waistline a bit more if I were to stand next to Liza-san and Nana-san.<br/>
I've got to the labyrinth city through the solitary island palace and get some exercise.<br/>
<br/>
In order to compensate for my face handicap, I've got to build a beautiful body line!!<br/>
It's essential for the upcoming maiden fight.<br/>
