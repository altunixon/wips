Chapter 298: Journal of the Hero<br/>
We began browsing through the Houou reports inside of the castle.<br/>
There a couple of books documenting the damage caused by it.<br/>
Apparently, the number of casualties was nothing to laugh at.<br/>
As a last ditch resort, the Heroes were summoned, and Houou was sealed.<br/>
"Ren, Motoyasu, Itsuki, by your knowledge, where was Houou sealed?" (Naofumi)<br/>
"That mountain." (Itsuki)<br/>
Itsuki looks out of the window, and indicates a mountain… It looks like a standard oriental mountain.<br/>
He points his finger at it.<br/>
"Yep, there." (Ren)<br/>
"That’s right, Father-in-Law, there." (Motoyasu)<br/>
"Fumu… in your games, how exactly was the seal broken?" (Naofumi)<br/>
"It was during a quest, right? It revived from the stone structure acting as its seal."<br/>
"I see." (Naofumi)<br/>
In the Spirit turtle’s case, the vibrations caused by the monster destroyed much of the murals depicting it.<br/>
But now, we can go through the information at our own leisure. How relaxing.<br/>
Hmm?<br/>
It’s a journal left behind by one of the Heroes that sealed it.<br/>
From summoning to challenging Houou, it has multiple volumes depicting scenes from the start of his life in this world, to his death… apparently.<br/>
It’s like that.<br/>
Using the wisdom of your ancestors.<br/>
Imitating some hero of old to beat or seal a monster.<br/>
I mean, school teaches us to act like great people long dead, right?<br/>
The journal detailed him being summoned, and chosen as the Seven Star Hero of the Gauntlet. It detailed his daily life of fighting.<br/>
I have no idea what his past world was like.<br/>
This report says nothing of VRMMOs or Espers. Is he from a world like mine or Motoyasu’s?<br/>
This kinda reads like a Web Novel, though it’s based on his real experience.<br/>
Something about beating up a guy who pissed him off. A majority of it was just about the guy bragging.<br/>
Quit talking about your Harem. That’s just disgusting.<br/>
I really don’t care about the touching scenes with your heroines.<br/>
His wife number 1 seems to be the princess present at his summoning, but mentioning princesses around us is like stepping on a landmine. The girl’s real name is included.<br/>
Including me, are all otherworlders like this?<br/>
Anyways, I tried to skim through it, but worried about missing crucial info, so I started reading it carefully.<br/>
When will I find something useful?<br/>
And wait, leaving something like this for the future generation, what was this guy thinking…?<br/>
Was it simply a diary?<br/>
I mean, it’s written in Japanese, so this world’s people can’t read it. That possibility exists.<br/>
That means that it might be highly dramatized.<br/>
At least, I don’t think the individual planned for anyone else to read it.<br/>
Otherwise, it would just be embarrassing.<br/>
Ren has a doubtful expression.<br/>
Motoyasu is… having Midori read it, and is playing with his three’s feathers.<br/>
Wait, Midori can read Japanese?<br/>
Itsuki is indifferently reading through it. But if he finds anything, I think he’ll speak up.<br/>
Just tell us about Houou already.<br/>
And… I read through each and every volume of it.<br/>
The only books missing are the ones pertaining to Houou, and the ones pertaining to the wave.<br/>
If only he depicted his strengthening methods, of how to class up, or something like that.<br/>
"Oy, the most important parts are missing." (Naofumi)<br/>
"This is all the information we have on hand." (Scholar)<br/>
Again.<br/>
Oy… why do they only have this set of thin books, with the necessary info omitted?<br/>
Did someone intentionally get rid of it?<br/>
I really want to complain to someone, but it is as it is. There was no useful information.<br/>
"… In the past, a war raged on this land. At that time, much of our information went up in flames."<br/>
"The flame really was accurate in the information it swallowed." (Naofumi)<br/>
"I-I’m sorry…"<br/>
The scholar apologizes as he reorganizes the reports, and looks over them.<br/>
Uwah… this is useless.<br/>
But it’s not like complaining will do anything.<br/>
"This is the last one. A single manuscript remained."<br/>
I was handed a bundle of paper.<br/>
This is more of a stack of scraps than a book. What’s more, it’s full of holes.<br/>
Ah, it has a minimal description of Houou.<br/>
Houou’s goal is… to win… is prevented.<br/>
You cannot seal it during the last set of waves.<br/>
And to defeat it, you need to… both… or else…<br/>
Here is its attack pattern…<br/>
As expected, the writing was unable to withstand the ages. Much of it is impossible to decipher.<br/>
I mean, the above was the only thing I could figure out after consulting the rest of the Heroes.<br/>
For it to become illegible just before going into attack patterns, are they trying to insult me?<br/>
Who was it? Who was so negligent in taking care of this precious manuscript?<br/>
"Next is a mural left by the past heroes. Could you please look over that as well?" (Scholar)<br/>
"Sure."<br/>
Expecting murals like that in the Spirit Turtle’s city, we stepped into a temple that seemed to be a tourist attraction.<br/>
"The armies are lined up strangely."<br/>
At the temple’s front gate, a structure slightly separated from the main body, I noticed a queue forming.<br/>
Some merchants are walking around and peddling to the line… When Houou is this close… Their commercial spirit is admirable.<br/>
"That is also an area we would like to have the Heroes check out later."<br/>
"Hmmm."<br/>
So I won’t have to ask about it now.<br/>
What we need right now is information on our foe.<br/>
There’s a high probability that we’re the only ones who can understand what’s written on the mural.<br/>
It may just look like a strange pattern to those of this world, but to us, they should become letters.<br/>
Like with the Spirit Turtle.<br/>
And like that, we stepped into the building.<br/>
It appears that this truly was a tourist spot dedicated to the heroes. We continue walking through the stone structure.<br/>
The atmosphere feels heavy.<br/>
As we walk, our steps echo into the darkness.<br/>
A Buddhist priest-like person came to greet us… Even so, I see a few catholic priest-like people as well. What’s going on with this world’s religion?<br/>
Flickering candles light the dark temple.<br/>
The indie of it was decorated by several statues mimicking the beast.<br/>
The gloomy atmosphere only seemed to make me more nervous.<br/>
"And? Where’s the mural the heroes supposedly left?" (Naofumi)<br/>
On the wall were several works with old writing, and murals of what looked to be from the Mayan civilization. I can’t tell which one it’s supposed to be.<br/>
I feel like I’m being given a tour of a strange attraction rather than a monument.<br/>
"It’s this one."<br/>
We were led to the deepest part of the temple, where we found a large… fresco.<br/>
But… It’s dark. I can’t see the whole picture.<br/>
"It’s dark. 「Faust Glow Fire」."<br/>
The Queen lights the dark room.<br/>
What was before us truly was a depiction of Houou.<br/>
I don’t know if it was done by Heroes, but what’s shown are two large birds, surrounded by a sea of fire.<br/>
Just from its looks, I guess it attacks by using its wings, dropping fire, and using its claws.<br/>
The birds themselves seem to be like peafowls, with scales on their bodies.<br/>
Its tail feathers fanned out to form a… fish-like tail?<br/>
It wasn’t red, but a collage of various colors. It was quite different from what I imagined.<br/>
One stayed in the center displaying its vibrant colors, while the other circled around it with opposing colors.<br/>
But perhaps due to its age, the damage to the mural is severe.<br/>
It seems that it’s been preserved well, though.<br/>
Its method of attacks were made apparent by the mural.<br/>
The first bird would fly to a high altitude, and bombard the ground below with magic and fire. The second would fly low, and attack with claws, and breaths of flame. They coordinated attacks like that.<br/>
Of course, this could just be a work of fiction, or an over dramatization. But that’s what was shown.<br/>
"It sure has some troublesome attacks."<br/>
It clothes everything around it in flames, and turns the scorched corpses into zombies…<br/>
The Spirit Turtle had a similar ability.<br/>
Also, the feathers that are produced from its wings can give birth to familiars.<br/>
Just how versatile is this monster?<br/>
But based on its depiction, and comparing it to the buildings in the background, I don’t think it’s as big as the Spirit Turtle.<br/>
Though it probably is of considerable size.<br/>
One was slightly bigger that parent Gaelion pre-mortem.<br/>
And we have to fight two.<br/>
"Ren, was you Houou similar?" (Naofumi)<br/>
"Yeah, mostly… But it didn’t have a breath attack." (Ren)<br/>
"There are a few attacks I don’t know of as well. Mine never used its wings to stir up wind. But this one seems to create whirlwinds, and summon tornadoes." (Itsuki)<br/>
"Father-in-Law, the ability I don’t know of is its ability to summon familiars." (Motoyasu)<br/>
So the games were different from reality.<br/>
Even so, I think this every time, but why are all the depictions and the other hero’s information full of holes?<br/>
They have half-assed info, but with that, it seems anyone would make the mistake.<br/>
If I had information like them, perhaps I would have mistakenly challenged the Spirit Turtle as well.<br/>
…? Something’s bugging me, but… I can’t tell what it is.<br/>
It’s like something’s stuck in my throat.<br/>
But it feels like the sort of thing I won’t figure out if I keep thinking about it.<br/>
