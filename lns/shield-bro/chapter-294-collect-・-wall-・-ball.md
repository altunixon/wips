Chapter 294: Collect ・ Wall ・ Ball<br/>
We continued leveling for the Wave. I got the Old Man to make Raphtalia a new sword and placed an order for Firo’s claws with Imya’s Uncle. With that out of the way, we zealously proceed to level grind.<br/>
Because of this, my level has already climbed to 105.<br/>
Raphtalia’s and Firo’s were frozen at 100, so they’re prepared enough.<br/>
The others in the village are also reaching quite high levels.<br/>
Especially the Heroes. They’re all somewhere around level 115. Their strength is also considerable.<br/>
It may have something to do with that peculiar weapon, but Rishia was able to break the level cap and advance to level 105.<br/>
Then… the problem lies with Atlas and Fohl.<br/>
Let me reaffirm the situation with the siblings.<br/>
Every day, Atlas tries to sleep by my side. To get through the strict defenses on my house, she attacks from the front and ends up fighting every night.<br/>
And every time, Raphtalia, Fohl, the Raph Race, or the Filo Rials try to halt her advance. But please remember something.<br/>
Atlas is a genius.<br/>
By experiencing something once, she can adapt 10 or 20 times faster than a normal person.<br/>
"Just a little bit more!" (Atlas)<br/>
"How unfortunate for you."<br/>
"I was told that interrupting Naofumi-san’s sleep was a bad thing, so…"<br/>
I deployed a powerful force in front of the buildings. The Heroes, Itsuki, and Ren stand to confront her. They’ve grown to have ample ability to do so.<br/>
I discussed it with Ren a couple of days ago…<br/>
"Honestly, among the children in the village, the one growing the most is that Atlas girl." (Ren)<br/>
"Yes." (Itsuki)<br/>
"I see." (Naofumi)<br/>
Since the Houou battle was approaching, I increased the amount of time I spent training with him.<br/>
Of course, Raphtalia, Firo, Fohl, and Atlas also spar. And Atlas’s movements have become unbelievably sharp.<br/>
She even studied my style of defense, and even helps me study the application of Chi.<br/>
That Hengen Musou Granny said that Atlas’s defensive techniques were lacking, so I worked together with the girl to develop new techniques from the ground up.<br/>
The name is just temporary, but we made the skills "Collect", "Wall", and "Ball".<br/>
First is "Collect".<br/>
This is for magic-based attacks. Using Chi, you can move and redirect a magic attack aimed at you.<br/>
It’s convenient when facing large scale magic head on.<br/>
Its radius of effect is three meters.<br/>
Of course, if you infuse more chi into it, you can increase that.<br/>
Next is "Wall".<br/>
This technique manifests an invisible wall for a few seconds to obstruct enemies.<br/>
It mostly works like my Air Strike Shield.<br/>
It can stop physical and magical attacks to some extent.<br/>
It’s much more all-purpose than the skill. Its deployable area is also really large.<br/>
Its weak points are its low defense, and its short effective time.<br/>
Last is "Ball". This one is a counter skill.<br/>
Using it, you can gather and condense a magic attack and send it right back at the caster. Of course, there are plenty of magics it cannot send back, so it isn’t that effective.<br/>
It works on a different principle than hitting attacks back with my shield.<br/>
I made it so that Atlas was able to use these skills.<br/>
They’re skills based on my natural ability of defense, and Atlas was just mimicking that, though.<br/>
"It’s hard to read her movements, and she’s fast. What’s more, whenever I think I’m going to hit, she immediately diverts my attacks. I can’t get any damage through to her." (Ren) "And on top of that, her attacks naturally ignore defense, so it’s hard to develop countermeasures." (Itsuki)<br/>
"But do you think you will be able to do anything about it?" (Naofumi)<br/>
"Probably. But, if I fought her one on one, I would have to go all out, or it would be difficult." (Ren)<br/>
"It would be hard to stop her without giving her serious injury." (Itsuki)<br/>
For a fully strengthened Hero to have to go all out… Just how fast is she growing?<br/>
But since the Heroes try to avoid killing any villagers, they have to hold back. I guess it would be a hard fight.<br/>
"Fohl-kun can stop her, so I think we’ll manage one way or another, but as expected of the strongest Demi-Human race, the Hakukos." (Itsuki)<br/>
Itsuki speaks with an uninterested tone.<br/>
By hearing him, I don’t get the impression that they’re strong at all.<br/>
Even so, Fohl is quite something to be able to stop her as well.<br/>
"Yeah, keeping up with her is the best I can do. She’s way too agile." (Ren)<br/>
By the way, Fohl is at 110, and Atlas at 103.<br/>
Just how strong is my village getting?<br/>
Atlas always takes on a large number of opponents, so she gets a lot of battle experience unrelated to her level.<br/>
During the day, she trains with other strong geniuses like Firo and Sadina. She’s constantly improving herself.<br/>
"Is she seriously that strong?" (Naofumi)<br/>
When I train with her, I can take her blows just fine.<br/>
Perhaps she holds back against me. I can’t refute the possibility.<br/>
Should I ask her to come at me seriously next time?<br/>
If she manages to beat the crap out of me, I have no idea what I’ll do.<br/>
"Since Naofumi can only be on the defense, it’s hard to find opportunities to attack, I bet. We have to mix in offense as well." (Ren)<br/>
"This is the first time I’m hearing of it. Just taking attacks is hard in itself, you know. I mean, aren’t you better off than someone who has virtually no offensive power?" (Naofumi)<br/>
"Well, I can’t argue with that." (Ren)<br/>
Just keeping up defenses is easy… There may be some people who think that, but that’s definitely not the case.<br/>
You have to catch and shift the impact of opponents’ blows to stop them, and parry them as well. You can’t just hold up a shield.<br/>
What’s more, my self-made defense style also allows me to break opponents’ weapons, thus aiding my party.<br/>
This does not work on Legendary Weapons, of course.<br/>
I can do Shirahatori, and grab weapons and arrows out of midair. (TL: Shirahadori is that thing where you clap your hands on a sword swinging downwards)<br/>
I can interfere with magic as well, and support magic is my duty.<br/>
And wait, that’s kinda all I can do. I mean, there’s no helping it. I just don’t have offensive capability.<br/>
Back to Atlas.<br/>
When sparing with me, she uses her speed to feign and break through my defense.<br/>
I’m usually able to deal with it, but I don’t think my speed is that high. Is she really going easy on me?<br/>
"But you definitely are good at stopping attacks. Perhaps you learned to keep up with Atlas’s speed." (Ren)<br/>
"It’s a matter of practice." (Naofumi)<br/>
"Well… That’s true. Their race really does seem like it was born for battle. (Ren)<br/>
"Is that so? When she trains with Firo and the Raphs, she doesn’t look like anything special." (Naofumi)<br/>
Looking at just speed, Firo is peerless.<br/>
Her attacks are extremely quick and heavy.<br/>
She can also accelerate herself to greater levels with Magic, so she’s more troublesome of an opponent than Atlas.<br/>
The Raphs aren’t as fast as Filo Rials, but they can use illusionary magic like Raphtalia. If you lose sight of reality, then they can easily sneak through your defense.<br/>
And also, they have their numbers…<br/>
"Firo-chan’s really big, so it’s easier to hit her. But Atlas’s small build and dexterity make it really hard to land any blows on her." (Ren)<br/>
"Yes." (Itsuki)<br/>
Her size, is it?<br/>
Even though her level’s grown to 103, she hasn’t grown at all.<br/>
I don’t know the reason, but perhaps it has something to do with her past illness.<br/>
Even so, enemy size…<br/>
Now that you mention it, Firo is big.<br/>
When trying to dodge, her size is a disadvantage.<br/>
And Atlas’s size is troublesome in another way.<br/>
The threats are of different categories.<br/>
"Fuee… Atlas-chan is getting stronger by the day. It’s really troubling." (Rishia)<br/>
"I see… How’s Raphtalia doing, then?" (Naofumi)<br/>
"Yes, she’s gradually getting stronger too. Her movements are getting sharper and more intense." (Itsuki)<br/>
Fumu.<br/>
"If we have members of that level of strength, won’t the Houou battle be easy?" (Ren)<br/>
"No, it seems Atlas won’t be participating in the Houou campaign." (Naofumi)<br/>
"Why?" (Ren)<br/>
Ren asks with a perplexed expression.<br/>
"I made a promise to Fohl that I wouldn’t let her participate against Houou. That’s why I’m taking up applicants for that battle, but Atlas won’t be included." (Naofumi)<br/>
I think it’s at the same moment I said those words.<br/>
Behind me, I hear the sound of something hitting the ground.<br/>
When I turn around, I see a sack on the floor and Atlas staring in our direction.<br/>
Her timing is bad.<br/>
And wait, isn’t my probability of happening upon these cliché situations unreasonably high?<br/>
"What’s wrong, Atlas?" (Naofumi)<br/>
"Naofumi-sama… You’re not going to deploy me into battle?" (Atlas)<br/>
"Yep, most likely. I made a promise with your brother." (Naofumi)<br/>
"Naofumi-sama! I declared that I would be your shield, did I not? Then I need to be by your side in battle!" (Atlas)<br/>
"Even if you say that, I already made a promise. I decided I would keep such promises even if it killed me. As long as I properly agreed to the deal, at least." (Naofumi)<br/>
"Onii-sama…" (Atlas)<br/>
Atlas unsteadily walks off. She seems anxious as she increases her pace.<br/>
"I’m worried about Fohl-kun, so I’m going to go check on him."<br/>
"Me too." (Ren)<br/>
"I as well." (Itsuki)<br/>
"Fuee… I’m also worried…" (Rishia)<br/>
Hmmmmmmm… The trust placed in Atlas seems to be low.<br/>
For the first thing everyone assumes to be her assaulting Fohl, just how hasty are these people?<br/>
No matter how I look at it, it didn’t seem that way.<br/>
"Fohl’s off getting materials to make an accessory for Atlas, isn’t he?" (Naofumi)<br/>
Everyone has break time on rotation, and Fohl uses his to go fetch materials.<br/>
I won’t speak up over what he does on his vacations.<br/>
He seems to have placed an order from Imya’s Uncle, so he left Atlas in Raphtalia’s hands and left.<br/>
He’ll probably be back by tomorrow, so he’s safe for today.<br/>
"Now that you mention it, that’s right."<br/>
"Yeah."<br/>
"But tomorrow, I feel that something will happen."<br/>
It’s a road we’ll have to cross eventually.<br/>
Now then, will Fohl be able to stop Atlas?<br/>
I have to start preparing for the campaign.<br/>
So far, preparations have been smooth.<br/>
The Heroes have sufficiently recovered from their curses.<br/>
Besides his personality problems, Itsuki’s curse isn’t a hindrance anymore. His level even recovered.<br/>
From my visits to the Onsen every day, I’ve fully recovered from my wrath. Even the curses from when I went strange have disappeared.<br/>
The only remaining effects are that my experience gets sucked away at regular intervals, and whenever I compound, the product is dropped a few levels in quality.<br/>
The levels of those in the village that volunteered to fight in the wave are quite high as well, and the monsters are quite motivated.<br/>
I feel like praising myself for raising them ‘til now.<br/>
By the way, the voice of the slaves, besides Raphtalia, is Kiel.<br/>
She doesn’t have any delegated position, but she’s quite powerful in battle.<br/>
Though, she’s constantly bound to her Crepe Tree.<br/>
When I asked her if she would participate in the wave, she was overflowing with eagerness.<br/>
