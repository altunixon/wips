Arifureta After II   Cannot Stay as Onlooker<br/>
<br/>
The near future type aircraft made in another world was racing through the sky at a speed that left the territory of sound with a lurch.<br/>
It detoured a large cloud mountain with an amazing turn in an attempt to shake something off. It then accelerated in one go from its slight reduction in speed. The nozzle at the plane’s rear was ejecting sparkling silver particles――the ejected amount increasing explosively.<br/>
The sky battlecraft intruded into the world of the speed of sound once more with an impact sound. The surrounding clouds were blown away due to the shockwave. Its acceleration knew no end and had easily surpassed Mach 2 already.<br/>
"NUOOOOOH-. THAT’S REALLY FAST-. AS EXPECTED FROM A FIGHTER PLANE! IT’S GETTING AWAYYYYY-"<br/>
A beat later, a black dragon with a desperate look appeared through the cloud mountain. A whirling black wind was enveloping Tio. Seen from the side, it looked like there was a jet black typhoon flying horizontally.<br/>
It was Tio’s flying skill that realized flying at super speed by reducing the air resistance to the extreme, and furthermore, she caused a spiral-shaped wind around herself to convert it into propulsive power. Even if one looked at the long history of the dragon race, there didn’t exist anyone that entered the realm of the speed of sound.<br/>
Therefore, something like storming into an unknown territory of speed was truly something out of the realm of common sense, and what’s more, it didn’t just stop there, she was actually flying while maintaining a speed that was twice the speed of sound. A miraculous feat that couldn’t be possibly realized without the age of god magic called "Sublimation magic" and the assistance of an artifact. Of course, there was also the delicate yet powerful skill that should be referred to as Tio’s own special talent.<br/>
Tio was unmistakably the history’s fastest living thing on Tortus. However, it was a fact that against this aircraft that was continuously accelerating she was gradually getting left behind. She somehow managed to stay hot on its tail despite the aircraft sometimes taking evasive maneuvers against the threat of Hajime’s sniping but……<br/>
"Hmm~, looks like it will reach the limit soon even with the threatening. It seems he is starting to realize that we have no intention of hitting him."<br/>
"Nuu. I know that I couldst not win against a fighter plane in a match of pure speed, but……when it comes down to it, it’s vexing to be left behind like this."<br/>
"No, by the time there is a biological creature that can freely fly in the sky at speed twice the speed of sound, complete with heavy armor and high firepower, that’s already a nightmare. You too have deviated far from the scope of a living thing you know?"<br/>
"I’m happy to be praised, but it’s only this that I couldst not accept even with logic."<br/>
Tio was looking at the far away sky battlecraft that was already nothing but a speck in the sky while moaning「Muu」in dissatisfaction.<br/>
Seeing Tio as such, for a beat, Hajime tilted his head as though he was thinking of something, and right after that he grinned――and took out something.<br/>
It looked black, thin, long, and elastic――<br/>
"Here we go, Tio. Let’s show off our combination move."<br/>
"Mu? What in the world――-, tha, that’s!?"<br/>
Tio glanced back after hearing Hajime’s words and opened her eyes wide in astonishment. Her voice was raised half in shock and half in joy.<br/>
That thing which captured her gaze. That thing which was going to be swung right now.<br/>
――Black Whip ver 2.1   "This is not a weapon. It’s for personal use desu."<br/>
It could be easily guessed for what kind of personal use it was used for.<br/>
"GO-, TIO! UNTIL THE OTHER SIDE OF THE SKY!"<br/>
The black whip was swung down. *hyun-* It split the air and dexterously flew right behind while making a really crisp sound *bechin-*.<br/>
"AA―――!! HOW COULDDDDDD-. Thi, this sensation that hath been a while-"<br/>
"What’s the matter Tio! Your strength shouldn’t be just this much!"<br/>
Once more, *bechikon-!* The greatly twirling whip’s tip was *donpisha-* striking Tio’s butt.<br/>
"IT CAME IT CAME IT CAME-! MINE POWER IS OVERFLOWING OUT! MORE! HIT MY BUTT MOREEE! WITH THAT, I FEEL LIKE I COULDST GO FURTHER!"<br/>
"You said it! You matchless pervert dragon! I’ll give you more!"<br/>
"BRING IT O―――N-!!"<br/>
Tio’s eyes were getting moist. Her mouth was leaking out heated breaths ‘haa haa’. Her body was shivering in joy, and the jet black tornado enveloping her was fiercely increasing its acceleration! By using her special skill "Pain Conversion", the reward that was granted to her by her master was giving her strength! Her speed was endlessly increasing!<br/>
The sky battlecraft that had turned into a speck was getting larger and was now comparable to the size of a thumb!<br/>
"PLEASE HIT ME! MINE BUTT! PLEASE TORMENT IT MORE!"<br/>
*hyun hyun-hyuun-* Accompanying the sound of slicing wind was the sound of a whip cracking *bishi-, bashi-, bechikon-* as though in response to that entreaty. By using the personal use artifact that was bypassing the black scales and granting direct and superb pain only to the sensitive skin, the hopeless dragon-san was reaching her perfect form!<br/>
The sky battlecraft in front of them was reeling for an instant.<br/>
Just when he thought that he had barely escaped with his life from the incomprehensible monster that destroyed sky battlecraft using a flesh and blood body, a majestic black dragon that he had never seen before was chasing after him clad in a jet black typhoon. In addition to that, the dragon was moving at the speed of sound while also being equipped with something like a laser cannon.<br/>
He lost count of how many times he had made a mistake with his piloting and reduced his speed from shock……<br/>
On top of all that, came a perverted roar that was mixed with excitement"HIT MINE BUTTTTT-"that reached his ear as though that solemn voice was coming from the sky.<br/>
The pilot was in chaos! Then he became teary-eyed! He couldn’t understand what reality was anymore!<br/>
「Glowser 4-. I believe in you! Get me out of this nightmare!」<br/>
The pilot called out to his beloved plane――Glowser 4――in a pleading voice. The mindless plane was naturally keeping silent, but due to the hard pressing of the slot pedal, it was displaying its ability up to the very limit of its performance.<br/>
Based on the specifications it was a super-fast sky battlecraft that could reach the maximum speed of Mach 4.4 in a purely straight line. It left behind an explosive sound that was similar to the air rupturing and dashed through the sky like the streak of a meteor.<br/>
Behind it, the hopeless dragon-san managed to stay on its tail! The owner-san riding on her back was swinging around a "personal not weapon" without pause in high spirits! Howls of joy were resounding through the vast sky! Tio Claus was outdoing a modern aircraft!<br/>
"ORA ORA ORA ORA ORA-, you got slightly left behind! Put your strength into your ass! This damned hopeless dragon-"<br/>
"AHIIIIIIIH! I CAME! I’M COMING TO BEYOND THE SKYYYYYYYY-"<br/>
「Just what the hell-. Please no more-. Someone HELP MEEEEEEEEE-」<br/>
The sky was blue. The wind was refreshing, and the sea of clouds was beautiful.<br/>
Amidst such magnificent nature, three different roars from three different people were……<br/>
It was truly chaotic.<br/>
 <br/>
 <br/>
A while after the chaos had spread throughout the azure sky.<br/>
"Hics……"<br/>
「Don’t cry, Tio. You set a new record you know? You are without a doubt the fastest living thing in history. You are amazing. In various meanings.」<br/>
There was the figure of Tio who was flying at a normal speed while sobbing and Hajime who was consoling her.<br/>
It stood to reason that Tio who reached the realm of four times the speed of sound, even though it was just for a moment, was unmistakably an existence that had deviated from the scope of living beings and could be said to have entered the realm of god. But, even so, she was unable to match the endurance of the near future type aircraft of another world that could maintain such a speed continuously. In the end, she was left behind like this and had her pride hurt.<br/>
"It’s vexing, how vexing"<br/>
「Come on, stop crying already. You are amazing okay.」<br/>
Hajime exposed a gentle expression that was unthinkable to be coming from the person who just now was exhibiting storm-like whipping while laughing loudly. He was patting *pon pon* and caressing Tio’s black scales.<br/>
To be given the carrot after the whip, Tio drew in her tears of vexation and continued「But……」while being enveloped in an aura of happiness.<br/>
"We let go of a source that we couldst finally communicate with. What wouldst we do from here, Goshujin-sama?"<br/>
「H~m, let’s see. We can return to the floating island and investigate the cause of the island’s ability to float, but we have flown quite a distance away from there. Let’s try and go for a bit in the direction that guy was flying.」<br/>
"Well, in this first place, this art an aimless adventure, so I don’t mind that."<br/>
While saying such a thing, the two continued to carefreely fly in pursuit of someone who they had no idea of how far he had escaped.<br/>
Sometimes Hajime would change their route randomly by saying things like「Let’s try going over there」or「Let’s try going toward that cloud」. Tio would tilt her head thinking「He is not in the mood for chasing anymore?」, but even so, there wasn’t any particular reason for her to object so she would continue flying following his instructions.<br/>
Like that, they must have flown continuously for half a day.<br/>
Midway through they discovered several floating islands while advancing past the scenery that wasn’t really changing. The time was finally starting to enter a period in which the sun was starting to sink below the other side of the sea of clouds.<br/>
Inside the world that was painfully beautiful and dyed in a madder red color, it appeared.<br/>
「Hee. This thing is also really big. Is this a mothership I wonder?」<br/>
"……It’s not clear if this is the place where that guy escaped to. Well, though it doth not feel like we art mistaken based on the direction and distance."<br/>
「Ou. We aren’t mistaken.」<br/>
For a moment, Tio directed a really speechless expression at Hajime, but then she immediately pulled herself together and asked「What wouldst we do?」<br/>
Hajime displayed a thinking gesture while staring at the thing ahead of his gaze.<br/>
It was a large flying warship vacantly shining dull grey from the illumination of the sun’s orange light. Its shape was similar to a blimp in Earth’s terms. It had a small but wide shape like a rugby ball. When thinking about how it was made from metal and its shape, it was common to come to the conclusion that it was unsuited for flying; however, it was giving off a definite sense of stability even when seen from afar. It was ejecting sparkling silver particles from the back while flying with considerable speed.<br/>
Its size was about as big as two aircraft carriers on Earth. After looking closely at it, there were countless cylindrical protrusions on its exterior. There was no need to guess that those were weapons on board the ship. Countless small square hatches were lined up. There was no doubt that those were for the loaded weapons like missiles or the like.<br/>
‘This is becoming even more like SF’ ――Hajime was thinking of such a thing while speaking out their plan.<br/>
「Yosh, the situation changed from pure fantasy to semi-SF. We too will job change from adventurer to spy.」<br/>
"H, hmm? In other words, we art going to infiltrate?"<br/>
「Yeah, somehow I’m getting thrilled. Tio, dispel your transformation. We are sneaking into that mothership overflowing with romance――Golia○ with a camouflaging artifact fully deployed.」(TN: Goliath is a destroyer ship in Laputa)<br/>
"It feels like that temporary name art telling the fate that ship wouldst meet though……the flag of its sinking art as likely as a certain Titani○-san"<br/>
Tio responded while emitting a bright flash from her transformation cancellation. She was hovering with her wings that were still showing due to her using partial transformation. Hajime also took out a skyboard from "Treasure Warehouse II" that he rode on. He activated a pencil Cross Velt and deployed a barrier for camouflage.<br/>
「Do those guys have the technology that can break our camouflage……we won’t know until we try it.」<br/>
「What wouldst we do if we art discovered?」<br/>
「Of course, we will have a peaceful dialogue. After all, I am a virtuous and exemplary Japanese citizen. If I tell them that I’ll at least spare their lives if they hand over the guy that was screwing around before this, then surely both sides will be able to build a friendly relationship.」<br/>
「Goshujin-sama, that’s a joke correct? Thy face art serious and thy voice art flat, but that’s a joke correct? Isn’t that right?」<br/>
Hajime didn’t answer. Since ancient times, a good Japanese boy was a taciturn person!<br/>
In a state that was without sound, without shape if seen from outside, and furthermore, without heat that could be detected, the two of them approached sii~~lently from behind the mothership. They could feel how big it was the closer they got.<br/>
The two who arrived above the mothership removed their skyboard and wings before landing on the edge of a giant deck.<br/>
「……This is some unknown metal, but it doesn’t have any particular effects. I guess it’s just some normal metal.」<br/>
「So this thing art floating not because of the metal.」<br/>
Hajime whispered while kneeling on the deck with his hand crawling on the smooth floor. Tio was paying attention to the surroundings, but there weren’t any signs of humans being on the deck. In the central part, there was an out of place room that seemed to be the control room of the mothership. They could see glimpses of human silhouettes across the windbreak. They couldn’t decide whether that place was really the control room or just a watchtower, however.<br/>
「Goshujin-sama. Although we hath an invisibility barrier, I just couldst not calm down no matter what by staying for long in a place this open. I couldst see something like an entrance over there; how about we hath a look for now?」<br/>
「I guess. I’m curious about the material and some other things but……well, I can just take some samples with me.」<br/>
Hajime said such a thing as he casually tore off a railing and stored it into the "Treasure Warehouse II". The area around ten meters away from the door that seemed to be the entrance became uneven as though it had been gnawed at by worms.<br/>
What a natural vandalism & larceny. Police officer, catch this demon king, please.<br/>
Whether he actually noticed the amazed expression of Tio behind him, Hajime, whose mood to be stealthy was nonexistent despite being in the middle of an infiltration, was advancing across the deck briskly until they were in front of the door that connected to the inside. He covered the whole door with a barrier so as to not ring any alarms from the difference in air pressure and the like, and he put his hand on the door to investigate if there were any traps.<br/>
He then used transmutation and changed the door into a mere hole and stepped inside with a casual attitude. Tio followed in, and the door was returned to its former shape again with transmutation. Lock or anything was meaningless in front of a transmutation master.<br/>
「For now, infiltration successful.」<br/>
「How strange. This art different from the type of infiltration that I know though.」<br/>
Hajime nodded in satisfaction that there weren’t any alarms that triggered. Tio’s expression was really complicated.<br/>
Both of them paid attention to any presence in their surroundings while advancing forward. They steadily progressed through the passage of smooth metal. Several places were gouged out by Hajime-san’s hand. He was like someone who was using a coin to scratch cars on the roadside while casually strolling. It was truly a nasty prank (?).<br/>
「The driving mechanism is likely to be at the rear of the hull. Also, that area located at the highest position must be the watchtower or the control room.」<br/>
「Those sparkling particles must be one of the reasons why the island art floating. Then, should we search the rear hull first?」<br/>
Hajime thought for a bit before nodding at Tio’s suggestion.<br/>
「Yeah, I want to quickly carve the meaning of regret into that guy who got away, but well, we know he is inside this ship anyway so we can leave him for later.」<br/>
「……Right.」<br/>
Both of them vaguely headed toward the rear hull. In contrast with how big the ship was, the corridors inside were unexpectedly narrow. Three people walking side by side would feel cramped.<br/>
Naturally, on the way, they encountered a lot of the ship’s crew.<br/>
Hajime and Tio were able to detect the other party’s position using "Presence Detection" before they bumped into each other, so they were to keep advancing forward without being discovered.<br/>
Even in the case in which they encountered a small group inside the small corridor, they would just jump to the ceiling and pierce the ceiling with fingers thrust in order to cling there until the group passed by, or by creating an appropriate gap in the wall using transmutation and push their bodies into there until the group passed.<br/>
The mood was really like a certain spy movie somewhere. Hajime’s expression was expressing enjoyment as though his childlike innocence had returned to him.<br/>
By the way, when they were clinging onto the ceiling, Hajime would turn into something like human hammock to take ahold of Tio, and when they slipped into the gap created in the wall, Hajime would embrace Tio tightly, so Tio herself was also having a lot of fun with it while feeling embarrassed and happy.<br/>
「It seems there art a proper country existing. They look like military personnel. Their ethics art low, but they hath obedience for the chain of command.」<br/>
「Yeah. They are a proper military with a pecking order divided into ranks. The fact that the military can deploy an expedition of this scale means that their country also has quite the scale to it.」<br/>
The two made their conjecture based on the figures of the crew who were wearing unified uniforms with different color schemes, the conversation the two overheard, and in addition, how the weapons the crew were armed with were obviously guns that were also uniformly made.<br/>
Even while conversing like that, the two were enjoying their game of spy make-believe to their heart’s content as they slipped through several doors, passed through several spacious rooms, and descended several stairs before they came out into a particularly large corridor on the lowest floor. Wherein they suddenly smelled an unpleasant smell.<br/>
Hajime and Tio looked at each other’s face with a grimace at the familiar offensive smell and followed the smell as though they had been invited.<br/>
They could hear voices from the other side of the corridor’s corner. Both of them peeked out from the corner.<br/>
「Oi, did you hear? Those guys from Glowser squad, they were all annihilated except for Higgs.」<br/>
「Is that, true? Just what in the world happened huh. Was it those Avenst bunches?」<br/>
「Might be. But among the Glowser squad that went out for supplies, it’s only the messed up Higgs who came back in terror. That one seems true. Is it that scary just being attacked by that bunch?」<br/>
「That’s……perhaps, they used a new weapon?」<br/>
「You think that bunch has that kind of power huh. They are just air pirates that keep spewing out delusional words like tradition or pride or whatever you know?」<br/>
「Then, why do you think Higgs got that scared going against the like of that bunch?」<br/>
「Ain’t no way I know that even if you ask me.」<br/>
The two men were leaning on the corridor’s wall while speaking about several concerning topics. The source of the smell certainly came from those two. However, it was obvious from a glance. The reason was that their work clothes that looked like overalls were drenched in blood.<br/>
There was a large door in front of them. They must be doing some kind of work there that drenched them in blood. The two didn’t really want to imagine what was being done inside there. Most likely, the men were in the middle of their break right now.<br/>
「Well, anyway, it’s a fact that we lost four sky battlecraft. After all, we are ordered to extract spare fuel for aircraft like this.」<br/>
「You’re right.」<br/>
The two workers sighed at their comrades’ misfortune. It wasn’t clear how strong their feelings of fellowship were for their comrades from their conversation. However, it seemed certain that the work which drenched them with blood was necessary to replenish the sky battlecraft that Hajime shot down.<br/>
The two workers took a puff of something that seemed similar to a cigar before returning to the room while feeling that it was bothersome. When they entered, an intense smell――the smell of blood――was flowing from behind the opened door.<br/>
「Goshujin-sama.」<br/>
「Yeah, let’s go.」<br/>
The two’s personality weren’t so cute that they would falter just from the smell of blood after this far. In order to ascertain the true identity of the "fuel" that was the source to make the sky battlecraft, and perhaps also this mothership and the floating island to float, Hajime and Tio approached the room.<br/>
The door was a sliding type, most likely it would automatically close after a certain amount of time. Hajime and Tio slipped inside the room before the sliding door closed.<br/>
And then, they witnessed it. The cause of why those pilots were trying to capture the dragons alive. And also the true form of the "fuel".<br/>
Inside, the room was spacious. It had the height of two floors with a length and width that could reach a hundred meters. Three sides of the room were made from cages without any gaps in between. There was some kind of work stand in the middle of the room. Several things that looked like cranes and arms were protruding from the ceiling and floor.<br/>
The cages were filled with dragons and nothing else. The dragons’ sizes, colors, and shapes were varied, but they were living things that were obviously dragons from a glance. There were also grey dragons like the dragons they were playing with at the previous island. Even the biggest of the dragons here didn’t surpass three meters, and most were only small dragons with a size around one or two meters. There were also dragons with a size of around thirty centimeters among them.<br/>
The center of the room was truly in akin to a sea of blood. There was a large work stand with a dragon was lying down on it being pinned in place by several arms. The dragon didn’t have any light in its eyes, and blood was still flowing from its ripped open chest onto the floor.<br/>
There were around ten workers when including the previous two. One of them was carefully washing a small silver stone that had just been taken out of the dragon.<br/>
The stone was then placed into a machine nearby, and after the worker confirmed something that was displayed by the machine, he handed the stone over to another worker. The worker who received the small silver stone inserted it into another machine and controlled the machine while confirming something several times.<br/>
The small stone, which had an uneven shape before this, was then processed into a clean square chip.<br/>
The silver stone that was processed into a square chip was then handed off to another worker. That worker inserted the chip into the bottom of a cylindrical machine that looked like a thermos with a cord connected to it. And then, after he pressed several buttons, the meter display on the side of the cylindrical machine was starting to shine silver from below sequentially.<br/>
After witnessing up to that point, Hajime muttered with a small sound and expressionless face.<br/>
「……I see. So the dragons of this world also have something like a magic stone.」<br/>
「And by processing that, they couldst obtain this "fuel".」<br/>
Tio who nodded beside Hajime was similarly expressionless like Hajime in contrast with her comprehending words. Her voice had no intonation at all.<br/>
「Surely the floating island also has similar ore like that. ……Geez, it would be a fantasy world banzai if this ended just with that. This really left a bad taste.」<br/>
「But, just because of that, we couldst not stop them or resent them. For them who are living in the sky because of the polluted land, dragon hunting art truly a matter of life and death. Perhaps obstructing them from doing that art the same as saying ‘die’ to them after all.」<br/>
「Yeah.」<br/>
To say further, because Tio was a person of the dragon race, she had just a little emotional attachment toward dragon species, but even so, if it was said that these dragons were monsters unrelated to her, then that’s that. Even on Tortus, she wouldn’t hesitate to exterminate a monster of the dragon species.<br/>
But, as expected, the likable dragons she first met in this world flashed in the corner of her mind. Therefore, there was no way she could think nothing about this work of making dragons into battery replacements.<br/>
It was just as Hajime said, even though they could understand what they were doing, it left a "bad taste" inside.<br/>
「Let’s go Tio. It’s enough already.」<br/>
「Right.」<br/>
They had seen and known something disgusting――Hajime and Tio left the room with such a feeling. The weak cry of the dragons that sometimes reached their ears sounded like a cry for help to the two of them. Even though they knew that it was just their imagination, they couldn’t help but sigh deeply.<br/>
Like that, Hajime and Tio were about to step out of the room. It was at that time,<br/>
*gouuun-*<br/>
A sound resounded to the bottom of their stomachs, along with the G-force that assaulted their bodies as though the ship was accelerating all at once.<br/>
The sudden change was nothing for Hajime and Tio, but several of the workers were stumbling or fell on their butt.<br/>
"Announcement from the control room. Sighting of Avenst is confirmed. This ship will enter battle mode from here on. All crew, go to your post right away. Repeat, this ship will enter battle mode from here on. All crew, go to your post right away."<br/>
At the same time as the shrilly alert sounded inside the ship, a broadcast to the whole ship resounded. The announcement from the control room commanded the sortie of the sky battlecraft squad; in addition, an order that commanded the workers in this room to hurry with the resupply was given.<br/>
The situation inside the ship suddenly turned chaotic. The workers put around ten of the cylindrical machines into a case and put the case on a trolley before going out of the room with fast steps.<br/>
Following them, Hajime exited from the room while opening his mouth with a pensive look.<br/>
「Avenst, is that the air pirates those guys talked about just now?」<br/>
「Perhaps so. It’s unknown whether this is a coincidence or inevitability, but it appears this wouldst be a battle.」<br/>
The two didn’t know the battle strength of the other party, but it was unthinkable for a regular army that belonged to a country could be done in by a "pirate" group at best.<br/>
However, even so, an army in possession of unknown battle strength would battle an enemy with similarly unknown strength. They would like to be spared from harmoniously staying inside this ship in the unlikely chance that this mothership was shot down.<br/>
「Let’s get out quickly. We grasped the cause of the floating phenomenon already, and I smell a bit of danger from the energy that might result from the destruction of the power reactor that grants the absurd propulsive force to this mothership. Let’s take some distance and watch the situation.」<br/>
「Right. That art the wise choice.」<br/>
Hajime was thoroughly ignoring the flurry of activity inside the ship while taking a shortcut outside by irresponsibly opening stair-shaped holes in the floor using transmutation before he opened his mouth as though he recalled something.<br/>
「Come to think of it, that survivor……if I remember correctly, his name is "Sniff" is it?」<br/>
「Indeed, I think that person kept sobbing without end since he encountered us, but his name art not Sniff, but "Higgs". Goshujin-sama, you only got the "i" correctly.」<br/>
「Well, it doesn’t matter if he is Hics or Huggs. Sorry, looks like we don’t get the time to beat him up.」<br/>
「Such a thing……I’m not really concerned about that. Just knowing that Goshujin-sama got angry for mine sake already made me need replacement panties.」<br/>
「No need to worry. I thought that might be the case, so I stocked panties for your use inside the Treasure Warehouse.」<br/>
「What, the? Thi, this art the first time I heard that.」<br/>
「Yue made me bring them. Some time ago there was a chance when I went out with just you, right? At that time, she said something like"Did you bring your handkerchief? Your wallet? Tio’s panties? Geez, it’s no good to be forgetful. Nn-".」<br/>
「What legal wife power……」<br/>
The two of them were having that kind of stupid conversation as though to wash off the unpleasant feelings from just a moment ago while Hajime used the hole that he arbitrarily opened in the hull to jump out from the mothership that was cruising at high speed to the outside where the winds were buzzing thunderously. Tio also jumped out after Hajime.<br/>
Hajime wasted no time riding his skyboard while Tio also revealed her dragon wings. They began to fly parallel with the mothership after they had gained some distance from it.<br/>
Hajime laid out a camouflage barrier that wholly covered both him and Tio then turned his gaze to what the mothership was pursuing.<br/>
The flying ship of the air pirates called Avenst had a similar shape to the mothership, but its size was only a third of the mothership. What was different from the mothership was that its rear hull wasn’t emitting silver particles but white light that even looked colorless.<br/>
The speed difference between the two sides was evident. The sky battlecraft that flew out from the mothership quickly caught up and began their offensive.<br/>
The airship of the air pirates endured the attack with skillful maneuvers while intercepting them using the weapons on board so that the sky battlecraft couldn’t get near. In addition, sky battlecraft were also launching from the airship of the air pirates, and they were also displaying splendid dogfighting techniques while protecting their ship from the assaulting enemy.<br/>
「It seems the air pirates are inferior when it comes to equipment and numbers, but their skills are better.」<br/>
「The speed difference art obvious, and their turning ability and weapons art also inferior at a glance, yet they art splendidly enduring. But……」<br/>
「Yeah, the difference in strength is hopeless.」<br/>
Yes, no matter how skilled the air pirates were, their battle strength was overwhelmingly insufficient. Even from a quick count, the difference in the number of sky battlecraft was three times. The power of their Vulcan and their missile weapon’s maneuverability were so weak that a spectator would want to avert their eyes from looking.<br/>
Most likely, the air pirates’ side would get shot down if they got hit by a single missile or several bullets from the Vulcan. In contrast, the sky battlecraft on the army side, putting aside the missiles, seemed like their battle capability wouldn’t be affected even if they got hit dozens of times just by the Vulcan of the air pirates’ sky battlecraft.<br/>
The air pirates were facing an enemy with several times their number. They couldn’t hope to shoot down the enemy without landing hits several times as many, and they also couldn’t shake off the enemy using speed. The preeminent skill of the pilots was displaying a miraculous defense that would make any spectator to sigh in admiration spontaneously, but it was obvious that too was only a matter of time.<br/>
「No matter how you look at it, it’s not that the air pirates came attacking, but they, unfortunately, got discovered by the army……something like that.」<br/>
「O, Goshujin-sama. It looks like the mothership of the air pirates art changing course. Hou, it seems they art planning to plunge into those clouds that look like a mountain range see?」<br/>
They could see a giant waterfall of clouds on the left side. The river of clouds was flowing down like the vapor of dry ice falling to the ground from the towering mountain range of clouds that looked like it continued until the end of the world. It was merely a place with a height difference among the sea of clouds, but when seen from the side, it indeed looked like a mountain range of clouds.<br/>
Inside the sea of clouds was a place where black rain that caused necrosis on the cells and fierce lightning were raging. Was the airship and sky battlecraft of the air pirates that seemed to have low specs able to endure that environment……?<br/>
No matter how they thought about it, this was obviously a sink-or-swim gamble. But, either way, it was only a matter of time until the air pirates were shot down at this rate. There was no doubt that the air pirates also believed they had no other choice than to make this gamble.<br/>
The airship of the air pirates was starting to swivel left as though drawing a large arc. It was already partly damaged from being shot several times by the army’s sky battlecraft. Even so, it was evading the powerful cannon and missiles from the mothership, so it was still an amazing skill that they were displaying.<br/>
Although, if it was asked whether they could escape like that,<br/>
「……It will be harsh.」<br/>
「Yes.」<br/>
The mothership was approaching until it arrived nearby. The nearer it got, the more accurate their bombing became. No matter how divine the skill of the pilot was, there would be nothing they could do if the distance was closed further than this.<br/>
It was really unthinkable that the air pirates would be able to reach the cloud mountain range.<br/>
Hajime and Tio were watching that sight. Of course, the two wouldn’t head out to give reinforcements. These people were the "pirates" of this world — the outlaws that ignored the rules which protected many. This wasn’t a good problem to be mucked up irresponsibly by people of another world who came just to fulfill their curiosity of wanting a bit of an adventure.<br/>
No matter the problematic moral of the army’s pilots, no matter how the "fuel" production left them with a bad taste, it was completely unthinkable for them to be the air pirates’ ally only because of that.<br/>
As expected, the environment and the way of living of the people in this world were a bit too severe for the two of them to purely have fun here――Hajime and Tio smiled bitterly. They didn’t have the disgusting hobby of purposely enjoying the death of many people, so they averted their gaze thinking to withdraw from this airspace.<br/>
But, the destiny or something following Hajime and co around wasn’t that good of a guy that would let them get away that simply. All the events that happened in the other world Tortus, tumbling into another world like this when they came out just for a little stroll, then how that world had ended already, furthermore, having the scene of a battle between two factions unfolding in front of their eyes like this……<br/>
――Piiiiiiiiiih<br/>
「Aa?」<br/>
「Mu?」<br/>
In the battlefield that was decorated with explosion roars, howling wind, and orange flame blasts, suddenly a high-pitched sound reverberated. It sounded like a blown whistle; however, there was a compelling desperation filled into that――crying voice.<br/>
Hajime and Tio reflexively returned their gaze to the battlefield and caught a presence of something small rapidly approaching them.<br/>
A small shining silver creature was flying and weaving its way through the orange gaps of the explosions and the light of the setting sun that illuminated from the interval of the sea of clouds and sky. It was a small but magnificent dragon.<br/>
「Piih. Piiiiiiih」<br/>
The small silver dragon was desperately flapping its wings while raising a cry that sounded like it would tear up its throat.<br/>
‘A lost dragon?’ Hajime and Tio thought doubtfully, but they immediately noticed something else. That small existence was staring straight at the two of them, no, more accurately it was staring straight at Tio.<br/>
Hajime looked at the pencil Cross Velts floating around them. They were functioning normally. The camouflage barrier was going strong. Their form, smell, and heat shouldn’t be possible to be detected. But, the small dragon heading in their direction was going straight toward Tio no matter how he looked.<br/>
Hajime suddenly brought his face closer to Tio and sniffed repeatedly.<br/>
「Wha, what is it, Goshujin-sama? As expected it’s embarrassing to have mine body suddenly sniffed at.」<br/>
「No, I’m wondering if you have a unique smell that even my artifact cannot hide.」<br/>
「……Right now, it shouldst not be wrong of me for thinking of wanting to hit Goshujin-sama.」<br/>
Tio who was unusually angry was pushing on Hajime’s face with her hand to create some distance while her cheeks were blushing slightly.<br/>
Even while they were doing that, the small dragon arrived at their position, 「Pii! Piih!」it was crying out while circling around the two. It appeared that it was really detecting their presence without any doubt whatsoever.<br/>
「Oi oi, what’s with it? It’s looking really desperate somehow.」<br/>
「……Don’t tell me, is it looking for help?」<br/>
Tio stared at the tiny dragon with an expression that was lost for words. She was wondering why a dragon that should be fearful of humans was trying to get involved with a human conflict. Hajime was also cocking his head in puzzlement.<br/>
But, the strange matter was continuing further.<br/>
Of all things, the air pirates that should be heading desperately into the cloud mountain range was greatly swiveling while bending their path. The direction the ship’s nose was pointing at――was in the direction of Hajime and Tio.<br/>
「What’s going on? Don’t tell me the camouflage barrier is really broken?」<br/>
「No Goshujin-sama. I’m only guessing, but this child might be the cause?」<br/>
「They are turning midair to chase after a small dragon when they are in the brink of being shot down at any moment? I seriously don’t understand what the meaning of this is.」<br/>
Perhaps the army also noticed the small dragon’s existence seeing how the air pirates changed course, as several sky battlecraft broke away from the frontlines and approached here. Even though they should be pressuring the greatly skilled air pirates’ sky battlecraft, they still approached the small dragon even if they left behind a hole in their side’s battle force.<br/>
At the same time, the sky battlecraft of the air pirates also ignored the defense of their own mothership and flew out toward the small dragon.<br/>
「……Just who in the world art thou?」<br/>
Tio unconsciously asked at the small dragon that was desperately pleading something. The air pirates that pursued the small dragon even if they had to throw away their life. The pursuing army that left behind the air pirates even though it was just a bit more before they could finish them off.<br/>
It was already obvious that this small silver dragon wasn’t just a mere stray dragon.<br/>
「Chih. I don’t know what’s going on, but at this rate, we will get dragged in. Tio, we are finished being a spectator. We are withdrawing from this airspace right away.」<br/>
「Mu, acknowledged.」<br/>
The two were curious about the small dragon’s existence, but it was out of the question for them to get saddled with an existence that was unanimously pursued by the army and air pirates. Hajime and Tio nodded at each other and tried to leave that place.<br/>
That moment, as though guessing the intention of the two, the small dragon blocked their route. And then, it began to emit silver right immediately after.<br/>
Tio and Hajime unconsciously stopped moving seeing the dazzlingly shining small dragon that looked solemn somehow. Inside their head, a pleading resounded. It sounded vaguely childish, yet filled with a greatly earnest feeling.<br/>
"Help-, help! King, please! Everyone, my friends, help them-"<br/>
They didn’t hear any clear words. But, that feeling was certainly conveyed to them.<br/>
Hajime and Tio couldn’t hide their bewilderment. They looked at each other while standing still.<br/>
Instantly, a sound wave impact assaulted the area.<br/>
「Piih!?」<br/>
「Uoh」<br/>
「Nuwah. This art from that time!」<br/>
It was the same sound wave attack that the sky battlecraft emitted at the floating island. Furthermore, this one had more power than that time. It even generated physical shockwaves that mercilessly attacked Hajime and others.<br/>
Naturally, Hajime and Tio weren’t damaged, but the small dragon wasn’t unharmed. The small dragon that was emitting a mysterious silver light got blown away by the impact and began falling limply as though its consciousness was cut off.<br/>
「Ah, hey, get a hold of thyself!」<br/>
Tio spontaneously leapt out and held the small dragon with both hands.<br/>
「Tio! Don’t daydream!」<br/>
「Nu?」<br/>
The sky battlecraft of the army passed through instantly. When Hajime gave her a warning, it was after the second plane following behind it had launched the missile that deployed the net like the time at the floating island.<br/>
The special net burst in front of her eyes and spread widely to envelop its target.<br/>
Hajime cut in between just before it could envelop Tio and the fainted little dragon.<br/>
「HAAH!!」<br/>
A yell containing fighting spirit. The magic power that was gushed out directionally was converted into physical impact due to the skill "Magic Shockwave". The crimson wave that possessed immense power blew away the cage net far away without any trouble.<br/>
After the second plane passed through, the third plane that was further approaching was decelerating while deploying something that looked like a hook from its lower part. Most likely it would use that hook to catch the cage net and carry it to the mothership.<br/>
The pilot of the approaching third plane opened his eyes wide in shock.<br/>
After all, just when they were about to capture the small dragon with beautiful coordination, suddenly a beautiful winged woman appeared midair and caught the small dragon in her embrace. Furthermore, the cage net was blown away by a crimson wave, and in the end, a man riding a flying board also appeared. That was why it was impossible for him not to be shocked.<br/>
Yes, Tio got out of the camouflage range when she leapt out, and Hajime also exposed himself because he fired the magic shockwave.<br/>
The tough-looking hook flying out from the rapidly approaching third plane’s lower part was about to hit Hajime, Tio, and the small dragon behind him.<br/>
The fingers of Hajime’s right hand bent like claws. He instantly swung his right hand toward the hook that almost hit him.<br/>
By doing that, what was left behind was the figure of Hajime that was reduced into a pile of meat and got sent flying――was naturally not what happened. There was only the sight of the torn apart wreckage disappearing into the sea of clouds.<br/>
The sky battlecraft that pursued after the army’s sky battlecraft swiveled greatly to avoid Hajime and Tio.<br/>
When Hajime sent a glance, as expected, the air pirates’ pilot was also showing a shocked expression as though his eyeballs were going to fly out. He looked really like「WHAT THE HELLLLLLLLLLLLL-」<br/>
「Tio, how is the dragon?」<br/>
「Hmm, looks like it just lost consciousness without any serious wound. ……Forgive me, Goshujin-sama. Because I unconsciously jumped out, we art dragged into something troublesome.」<br/>
Tio showed an apologetic face while approaching Hajime’s side. Hajime shrugged while smiling wryly to that.<br/>
「If your body moved by itself, then that must be the action that Tio wanted to do from her heart. Then I don’t really mind that. First of all, it’s too late already to say that we were dragged into some troublesome matter by this time. This kind of thing can also happen from putting on air as an onlooker.」<br/>
「Ye, yes. I see. Thank you Goshujin-sama.」<br/>
Tio’s lips loosened up greatly hearing Hajime’s indifferent speech. And then, for some reason, Tio seemed to be nestling even closer than before to Hajime.<br/>
Ahead of Hajime’s gaze, the scene of the air pirates’ airship approaching and the army’s mothership circling around the two of them was unfolding. The sky battlecraft were circling around Hajime and Tio in circles with wariness and bewilderment.<br/>
Seeing that kind of sight, Hajime’s wry smile deepened, and he muttered.<br/>
「Now then, first how about we try starting with some peaceful "talk".」<br/>
<br/>

Thank you very much too for the thoughts, opinions, and reports about misspelling and omitted words.<br/>
Just a little notice, the comic version that is in the middle of serialization in Overlap-sama’s homepage was updated.<br/>
Damn, seriously damn. The impact of the fight against the claw bear among other things is just damn.<br/>
It really has an impact, and I can enjoy Hajime in his early days in the abyss with another fresh feeling.<br/>
If you are interested, please take a look by all means!<br/>
The next update is planned to be for 6 P.M Saturday too.<br/>
