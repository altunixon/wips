    <p>Thank you everyone for reading the second volume of 『Cooking with Wild Game』.</p>

    <p>The structure of this volume is a little special, with a quarter of it being a side story that had never been published before.</p>

    <p>Like I explained in the afterword for the previous volume, this work is originally posted onto the web, and each chapter is written freely by me, without any set number of words.</p>

    <p>And so, in order to compile the chapters into a book, the previous volume was compressed a little, while a 30,000-word side story was added to this book.</p>

    <p>There is another way though, which is adding more words to the main story. I edited the story with this in mind, but realized that expanding the chapters unnecessary will disrupt the rhythm of the story, so I changed to using a side story to expend the page count instead.</p>

    <p>From the next volume onwards, if the word count of the main story falls short, I will think about what I need to do to give the story the best structure in order to make the story even better.</p>

    <p>The title of the side story is Apéritif, and it features Ai Fa from two years ago as the protagonist.</p>

    <p>Two years ago, her esteemed father passed away and she got into bad terms with the tribal chief clan. For Ai Fa, that was the most painful period of her life.</p>

    <p>I have been planning to write about Ai Fa before she met Asuta since a long time ago, so I’m very happy to write this. I thought about continuing until Ai Fa met Asuta, but that felt a little unnecessary, and I wanted to write about the key scenes better too. After changing my mind, that’s how the ending came about.</p>

    <p>Asuta is the protagonist of this work and also the clown character. Without him around, the comedic element will fall drastically. The atmosphere in the side story is worlds apart from the main story, making it a slightly bitter Apéritif, but I hope everyone will enjoy reading it.</p>

    <p>As for the main story, in order to make the vertical columns in the book easier to read, I did some editing and adjusted some parts that bothered me after reading through it.</p>

    <p>Like the previous volume, I did my best to satisfy first-time readers and readers who had to peruse my work online.</p>

    <p>The story will continue quietly.</p>

    <p>The next volume will revolve around Lutim house and unveil more about the Forest’s Edge.</p>

    <p>New characters will make their debuts. Kochimo-sensei already illustrated Asuta, Ai Fa, and many other denizens of the Forest’s Edge in a very ideal way; how will he portray these new characters? As the author, I’m brimming with anticipation.</p>

    <p>The next volume is rather long like the first volume, so I need to compress the content properly.</p>

    <p>I will do everything I can to bring out the best content and remove the fluff.</p>

    <p>Ara, there are quite a number of pages in this afterword.</p>

    <p>Asuta and company will weave more stories in the future, and I will be elated if everyone can continue reading.</p>

    <p>Finally, I want to thank my editor from HOBBY JAPAN, the illustrator Kochimo-sensei, all the staff who helped in the publishing of this volume, and, once again, I want to give my gratitude to all the readers who bought this book. Let’s meet again in the next volume!</p>

    <p>March 2015, EDA</p>
