15-Intermission: Hero's Break<br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
"N-no way! It's curry riceeeeeee!"<br/>
<br/>
The moment the hero saw the curry set lined up on the table, he stood up and shouted out loud.<br/>
He vigorously turned around toward me, so I nodded and told him, "It's the real thing."<br/>
<br/>
We're in the annex of the inn reserved for the hero so there's no problem, but I wish he turns down the voice a bit.<br/>
<br/>
"Let's eat!"<br/>
<br/>
The hero put the spoon with curry rice into his mouth while choking full with tears of gratitude.<br/>
He's too overenthusiastic I was afraid that he'd scatter the curry rice everywhere but it appears to be an imaginary fear.<br/>
<br/>
"So goooooooooooooooood"<br/>
<br/>
The hero shouted once and then he gulped down the curry rice sloppily.<br/>
<br/>
"Curry really is a drink."<br/>
"No no, that's wrong."<br/>
<br/>
I objected Arisa's remark, and offered the dishes to the hero's followers.<br/>
<br/>
"The stew has some peculiar smell doesn't it?"<br/>
"It's spicy, but tasty y'know."<br/>
"I'm not good with spicy things."<br/>
"Ara? Even though it's this good."<br/>
<br/>
Miss Wiyaryi the longearkin (booch) archer and Rusus the tiger ear-kin were happily eating the curry, but Fifi the wolf ear-kin sniffed the scent and backed away from the plate.<br/>
Loreiya the priestess is elegantly eating the curry while combing her hair upward.<br/>
<br/>
"Give it to me if you're not eating them."<br/>
<br/>
The hero moved Fifi aside and quickly snatched her plate.<br/>
Wait now, stop that, you can have seconds all you want.<br/>
<br/>
"Ah, so this is the legendary curry!"<br/>
"It's the phantom dish of which the founder hero sought all his life."<br/>
<br/>
Sera's big sister, Lady Ringrande the [Sky-tearing Witch] and Princess Maryest the [Witch] are trembling from being deeply moved, they don't seem to be able to put the curry on the spoon.<br/>
Come to think of it, Hikaru and Lady Karina also reacted similarly when I served them curry.<br/>
<br/>
"Fifi-san, please try this one if you don't like spicy food."<br/>
"Oh, that smells nice."<br/>
<br/>
When I offered her a normal omelette rice, Fifi's wolf ears twitch and then she peeks at the plate.<br/>
<br/>
"Hee? An egg dish? It looks like the omelette in Saga Empire."<br/>
"Omelette! I-is this red sauce carrot?"<br/>
<br/>
Seina the scout and Nono the secretary who were eating the curry behind the hero came and peered at Fifi's plate from both sides with great speed.<br/>
<br/>
"T-this is mine!"<br/>
<br/>
Fifi, worried about the two's enthusiasm, hides the omelette rice like she's hugging it.<br/>
<br/>
"Fifi, let me have a bite."<br/>
"I want to eat it too!"<br/>
<br/>
Nono and Seina pestered Fifi.<br/>
<br/>
"I can't trust your 'a bite'"<br/>
"How rude! Unlike Seina, my mouthful is cute."<br/>
"Hey, mine is cute too!"<br/>
<br/>
"Thank you for waiting~?"<br/>
"Additional dishes nanodesu."<br/>
<br/>
I wanted to see the three's bargaining a bit more, but since Tama and Pochi showed bringing additional dishes, I decided to put an end to the dispute.<br/>
<br/>
"It seems more omelette rice have come, would you two like to taste it?"<br/>
"Yay!"<br/>
"Sir Pendragon is a bully."<br/>
<br/>
Seina immediately got into the omellete rice, Nono put the omellette rice into his mouth while glaring at me.<br/>
<br/>
"It's not, carrot? What sauce is this?"<br/>
"Toumatoo~?"<br/>
"Kechup nanodesu!"<br/>
"Tomato kechup sauce is it?"<br/>
<br/>
Nono combined Tama's strangely good pronunciation and Pochi's Japanese pronunciation together.<br/>
<br/>
"The sauce is ketchup made from tomato. It's a product from Ringrande-sama's hometown, Oyugock Dukedom."<br/>
<br/>
Lady Ringrande reacted to my explanation.<br/>
<br/>
"Satou? I've never seen that sauce though?"<br/>
"Nn, Satou."<br/>
"Master developed it, so I refer."<br/>
"Hee, as one would expect from the 『Miracle Chef』."<br/>
<br/>
Explained by Mia and Nana, Lady Ringrande called me with a nostlagic title.<br/>
<br/>
Then, Lulu and Liza come into the room pushing a trolley with a big sukiyaki pot on it.<br/>
<br/>
"Sorry to keep you waiting. This is Oumi beef sukiyaki."<br/>
"Sukiyaki!"<br/>
<br/>
The hero who had asked for his fifth helping turned toward Lulu while having his yellowed mouth wiped by Priestess Loreiya.<br/>
<br/>
"Yes, it's a dish from Hero-sama's country."<br/>
<br/>
Lulu doesn't act differently even though the other party is the hero.<br/>
She probably thinks people who eat her dishes with relish are the same as our girls.<br/>
<br/>
"Would you like to have raw eggs?"<br/>
"Ou, I do!"<br/>
<br/>
On the contrary Liza who's acting unusually tense handed a plate with raw eggs.<br/>
I'm praying that her trembling hands aren't because of warrior's excitement.<br/>
<br/>
"Me-meat."<br/>
"Meat nanodesu. But Pochi has to wait since right now it's 『Wait』 nodesu."<br/>
<br/>
Tama and Pochi are staring at the beef inside sukiyaki while drooling.<br/>
<br/>
--Huh? I never ordered them as such though?<br/>
<br/>
"I thought of letting Hayato and the others to eat first."<br/>
"You did huh. However, there's no need to worry, I've prepared enough for us all."<br/>
<br/>
It seems Arisa is the culprit.<br/>
<br/>
This time, I obtained the meat by imitating Weasel Empire way to increase meat production.<br/>
Since I harvested the transformation of Oumi cow when it reached level 50, the <<Great Mad Buffalo>>, I was able to get more than 100 ton beef.<br/>
<br/>
It doesn't taste as good as the highest grade Oumi beef, but it should not taste that different for the part used in Sukiyaki.<br/>
<br/>
"I've also asked Lulu to make another dish, it should be here soon I think?"<br/>
<br/>
As if matching Arisa's words, brownie maids open the door and carry hamburg steaks and karaage inside.<br/>
<br/>
"Hamburgu~?"<br/>
"It is the time for the hamburg steak sensei to appear nanodesu!"<br/>
<br/>
Tama and Pochi turn their, "Can I eat it?", faces at me so I nod to give them the permission.<br/>
<br/>
"Wa~y?"<br/>
"Pochi's battle has just begun nanodesu!"<br/>
<br/>
Not only Tama and Pochi, the other girls also begin to eat.<br/>
<br/>
"Is that good?"<br/>
"Of coursee~?"<br/>
"Gimme one too."<br/>
"Of course nanodesu! Hamburg-sensei is big hearted nodesuyo!"<br/>
<br/>
Fifi and Rusus who had finished eating omelette rice and curry joined the subjugation quest for the mountain of hamburg steaks.<br/>
It seems the yakitori battlefield which Liza is challenging are joined by Miss Wiyaryi and Miss Loreiya who has secured a bottle of Dragon Spring Liquor.<br/>
<br/>
While watching the peaceful exchange of the girls and hero's followers, I accept a wine cup that Lady Ringrande offered. <br/>
It seems there's Saga Empire whiskey inside.<br/>
<br/>
"Satou, thank you. I didn't think that Hayato would be able to laugh that cheerfully until we defeated the demon lord."<br/>
"Yes, the atmosphere of torment around him has disappeared neatly. You're the best reinforcement we can ever hope."<br/>
<br/>
I replied Lady Ringrande and Maryest who were awfully flattering with, "It's an honor", toasted and drank the whiskey.<br/>
<br/>
--Oops.<br/>
<br/>
I immediately regret once I drank it.<br/>
I should have tasted it more.<br/>
<br/>
"This is a nice whiskey."<br/>
"Yes, it's a special whiskey bestowed with the name 『Saga』 that can only be drunk by the imperial family."<br/>
"Is it alright to give such a precious whiskey to me?"<br/>
"Yes, it's nothing compared to the Dragon Spring Liquor which Loreiya monopolizes."<br/>
<br/>
It's true that you can't get ahold of Dragon Spring Liquor no matter how much money you throw.<br/>
<br/>
"I also have various others--"<br/>
<br/>
Saying that, I took out three small bottles with different kinds of Dragon Spring Liquor inside.<br/>
In addition to the Ancient Dragon's and the Black Dragon's liquor, there's also one created with my Dragon Language Magic.<br/>
<br/>
"I smelled some delicious liquor."<br/>
<br/>
Soft mass and sexy drunk voice descend upon my back.<br/>
<br/>
When I turn around, there's Miss Loreiya with flushed face at close proximity.<br/>
Her arms are reaching the liquor bottles over my shoulders so my back feels really blissful.<br/>
<br/>
"Loreiya, calm down a bit."<br/>
"Look, Satou is troubled."<br/>
<br/>
Princess Maryest reproved, Lady Ringrande pulled my hand to save me from Miss Loreiya's assault.<br/>
<br/>
"Ara?"<br/>
"Kyaa."<br/>
<br/>
Perhaps it's a blessing from Lucky Lewd God, I ended up diving into Lady Ringrande's lap together with Miss Loreiya.<br/>
Of course it was possible for me to evade it with all my might, but this time I decided to respect the god's will and enjoyed the softness. The impregnable fortress pair is busy treating the hero after all.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
◇<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Now then, right at this time the hero is--.<br/>
<br/>
"So many loli maids?! I-Is this heaven!"<br/>
<br/>
Staring at the brownie maids with the best smile he's ever had, choke full of tears of gratitude.<br/>
I think his reaction is even greater than the time with the curry, but pointing that out would be boorish of me.<br/>
<br/>
"Hero-sama."<br/>
"P-Princess Arisa, this is a misunderstanding."<br/>
<br/>
The hero was shaken by Arisa's word.<br/>
<br/>
After this, as to what he would do after knowing that the loli maids are [Legal Loli], there is no way of knowing that for I am not a god.<br/>
I'm certain that his soul is surely the embodiment of [YES! Lolita, NO! Touch.]<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
◇<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Thus the night grows late, and the party transitions to drinking time, I let the girls to go back to their room and switch to adult social time.<br/>
<br/>
"Satou, you think we can win?"<br/>
"I have no doubt that Hayato-sama will win."<br/>
<br/>
Tomorrow is going to be the end of the demon lord, so I'll make him win no matter what.<br/>
<br/>
Moreover, judging from the demon lord's level, he should have been able to win easily if there was no intervention from the [Dungeon Master].<br/>
<br/>
"That so! I feel like I will certainly win when you said so!"<br/>
"Yes, that's what it means to be the 『Hero of Saga Empire』."<br/>
"Yea, damn right!"<br/>
<br/>
The hero's cheerful laughter echoes in the party hall, his friends who see him like that seem to have relaxed too.<br/>
<br/>
Subjugating the demon lord should be easy now.<br/>
<br/>
