<br/>
Wow, it’s been a month since I started doing this……time sure does fly. The last paragraph about games was particularly difficult, so I would appreciate it if someone went and translation checked it.<br/>
Being Companions to The Hero of The Sword<br/>
Firo:"Welcome back Master~"<br/>
After returning to the hotel at the main island, Firo greets me at the main entrance.<br/>
I wonder. I have a very bad feeling about this.<br/>
Naofumi:"I’m back. How was it?"<br/>
Firo:"Nn~…..Umm you see. Onee-chan got angry."<br/>
Naofumi:"Not again……"<br/>
I wonder what the reason is-……While hunting together with Ren’s companions I had a foreboding feeling.<br/>
I enter the hotel timidly.<br/>
There I see Raphtalia, sitting where Motoyasu was last time waiting for me.<br/>
Naofumi:"Where is Ren?"<br/>
I mutter while looking around.<br/>
As I say so, from the entrance of the hotel Ren walks in.<br/>
Should I heard what he has to say before speaking to Raphtalia?<br/>
Ren:"Y-You……"<br/>
Ren sees me and his facial expression turns grim.<br/>
Ren:"What is with your companions? They don’t listen to my instructions and go to other hunting grounds without my permission."<br/>
What’s that? He’s speaking like he’s the victim.<br/>
Even if Ren is blaming her, Raphtalia is not one to cause problems without reason.<br/>
Ren:"If you don’t mind, I would like to point out that the problem lies with your training policy."<br/>
I determined that I should hear it with Raphtalia.<br/>
I don’t really want to approach Raphtalia, so I’ll just call her over.<br/>
Naofumi:"Heeey"<br/>
Raphtalia:"Naofumi-sama! And……"<br/>
When Raphtalia sees me she smiles, but once she finds Ren, it turns into an angry look and her tail bristles up.<br/>
I think that she is even angrier than that time with Motoyasu.<br/>
Naofumi:"What the hell did you really do?"<br/>
It wasn’t simple when Motoyasu angered Raphtalia that much.<br/>
To be honest, I am a little anxious to find out what upset Raphtalia so much.<br/>
Ren:"No clue, she just operated as she pleased."<br/>
Raphtalia:"As I please? Don’t joke around!"<br/>
When Raphtalia approached and heard Ren’s complain she snapped.<br/>
Raphtalia:"This person–"<br/>
This is Raphtalia’s description of the events.<br/>
After I left, Raphtalia was becoming anxious when waiting for Ren, due to what happened with Motoyasu.<br/>
Firo:"Is someone coming today?"<br/>
Raphtalia:"Yes, like Naofumi-sama who is a hero, the person coming today is called Ren-sama."<br/>
Firo:"Hmph."<br/>
Much earlier than Motoyasu, Ren showed up at the room."<br/>
Ren:"I’m coming in."<br/>
Raphtalia:"Please."<br/>
Ren enters the room after a knock.<br/>
The first impression Ren received seemed to be a more tranquil feeling compared to Motoyasu.<br/>
If anything, Ren doesn’t talk very much.<br/>
Ren:"First of all I’ll introduce myself. I am Amaki Ren, also known as the Hero of the Sword. My best regards for these next two days."<br/>
Raphtalia:"My best regards. My name is Raphtalia."<br/>
Firo:"Firo."<br/>
Ren crosses his arms and looks at Raphtalia and Firo from head to toe.<br/>
An awkward atmosphere was covering the area.<br/>
Raphtalia:"Umm……"<br/>
Ren:"Levels?"<br/>
Raphtalai:"What?"<br/>
Ren:"Tell me what level you are."<br/>
Raphtalia:"Ah, sure it’s 42. Firo is the same as well."<br/>
Firo:"Yep!"<br/>
Ren:"42 huh……Isn’t it impossible then?"<br/>
Raphtalia:"Eh?"<br/>
Raphtalia did not understand what he meant by saying it was impossible so suddenly.<br/>
Ren’s companions were the same, they did not ask for any explanations.<br/>
Maybe they got used to it after being together with him for so long.<br/>
Well due to following my efficiency principle……Rapthalia listens obediently.<br/>
Ren:"Oh well, let’s just go raise our levels for now."<br/>
While saying that Ren sends a party invite and Raphtalia accepts.<br/>
Ren:"Before we leave, buy some medicine if necessary."<br/>
Raphtalia:"Ah, Okay."<br/>
Though Ren is blunt, Raphtalia responds willingly since they will be leveling up properly.<br/>
Since I already distributed medicine, there was no need to buy any, thus they arrived at their island.<br/>
Ren:"Well then, I’ll judge how much you are able to fight. I will watch while we advance."<br/>
Raphtalia:"Yes……?"<br/>
Raphtalia has a sense of discomfort from the words Ren said.<br/>
And so, they fought demons that came from the mountain-side of the island.<br/>
Ren:"Hmm……well, the enemies around here should be at an appropriate level."<br/>
Raphtalia:"There is little resistance though……"<br/>
Firo:"Teei!"<br/>
Due to the Class up, Raphtalia and Firo’s offensive power rose considerably.<br/>
As a result, the few demons felt weak.<br/>
In fact, the enemies are being slaughtered with a single attack.<br/>
What would the appropriate level be? Actually, is it even something you can compare with game knowledge after seeing?<br/>
Ren:"This area is appropriate for level 40s. You guys continue leveling here, I’ll be heading somewhere else. Well, you guys seem pretty strong for level 40 anyway."<br/>
While leaving that message, Ren runs off from the party.<br/>
Those last words were a little unnecessary. If this is a net game, I’ll return.<br/>
Raphtalia:" Ah, Excuse me-"<br/>
Ren:"I’ll return in the evening. Fight until then. Gather the demons."<br/>
Raphtalia:"S-Sure……"<br/>
Though the demons were weak, they still gave good experience, so Raphtalia continued to defeat demons.<br/>
When it was evening, Ren returned and absorbed all the demons Rapthalia defeated into his sword.<br/>
Raphtalia had slight feelings of having her commission stolen from the demons she defeated herself.<br/>
Is she an NPC? Respect the other party a bit more.<br/>
Raphtalia:"That……"<br/>
Ren:"What’s up?"<br/>
Raphtalia:"Are we not going to fight together?"<br/>
Ren:"Your levels are not sufficient enough to fight. It is common sense for the weaker ones to make an effort to catch up."<br/>
……Raphtalia felt irritation at Ren’s attitude.<br/>
Do you lack common sense?……I feel there is a large gap of common sense between me and Ren.<br/>
If it was me, I would be going with them first and then ranking them.<br/>
But, in net games there are restrictions one experienced gained when the levels are too far apart, however in this world there doesn’t seem to be such a restriction.<br/>
Otherwise, when Firo was still a chick she would not have been able to level up so fast.<br/>
Anyway, after they entered the hotel they had a meal.<br/>
Ren:"Well I’m off to level up a little more. See ya."<br/>
After Ren says so, he leaves quickly.<br/>
Those words show that he is at least diligent in this world……Raphtalia convinced herself to go take a rest.<br/>
So, the next morning.<br/>
Ren:"What is your level now?"<br/>
Raphtalia:"Let’s see, it is 48 now."<br/>
Raphtalia and Firo both leveled from yesterdays fights.<br/>
By the way, even if they aren’t in the same party as me, the growth correction is still in effect since I am their master.<br/>
Ren:"Well……It might be a little harsh……"<br/>
Ren looks up and mutters to himself for a bit before answering.<br/>
Ren:"Let’s go deeper today. We’ll defeat demons together this time."<br/>
Raphtalia:"O-Okay."<br/>
Firo:"Okay~!"<br/>
Raphtalia was secretly relieved that she could finally have a proper fight.<br/>
But not even an hour passed before she noticed that was a big mistake.<br/>
Along the way, Ren asked about the magic and skills that Raphtalia and Firo could use.<br/>
So Raphtalia explained her illusion magic, and Firo’s sure-kill technique.<br/>
Ren:"Hmm……There was a similar skill, is it an original name?"<br/>
Raphtalia:"Huh?"<br/>
Ren:"Nevermind."<br/>
While crossing the mountainside, they entered the hinterland in the middle of the island.<br/>
A big demon with a single head called Karma Dog Familiar showed up.<br/>
It seems to be a demon with long ears, and it resembles a big black dog.<br/>
I wonder if the enemy was unpleasant enough to trigger Rapthalia’s trauma.<br/>
Ren:"Alright! You guys, fight as per my instructions!"<br/>
Raphtalia:"Okay!"<br/>
Firo:"What are we going to do-?"<br/>
Ren:"First, attract the demon’s attention and avoid its attacks. Then, use your finisher attacks on it!"<br/>
A very sloppy strategy.<br/>
Assault! Smash! Victory! Nothing is going to change.<br/>
Raphtalia gave up on attacking the Karma Dog Familiar according to instructions and dodged.<br/>
However, Ren was dodged to the spot first, so she had to move somewhere else.<br/>
Ren:"Don’t stay so close to me! Think about it!"<br/>
Raphtalia:"O-Okay!"<br/>
If it was me I would have praised her. While I think about it, Raphtalia and Firo pulled maximum aggro on the enemy.<br/>
Thanks to having never co-operated with Ren before, their timings didn’t match, and his order to prioritize dodging.<br/>
The result was, battle time was prolonged, and the battle with the Karma Dog continued while tiring out.<br/>
During the fight, Firo concentrated on attempting her arrow attack called High Quick.<br/>
Ren:"Meteor Sword!"<br/>
Firo:"Ah-! Move-!"<br/>
Just as Firo was charging out of the thicket, Ren appeared in front of her.<br/>
Due to that, the magic was forced to change direction and fail.<br/>
Karma Dog Familiar screamed and attacked Ren.<br/>
Ren:"Damn, so it was too shallow! What are you doing!? Hurry up and fight!"<br/>
Firo:"Fue-……?"<br/>
Raphtalia:"……Illusion Sword."<br/>
Ratphalia as uses her special skill and hides herself to attack the Karma Dog Familiar’s rear.<br/>
However.<br/>
Ren:"Tch!"<br/>
Ren failed an attack and dodged towards Raphtalia, while he clicked his tongue.<br/>
Raphtalia:"Wh-Why did you come here!?"<br/>
Ren:"Think about it a little!"<br/>
After a while the Karma Dog Familiar was finally defeated.<br/>
No wonder. Not only Raphtalia, but I am also getting irritated just listening to the story.<br/>
Ren:"Seriously, when you guys fight, look around a little! You guys should be focusing on attracting it’s attention!"<br/>
Ren told Rapthalia, while confirming the Karma Dog Familiar’s death.<br/>
Imediately afterwards, something inside of Raphtalia snapped.<br/>
Raphtalia:"Look around? That should be you!"<br/>
After watching Ren fight, Raphtalia brought it up.<br/>
First of all, the Karma Dog Familiar is a boss-class demon that Ren had trouble fighting with himself.<br/>
Also, during the fight, Ren was only focused on fighting alone.<br/>
The boss was one that even Firo’s kicks only bent it back slightly.<br/>
In Raphtalia’s honest analysis, it would have been stronger than the Zombie Dragon.<br/>
Raphtalia:"You are the one that lacks strategy. You were the one that told us to avoid the attacks and use our finishers. However, you kept blocking our way!"<br/>
Ren:"There is no mistake in my strategy. You guys just suck."<br/>
Raphtalia:"Please don’t joke around! I explained our finishers properly! Yet, why did you still obstruct us!?"<br/>
Ren:"I didn’t obstruct anything! You guys just had to attract the enemy’s attention."<br/>
Raphtalia:"Then why did you not explain it!?"<br/>
Ren:"You should have known from observation."<br/>
Raphtalia:"……Please stop it!"<br/>
Raphtalia’s patience reached the limit.<br/>
Raphtalia:"We do not get along well enough to co-operate together, there is no way we can fight together easily!"<br/>
Ren:"That’s why I am the damage dealer, defeating this guy–"<br/>
Raphtalia:"Honestly, you are a hinderance!"<br/>
Raphtalia personally disables the party and instructs Firo.<br/>
Ren:"Wha—-You, what are you doing without permission!"<br/>
Raphtalia:"Please remain silent!"<br/>
While wading through the bushes, another Karma Dog Familiar appears.<br/>
Raphtalia made a party with Firo who consented.<br/>
After that, Raphtalia and Firo killed the second Karma Dog Familiar in one-third of the time it took fighting with Ren.<br/>
Raphtalia:"We shall take our leave now. Since it is more inefficient with us here."<br/>
While being sarcastic, Raphtalia left with Firo and fought easily until evening.<br/>
Being concerned about the time wasted with Motoyasu, they hunted until it was very late.<br/>
Ren:"Do you think such selfishness will be permitted!?"<br/>
Raphtalia:"What are you arguing about. Whether or not I have permission……Who are you to decide?"<br/>
Ren:"What was that!?"<br/>
Truthfully…… He is talking with a lot of assumptions.<br/>
Requiring permission……It’s something that players get reported to administration for.<br/>
Naofumi:"Hey……You, who are you to give permission for anything?"<br/>
Ren:"……"<br/>
Ren averts my gaze and mumbles under his breath.<br/>
Did you say it carelessly in a fit of rage?<br/>
Still, I don’t think Raphtalia is in the wrong after all.<br/>
Though it wouldn’t be beneficial to leave on bad terms.<br/>
Naofumi:"Or do you really have such power? Raphtalia is my companion. If there is something she did wrong then I will punish her. If Ratphalia did something, then explain the reason so I can understand."<br/>
Ren:"Ku!"<br/>
Hey there, something might be said to Shadow later.<br/>
In any case, no matter the circumstance I will defend Rapthalia. There is no reason for her to do anything wrong.<br/>
Naofumi:"What do you think a companion is? Do you think they are a chess piece that attracts attention from the enemy so that it doesn’t come for you?"<br/>
In any case, this morning meeting……is even shorter than with Motoyasu?<br/>
Oh my……<br/>
Raphtalia:"If you keep doing such things, you will kill one of your companions someday!"<br/>
With that, Rapthalia angrily walks off back to the room.<br/>
Ren shrugs selfishly and glares at me.<br/>
Ren:"Your companion is selfish. Selfish people will die sooner."<br/>
That remark could be called the howling of a loser. I sigh while looking at the sky.<br/>
Ignoring your own rules and complaining……<br/>
What can I say, there are more important problems to be worried about.<br/>
Representative:"Are you alright? Ren-sama!"<br/>
Ren:"Yeah, it’s no big deal."<br/>
Ren walks off with his companions……It is a little ironic, it looks like he’s walking off with a junior in a guild.<br/>
I should stop worry about it.<br/>
There are such……types. Those people who follow rules without question, and those that make them selfishly.<br/>
There are those that will take their juniors to a strong hunting field and kill them off, there’s no meaning in co-operating.<br/>
With that said, I would rather not challenge someone who I might not be able to beat.<br/>
Well, that guy puts on a show of hunting alone. That might be the cause of their blind belief in Ren.<br/>
They are annoying in games, guys that only seem reliable at first.<br/>
When rare items appear those types monopolize the rare items. The only thing you can do is watch while that happens.<br/>
MO Type…… an episode is chosen while going through the story, in net games it’s possible to enjoy it by solo beating the last boss of the stage…… However when compared to a complete MMO game, the bosses there are terribly stronger.<br/>
(Tlnote: Multiplayer Online and Massively Multiplayer Online. ＭＯタイプ )<br/>
I remember attempting such challenges and some one not getting the equipment he wanted.<br/>
I remember the complaints of that guy.<br/>
His occupation has a strong finisher, and he used a junior to stall for time in order to shoot it.<br/>
In addition to challenging first-class dungeons, it was a wipe-fest for members. Those that usually played solo would start complaining.<br/>
And then, when participating in fights at a high level, their friends were unable to catch up.<br/>
There are some net terms fit that hero-sama. There are various other nicknames as well. Besides, those that don’t abide by the rules and slander others are reported to administration.<br/>
since I also ran a guild, I remember having to ban a few of those types.<br/>
I thought he would be a bit more competent, was it just my misunderstanding?<br/>
I didn’t think there would be someone besides Motoyasu that would anger Raphtalia so much.<br/>
This……Itsuki might also cause something as well.<br/>
