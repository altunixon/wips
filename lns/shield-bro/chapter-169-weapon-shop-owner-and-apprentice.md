<br/>
I feel like my translations seem to keep getting worse‚Ä¶but everyone probably can‚Äôt tell because they compare it to all the machine translations üòê<br/>
Anyway~ thank you for all your patience (:<br/>
I‚Äôll be editing 170~172 and fixing them up before I re-post them on Ohanashimi.<br/>
The weapon shop‚Äôs apprentice<br/>
"Yaaahhhhhh!" (firo)<br/>
"Firo-taaa‚Äï‚Ä¶.." (motoyasu)<br/>
I saw Motoyasu off with a sigh as he flew off into space for the third time today.<br/>
He‚Äôll probably arrive ahead of us with his transfer skill, but she did well.<br/>
"As I thought, being with the Hero of the Shield-sama is entertaining~" (sadina)<br/>
Sadina cackled with laughter at the sight of Motoyasu flying into space.<br/>
I feel like she was always laughing, but was that just my imagination?<br/>
Even Fohl screamed in the beginning. [T/N: When he first saw Motoyasu go flying]<br/>
I also saw the other guys drawing away but Sadina was the only one who laughed so readily.<br/>
Was she someone who laughs easily? How should I say it, I think it‚Äôs too much.<br/>
Oh well, one way or another, the castle came into view.<br/>
Fohl looked to be suffering from very bad motion sickness but we were nearly at our destination.<br/>
Returning with the transfer skill‚Ä¶‚Ä¶.I didn‚Äôt register my land or anything, so for the time being it‚Äôs not an option.<br/>
Well, I have various things to do in the castle so it‚Äôs fine.<br/>
Before we enter the castle town, I stop the carriage at the village nearby, like always.<br/>
"Heh, are we walking from here?" (sadina)<br/>
"Firo and I are famous, we stand out whenever we enter the castle town." (naofumi)<br/>
"Hmm. Well then, wouldn‚Äôt it‚Äôd be better for Fohl-kun to conceal himself as well, for the same reason?" (sadina)<br/>
"Why?" (naofumi)<br/>
"Melromarc has been in a feud with Silt Welt for a long time, you know? And the Hakuko species is renown because of it." (sadina)<br/>
Mmm‚Ä¶..there‚Äôs some truth in that. His appearance may be noteworthy.<br/>
"My kind is not seen very often but it‚Äôs fine since we‚Äôre not well-known." (sadina)<br/>
"I see." (naofumi)<br/>
It seems kind of stupid. We might stand out for a different reason, but let‚Äôs just go as eccentric adventurers.<br/>
It seems that the Lemo slave was fine for the same reason.<br/>
We were just going to leave him at the old man‚Äôs place. It was Imia‚Äôs uncle.<br/>
Was his a docile species?<br/>
Come to think of it, I haven‚Äôt been fighting at all lately.<br/>
I‚Äôm afraid my senses seem to be dulling.<br/>
I should also do some training exercises with the Battle Instructor.<br/>
Firo kept a restless lookout of our surroundings as she walked behind me.<br/>
Did she really hate Motoyasu that much.<br/>
If she hated him, she shouldn‚Äôt have given him such kind words.<br/>
I really didn‚Äôt want to tell her, but she should be more secretive about this fear.<br/>
What will you do when Motoyasu proceeds to the village?<br/>
We entered the castle town as I thought that.<br/>
It would probably be good to ask the queen to prepare for the Level Reset first.<br/>
Or, should I turn the slave over to the old man before that?<br/>
Well, we pass the old man‚Äôs shop on the way to the castle so the delegation is probably better.<br/>
"Oh, Laddie." (oyaji)<br/>
When we entered the weapon shop, the old man was standing at the counter as usual.<br/>
The shop seems to have settled down and stabilised. Well, I had confidence in the old man‚Äôs business.<br/>
"How is it? Is there any progress?" (naofumi)<br/>
"Not at all. The ore from the spirit turtle also has the characteristic of being tough." (oyaji)<br/>
"Hmm.." (naofumi)<br/>
"That part is very challenging right now but I‚Äôm researching everything I can." (oyaji)<br/>
"I see. Which reminds me, in Zeltbur I‚Äï" (naofumi)<br/>
I told the old man about the Spirit Turtle Sword I saw in Zeltbur. In any case, I could tell that it was a sword made by a skilled craftsman at a single glance.<br/>
"If you say so, it must have been quite a sword‚Ä¶.I can probably tell who made it or how they made it just by looking at it but‚Ä¶." (oyaji)<br/>
"I‚Äôd need to bring it here? Forgive me but such an expensive weapon is beyond me." (naofumi)<br/>
If I sell the weapons made by the old man, I could probably get a bit of money but that would be like putting the cart before the horse.<br/>
‚Ä¶.Speaking of which, I also have the option of selling the rare or unique weapons gained from the drops. Since they‚Äôre unusual, I should be able to get a good price for them.<br/>
I‚Äôll think about it.<br/>
"Oh right, I thought about who I should make your apprentice and brought the slave." (naofumi)<br/>
"Who is it?" (oyaji)<br/>
I pointed to Imia‚Äôs uncle among the slaves I brought.<br/>
"For a while now, I feel like I know you, but is that just my imagination?" (oyaji)<br/>
The old man inquired while pointing at Imia‚Äôs uncle.<br/>
"Why it‚Äôs been a long time. It looks like you‚Äôve graduated properly from the Master‚Äôs place." (imia‚Äôs uncle)<br/>
"As I thought!" (oyaji)<br/>
"You‚Äôre acquaintances?" (naofumi)<br/>
"Yeah." (oyaji)<br/>
"From the past." (imia‚Äôs uncle)<br/>
It seems that Imia‚Äôs uncle and the old man from the weapon shop were fellow disciples under the same craftsman when they were younger.<br/>
"Even if I say that‚Ä¶.I dropped out in the middle. There were a lot of troubles at home and we had to raise Imia and the other children." (imia‚Äôs uncle)<br/>
"The management was completely screwed up back then." (oyaji)<br/>
"Despite being craftsmen?" (naofumi)<br/>
It was a somewhat ridiculous story.<br/>
"Whenever there was a huge discussion, it‚Äôd be about women. My master was obsessed with love." (imia‚Äôs uncle)<br/>
It seems like the master was similar to Motoyasu. In my head, the old man‚Äôs master turned into Motoyasu.<br/>
Although, the Motoyasu I know has already turned into a Firo maniac.<br/>
What kind of life did Imia‚Äôs uncle go through? Imia also became a slave, I really don‚Äôt know any details.<br/>
A wave similar to Raphtalia‚Äôs‚Ä¶..was considered strange. Since it was huge.<br/>
"Speaking of which, how did you and Imia become slaves?" (naofumi)<br/>
"We were forced into slavery after being caught by slave hunters. During that time, quite a lot of corpses appeared and the village was also ruined. The only survivors are the ones with the Hero of the Shield-sama." (imia‚Äôs uncle)<br/>
I see, there was also that kind of pattern. Raphtalia also experienced something similar.<br/>
"The orphaned Imia seems so happy now. I feel that I also want to lend my strength to the Hero of the Shield-sama" (imia‚Äôs uncle)<br/>
The circumstances behind the slavery were things such as being sold by parents, having no relatives or slave hunting.<br/>
Sadina‚Äôs reason was the same, being caught by slave hunters.<br/>
Then what about Fohl‚Äã?<br/>
"What about you?" (naofumi)<br/>
"I couldn‚Äôt pay for Atla‚Äôs medical fees and we were also burdened with debt." (fohl)<br/>
"‚Ä¶‚Ä¶so it seems I‚Äôll receive a bill." (naofumi)<br/>
Should I sell him depending on the amount of money?<br/>
No, there‚Äôs also the medicine costs. This guy owes me quite a debt.<br/>
"As far as I know, it disappeared when we were presented to you." (fohl)<br/>
"I see, that‚Äôs good." (naofumi)<br/>
Those slave dealers. So that part was given as a service.<br/>
"Originally I worked and fought‚Ä¶..the debt was gone, otherwise I wouldn‚Äôt have been able to buy medicine." (fohl)<br/>
"I see‚Ä¶." (naofumi)<br/>
"Atla should‚Äôve been able to have a more normal life. At the very least, she shouldn‚Äôt have had to suffer from her illness." (fohl)<br/>
"What kind of background did you have?" (naofumi)<br/>
"Who knows‚Ä¶.? I only know that grandfather was amazing. My parents were lost in the war when we were young, but I think they were also pretty influential. There were a lot of people who helped around." (fohl)<br/>
"What about servants to put on your clothes?" (naofumi)<br/>
"We didn‚Äôt have those kinds of guys. But since we couldn‚Äôt pay, our household belongings were distributed and we parted." (fohl)<br/>
Ruined by medical fees, huh‚Ä¶‚Ä¶<br/>
To have loyal subordinates and stuff, what kind of noble were you?<br/>
"Where did you live?" (naofumi)<br/>
"Why do I have to tell you that much?" (fohl)<br/>
"Well, that‚Äôs true." (naofumi)<br/>
Worrying about the background of this hero-ish guy, my mind was dwelling on something inconsequential.<br/>
"Well since you‚Äôre already acquainted, it simplifies things." (naofumi)<br/>
"Well, that‚Äôs true but‚Ä¶..I never thought the smithing place I would be employed at would be yours." (imia‚Äôs uncle)<br/>
"I was also surprised. I‚Äôm taking in an apprentice due to Laddie‚Äôs request but, well, you‚Äôre a fine partner so isn‚Äôt it good." (oyaji)<br/>
"How nostalgic. It brings back the past." (imia‚Äôs uncle)<br/>
"Including lodging fees, how much should I pay?" (naofumi)<br/>
"It includes boarding, right? If I can work him hard then I don‚Äôt need it." (oyaji)<br/>
"I‚Äôm grateful for your generosity." (naofumi)<br/>
"Hey‚Ä¶.stop saying stuff like working me to death." (imia‚Äôs uncle)<br/>
He‚Äôs become sturdier than normal Demi-humans due to there being some correction.<br/>
Will the old man also be Spartan when teaching?<br/>
How should I say it, pipes or cigars would probably suit Imia‚Äôs uncle but he doesn‚Äôt smoke.<br/>
He wears overalls and looks like a hillbilly.<br/>
Well, whatever.<br/>
"I‚Äôll have you work to a similar standard as we did in the past." (oyaji)<br/>
"That would kill me." (imia‚Äôs uncle)<br/>
"Ha ha ha, it‚Äôs not as bad as you think." (oyaji)<br/>
And with that, they started work as the old man chatted with Imia‚Äôs uncle.<br/>
It looks like it will be fine if it‚Äôs like this.<br/>
"Well we‚Äôve got some errands to do." (naofumi)<br/>
"Alright, I‚Äôll beat the shop‚Äôs business into this guy." (oyaji)<br/>
"I want you to teach me how to beat the techniques into this guy, so won‚Äôt you come to my land?" (naofumi)<br/>
Depending on whether his skills rival the old man or if they‚Äôre just at the level of a salesperson, we‚Äôll be able to have weapons and armour made for the village.<br/>
"I haven‚Äôt really thought about it. For now, I have to see how capable he is." (oyaji)<br/>
"I haven‚Äôt done much. Only as far as continuing to do a bit of metal-work." (imia‚Äôs uncle)<br/>
"A modest attitude. I‚Äôll have you show me how well you swing your hammer." (oyaji)<br/>
"Look forward to it." (imia‚Äôs uncle)<br/>
It feels like a reunion between long-term friends. It‚Äôs not bad.<br/>
"Well then, I‚Äôll come again if anything happens. If you need me, just contact the village or the castle." (naofumi)<br/>
"I know, Laddie." (oyaji)<br/>
"I‚Äôll work hard to learn the work, Hero of the Shield-sama." (imia‚Äôs uncle)<br/>
And like this, we left the weapon store behind.<br/>
<br/>
