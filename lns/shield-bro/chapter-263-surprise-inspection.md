Chapter 263: Surprise Inspection.<br/>
Now then, today I’ve decided to perform a surprise inspection on the slaves’ and heroes’ dwellings.<br/>
The reason being to make sure they didn’t bring back something strange again.<br/>
Even though we can absorb things into my weapon, taking them out is difficult, so personal property must be kept safe.<br/>
Magic water and Spirit water are unexpectedly easy to compound, and quite a few useful items come out from monster drops.<br/>
But other drops and materials need to be kept apart, or we won’t be able to find them when they are needed.<br/>
I warned Ren and Motoyasu not to rely too much on their weapon’s automatic compounding abilities, so they should have some materials lying around.<br/>
And, I don’t want them to be monopolizing rare items.<br/>
Things like those will be confiscated.<br/>
For this inspection, I’ll be investigating behind everyone’s back.<br/>
"Naofumi-sama, what are you doing?" (Raphtalia)<br/>
I was in the middle of secretly breaking into the Camping Plant we erected for Ren.<br/>
I turn around to find Raphtalia looking at me with doubting eyes.<br/>
"I’m investigating whether Ren is hiding anything nice." (Naofumi)<br/>
"Hah… That is… I understand. Naofumi-sama is just this sort of person." (Raphtalia)<br/>
Though her expression indicates that she wants to give up, Raphtalia follows me.<br/>
She probably has something to say, but she holds it in.<br/>
I still get the feeling that I’m doing something wrong, so I guess I’m not completely devoid of human conscience yet.<br/>
There are people who praise me no matter what evil things I do, so I’m starting to lose track of myself.<br/>
Unlawful breaking and entering, as well as theft, are trademarks of Heroes.<br/>
Most of the Heroes I know of are habitual offenders.<br/>
But… that’s just in games.<br/>
The first room I check is Ren’s.<br/>
"Fumu… There isn’t really anything here." (Naofumi)<br/>
It’s a bare room with a desk and a bed. Imya’s Uncle also taught him some smithing, so there are some broken swords and ores scattered around.<br/>
On the desk is a notebook he seems to be using to practice writing.<br/>
It looks like he’s studying diligently.<br/>
Now that I think about it, it’s impossible for the current Ren to get ahold of Rare Items.<br/>
His curse decreased his luck, and he doesn’t get any EXP.<br/>
"Is this the Hero of the Sword’s room?" (Raphtalia)<br/>
"Yeah, Ren’s using this room." (Naofumi)<br/>
But he doesn’t come by this room often.<br/>
He usually goes around with Female Knight or Taniko.<br/>
It doesn’t seem like he has any hidden items, so I guess that’s it.<br/>
"It’s cleaner than I imagined. Is he studying Blacksmithing?" (Raphtalia)<br/>
"Yeah, I’ve left it to him. He seems to be diligently learning." (Naofumi)<br/>
Is this a copper sword? I guess he made it for practice.<br/>
Because he has no luck, its make isn’t the best.<br/>
The desk has a few diagrams for sword designs.<br/>
They’re like the ones I make for accessories.<br/>
Wondering if he had some black history involving Chuuni, I look through them.<br/>
But unfortunately, I don’t find any dirt.<br/>
In retaliation, I looked under the bed for porn, but again, nothing.<br/>
He’s no fun at all.<br/>
"Naofumi-sama, if you’ve lost interest, you don’t have to search." (Raphtalia)<br/>
"Was it showing on my face?" (Naofumi)<br/>
"Yes." (Raphtalia)<br/>
Fuu… Well, since I’m starting to act like a burglar, I better call it quits here.<br/>
Ren’s in the clear.<br/>
I’ll check the Heroes in order. So next is Motoyasu.<br/>
Motoyasu has a house built away from the village, next to the Filo Rial stable.<br/>
He lives there with his initial three.<br/>
By the way, it’s quite a big building.<br/>
I’m the designer.<br/>
Though it’s just a temporary Camping Plant-based house.<br/>
Currently, Motoyasu is transporting Witch, so he’s not in.<br/>
If I want to search, I won’t get a better time.<br/>
I can’t stand dealing with him after he went insane. Though, I couldn’t deal with him earlier either.<br/>
"Is this the Hero of the Spear’s house? He seemed quite different when I saw him at the castle." (Raphtalia)<br/>
"Yeah, he’ll call any woman a pig, and raising Filo Rials has become the meaning of his existence." (Naofumi)<br/>
"…" (Raphtalia)<br/>
I speak as I undo the house’s lock.<br/>
In this village, locks are meaningless before me.<br/>
"Naofumi-sama, I think you should learn about something called privacy." (Raphtalia)<br/>
"Those heroes don’t have the right to privacy." (Naofumi)<br/>
I mean, they are currently criminals.<br/>
I’m no demon. I won’t seize anything without reason.<br/>
If it’s just something like porn, I’ll leave it as is.<br/>
"Hah…" (Raphtalia)<br/>
Raphtalia’s sigh is quite heavy.<br/>
Anyways, I’m in Motoyasu’s house.<br/>
The entrance leads to a mixed living room and kitchen.<br/>
It’s much tidier than I thought it would be.<br/>
I remember Midori and the other two saying something about cleaning up the place.<br/>
Out of the three, I believe that Midori is the most reliable one on things like this.<br/>
Though the fact that the only male in the group is as such is strange in itself.<br/>
No, is Midori the one that’s weird? Given his gender, he still targets Motoyasu.<br/>
And from the shared living space, the house divides into four rooms.<br/>
Each room had something drawn over it: a red feather, a blue feather, a green feather, and finally a spear.<br/>
I guess each room is assigned individually.<br/>
Without any hesitation, I proceed to disengage the lock on the room with the spear.<br/>
For some reason, there are three sets of locks on it.<br/>
His security is making me curious.<br/>
Could it be that his behavior is an act, and he’s planning on framing me again?<br/>
The door opens.<br/>
Inside is an exceedingly ordinary room, though there are a few Filo Rial goods here and there.<br/>
It seems there’s no bed.<br/>
Motoyasu sleeps while cuddling with Filo Rials, so I guess a bed is unnecessary.<br/>
"This room somehow feels nice." (Raphtalia)<br/>
"Yes… but…" (Naofumi)<br/>
Something’s strange.<br/>
This room is much narrower than the one I designed in the house’s construction plan.<br/>
There must be some secret passage somewhere, but… finding it is a pain.<br/>
「Emergency Modification, Door Creation」<br/>
I instruct the Camping Plant to create a door.<br/>
With a creaking sound, a door is made.<br/>
"… There is no privacy before Naofumi-sama, is there?" (Raphtalia)<br/>
"Yes, inside of a Camping Plant house, there is none." (Naofumi)<br/>
Otherwise, there’s no way I could let Ren and Motoyasu live so freely.<br/>
I think as I open the door.<br/>
"This is-" (Naofumi)<br/>
I close the door.<br/>
"Naofumi-sama?" (Raphtalia)<br/>
I put my hand on my eyebrows and think.<br/>
‘There are some things in this world better left unknown.’<br/>
Is what I really thought.<br/>
"What’s wrong?" (Raphtalia)<br/>
I silently beckon Raphtalia to open the door.<br/>
Understanding the situation, Raphtalia takes a deep breath and opens it.<br/>
"Wha…" (Raphtalia)<br/>
Raphtalia is at a loss for words.<br/>
Right, as expected, Motoyasu’s hidden room… was colored with Firo.<br/>
In the literal sense.<br/>
The walls were covered with hand-drawn pictures of Firo, and they even extended up to the ceiling.<br/>
On a desk is a large stack of notebooks.<br/>
Scattered around them are drawings of bird form and human form, all forms of Firo.<br/>
He’s actually quite good…<br/>
That guy’s got a nice face, he’s a Hero, he can cook, and he can draw.<br/>
If he did something about that personality, he’d be ridiculously popular.<br/>
No, he really was quite popular.<br/>
But, Motoyasu’s love life doesn’t really matter to me.<br/>
I turn off my useless thoughts and look over the room once more.<br/>
Every corner of the room is sprinkled with Filo Rial feathers, and the bed… no that’s a life-sized Firo stuffed doll (Filo Rial form) that has a life-sized Firo stuffed doll (Human Form) on top.<br/>
Using these two, could he…<br/>
(ED: OMG I’ve been looking all over for those! ME WANT)<br/>
No, thinking about it is dangerous. I don’t need to look into it that deeply.<br/>
The doll’s stuffing seems to be Firo’s molted feathers.<br/>
Uu… The whole room smells of Filo Rial.<br/>
"W-what is this!?" (Raphtalia)<br/>
Raphtalia takes in a deep breath and shouts out with a pale face.<br/>
I’m of the same opinion.<br/>
"It’s the room of Firo’s stalker. No, perhaps the room of a Yandere." (Naofumi)<br/>
Why has the Yandere hater become the Yandere?<br/>
I try opening one of the books.<br/>
For some reason, I hear a high pitched squeal from behind me.<br/>
Inside, sketches of Firo were closely packed together.<br/>
And I open another book… It seems to be an Ero Doujin based on Firo.<br/>
Why does he even have one for her bird form? What’s more, his skill is amazing.<br/>
The male character in these is Motoyasu? No, there are tentacle ones as well…<br/>
"Isn’t Firo in grave danger?" (Raphtalia)<br/>
"That Firo? Motoyasu shows absolute obedience to Firo. He’s under the illusion that she’ll fall for him someday." (Naofumi)<br/>
"B-but even that man’s a Hero. He may force Firo to do things like this." (Raphtalia)<br/>
"I don’t think that’s happening." (Naofumi)<br/>
Even if he tries to force himself on Firo, Firo can fend for herself.<br/>
He doesn’t lay hands on those three, so I don’t think he’ll be breaking soon. I hope.<br/>
"And if I try to confiscate any of the items here, I fear for the future." (Naofumi)<br/>
"… Right." (Raphtalia)<br/>
This is most likely where Motoyasu keeps all of his pent up desires.<br/>
If I try to suppress them, he may explode.<br/>
Right now, keeping the status quo seems to be best.<br/>
Anyways, I didn’t have to see this.<br/>
Motoyasu’s madness is endless.<br/>
… For now, let me just go check the other three rooms.<br/>
The result: Pets tend to resemble their masters.<br/>
If Motoyasu goes on a rampage, those three will probably resolve it.<br/>
"Next is Itsuki." (Naofumi)<br/>
"Umm… Can’t we stop at this?" (Raphtalia)<br/>
"If I leave his unchecked, he may do something troubling." (Naofumi)<br/>
I won’t let you say you forgot Motoyasu’s room.<br/>
To see what they’re planning and to make countermeasures is vital.<br/>
"But, you left the Hero of the Bow to Rishia-san, did you not?" (Raphtalia)<br/>
"Yeah, but it would be no joke if he brought Rishia over to his side." (Naofumi)<br/>
"Hah…" (Raphtalia)<br/>
But Itsuki hasn’t been here long,so he probably doesn’t have much there.<br/>
Rishia is constantly watching him, so he won’t do anything strange.<br/>
Today, he left with Rishia to assist in leveling the slaves.<br/>
Since he’s been cursed to be a Yes Man, he won’t run anytime soon.<br/>
And so, we proceed to Itsuki and Rishia’s house.<br/>
For Rishia, is it her nest of love?<br/>
I told her not do anything immoral, so it’ll probably be fine.<br/>
"Fumu… it’s all clear." (Naofumi)<br/>
"Yeah. And isn’t this Rishia-san’s house? I don’t think you’ll find anything." (Raphtalia)<br/>
Well, Rishia’s been here since the village started.<br/>
Her personality seems to be quite loyal, that girl.<br/>
The place seems to be cleaned regularily.<br/>
The rooms are decorated with weapons and armor, and it gives off the impression of an adventurer’s house.<br/>
Inside of the bedroom is a single large bed.<br/>
Do they sleep together?<br/>
It is an ordinary house without anything out of place.<br/>
I wonder what fun things Itsuki will say about living here after his curse clears.<br/>
"Naofumi-sama? Are you thinking something strange again?" (Raphtalia)<br/>
Imagining Itsuki getting hooked on gambling and slowly whittling down Rishia’s savings, leading to the collapse of the family, puts my mind slightly at ease.<br/>
After all, Itsuki abandoned Rishia, ran off to commit a crime, and came back after we beat him up.<br/>
"Naofumi-sama! Get a hold of yourself!" (Raphtalia)<br/>
"… What?" (Naofumi)<br/>
I’m just indulging myself in some pleasant fantasies, but Raphtalia scolds me.<br/>
I mean, Itsuki isn’t repenting at all, and he can’t think at all right now.<br/>
Though I admit from my imagination, that I am garbage.<br/>
