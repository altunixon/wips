<br/>
"Spirit User, give me your blood." <br/>
The Great Sage-sama said to me while showing a peek of her sharp fangs.<br/>
Wait a moment! <br/>
"Wait!" (Lucy)<br/>
Looks like Lucy has successfully restarted.<br/>
She pries me off the Great Sage-sama.<br/>
"What do you mean by giving you blood?!" (Lucy)<br/>
"Were you not listening? I am a vampire. Isn’t it obvious that I drink blood?" <br/>
"If you do that, Makoto will become a vampire!" (Lucy)<br/>
Ah, so it really does work that way?<br/>
If you get your blood sucked, that human becomes a vampire.<br/>
It is the same in other worlds, huh.<br/>
"Don’t worry. I don’t plan on turning the Hero of another country into a vampire. I will hold back." <br/>
The Great Sage-sama says as if it is a pain as she seizes my collar and pulls me.<br/>
Uoh, strong!<br/>
Her white skin and big red eyes draw real close.<br/>
"Then, thanks for the meal." <br/>
"P-Please don’t make it hurt…" (Makoto)<br/>
There was no response to my request.<br/>
She grins.<br/>
The Great Sage-sama opens her mouth wide with an ‘aan’.<br/>
Her small and cold lips touched my neck and a prickling pain followed.<br/>
"Kuh…!" (Makoto)<br/>
It hurts…less than I expected.<br/>
"M-Makoto…" (Lucy)<br/>
Lucy watches over in suspense, so I direct a smile at her to ease her worries.<br/>
The gulping sounds of the Great Sage-sama’s throat rang in my ears.<br/>
Uwah…my blood is being drunk here, isn’t it?<br/>
"U-Uhm…anymore than that…or maybe, please drink my blood!" (Lucy)<br/>
Lucy must have gotten worried, she proposed to take my place.<br/>
"…It is okay…Lucy…" (Makoto)<br/>
I don’t want to make her take my place.<br/>
The Great Sage-sama separates her mouth.<br/>
"[High Heal]." <br/>
The wound in my neck heals in an instant.<br/>
The pain disappeared.<br/>
So she uses healing magic after drinking blood.<br/>
"Fuuh, that was tasty." <br/>
The Great Sage-sama licks her lips with her cheeks slightly flushed as if satisfied.<br/>
Her small tongue licked away the little bit of blood that was hanging on her lip.<br/>
…It is kinda erotic.<br/>
"Was it to your liking?" (Makoto)<br/>
If she says it tastes bad, I’m getting angry, okay?<br/>
"Undirty blood really is great. Especially the otherworlders. They eat good stuff, so their taste is even better." <br/>
"Is that how it works?" (Makoto)<br/>
I was eating a whole lot of hamburgers, fried potatoes, and other types of junk food all the time in my previous world though.<br/>
I had a pretty unhealthy diet.<br/>
Yet she seems to like my blood.<br/>
"…Undirty blood…" (Lucy)<br/>
The expression of Lucy darkens at the words of the Great Sage-sama.<br/>
"What’s the matter, Lucy?" (Makoto)<br/>
"As expected, it won’t work with me, huh… I can’t take the place of Makoto…" (Lucy)<br/>
What is it?<br/>
Was the word undirty blood something that bothered her?<br/>
"Oi, red haired mage. You are having a misunderstanding there." <br/>
The Great Sage-sama seems to know what she means.<br/>
"…My demon blood is dirty, right?" (Lucy)<br/>
"No. You certainly do have demon blood mixed in and there’s people who call the demonkin as dirty blood, but mine had a different meaning. In the first place, I am also a demon, you know?" <br/>
So there’s that kind of meaning.<br/>
The demonkin is dirty blood.<br/>
That sounds racist…<br/>
"Then, what does ‘undirty blood’ mean?" (Lucy)<br/>
The Great Sage-sama averted her eyes at the question of Lucy as if finding it hard to answer.<br/>
Even though she is the type of person that says things straight, this is quite the strange reaction.<br/>
"Great Sage-sama?" "Please tell us." <br/>
The Great Sage-sama goes ‘fumu’ and speaks.<br/>
"Undirty Blood means…that. It means the blood of someone who doesn’t have sexual experience." <br/>
"Eh?" "Huh?" <br/>
"Spirit User-kun, you are a virgin, right?" <br/>
What?!<br/>
"I-I-I’m not a virgin!" (Makoto)<br/>
I ended up saying that reflexively. <br/>
"Eh?! You are not?" (Lucy)<br/>
Lucy-san, please don’t retort to that.<br/>
It is a lie. I am.<br/>
"Hmm, but my Superior Rank Appraisal Skill is showing [Status: Virgin] though." <br/>
"You can see that with a Skill?!" (Makoto)<br/>
Don’t joke around, Appraisal Skill! <br/>
Is there no privacy?<br/>
I am suing! <br/>
"T-The Appraisal Skill can even tell that?" (Lucy)<br/>
Lucy hugs her own body and retreats.<br/>
"With Appraisal at Monarch Rank, you can apparently tell the amount of people too. I wouldn’t want to know though." <br/>
""Scary!"" <br/>
That’s scary.<br/>
The Appraisal Skill looks all docile, but it is actually a degenerate Skill…<br/>
…Fuji-yan’s Appraisal Skill is Superior Rank, right?<br/>
I hope his Skill won’t grow and turn into Monarch Rank.<br/>
No, mine is zero so it won’t affect me though!<br/>
"Uhm, so that means Makoto is a virgin, so his blood is tasty?" (Lucy)<br/>
Lucy-san, there’s no need to confirm every single time.<br/>
"Yeah, lifeblood tastes the best when it is a human and virgin!" <br/>
The Great Sage-sama answers with a nice smile.<br/>
Lucy averted her face and her shoulders were shaking.<br/>
…Oi, you are laughing, right?<br/>
"With this, your debt of having to deal with your Spirit Magic is paid… Fufu, if you offer me your blood from now on, I will lend you my help anytime." <br/>
"Eeh~, that’s a bit…" (Makoto)<br/>
I don’t really want that.<br/>
"What do you usually do for food?" (Lucy)<br/>
Lucy asks.<br/>
Yeah, how does she manage?<br/>
"As I said, me being a vampire is a state secret that only few know about. My food is blood used for medical care that’s brought to me. It is tasteless though… Lifeblood drunk directly really is the best." <br/>
Please don’t look over here while licking your lips.<br/>
"It doesn’t have to be me." (Makoto)<br/>
"Hmph! Every single one of them copulates like animals. The taste of the Light Hero’s blood was the worst. A man of your age who is still a virgin is pretty rare. I don’t go for the blood of children after all." <br/>
"…"<br/>
Looks like being a virgin is rare.<br/>
I’m not happy about that.<br/>
…What’s this? <br/>
Bullying? Sexual harassment?<br/>
"Sakurai-kun…isn’t lacking in women after all." (Makoto)<br/>
"Makoto, cheer up. You are okay too, you know." (Lucy)<br/>
"Oi, Lucy, look here when saying that." (Makoto)<br/>
Her eyes were laughing.<br/>
"What are you talking about others, virgin mage?" <br/>
"Wa?!" (Lucy)<br/>
Aah, Lucy-san. <br/>
Even though you don’t have experience either, you were riding on your high horse and got toppled down for double the damage.<br/>
"Then, I will be leaving now." (Makoto)<br/>
I feel kinda anemic.<br/>
I am tired for a variety of reasons.<br/>
"Umu, if you are troubled with something, come by again." <br/>
The Great Sage-sama was in a whole lot better mood than the time when I came.<br/>
"Aah, by the way, I ended up defeating the Hero of the Valentine Household, so I might be on their sights." (Makoto)<br/>
"About that, huh. Who do you think I am? I have been the Great Sage since the founding of Highland. If they say anything, I will roar them away." <br/>
Ooh, that’s reliable.<br/>
Princess Noel and the Great Sage-sama; with both of them as allies, it should be okay.<br/>
"In exchange…you know, right?" <br/>
The Great Sage-sama says with a grin.<br/>
Pay with my blood, right?<br/>
Well, I should just think about it as a blood donation.<br/>
"Aah, right. If possible, stay a virgin so your blood doesn’t get dirty." <br/>
"Please don’t be unreasonable." (Makoto)<br/>
I won’t obey that order even if it is you, Great Sage-sama!<br/>
"What. Are you planning on losing your v-card? What a shame. Your blood will taste worse." <br/>
"Eh?! Makoto, who is it?! Aya? Princess Sofia?" (Lucy)<br/>
"I don’t have any such plans." (Makoto)<br/>
Are you an idiot?<br/>
Moreover, the latter is impossible.<br/>
"Then, thanks a lot for all you did." (Makoto)<br/>
"U-Uhm, I want to know more about my great grandfather, so if possible, can I hear about him, Great Sage-sama?" (Lucy)<br/>
"Hm, well, I don’t mind." <br/>
It seems Lucy will be staying here.<br/>
"Lucy, you are gonna get your blood sucked." (Makoto)<br/>
"Idiot. It is not like anyone’s fine. I am a former human. The blood of an elf or a demon doesn’t suit my body." <br/>
"There’s something like that too, huh." (Makoto)<br/>
There’s a lot going with vampires too, huh.<br/>
I left the residence of the Great Sage-sama.<br/>
◇◇<br/>
I lost blood and was tired, so I returned to my own room in the inn and got some sleep for a while.<br/>
At the time for dinner, I staggered my way to the diner.<br/>
The one there was Fuji-yan, and he jumped at me the moment he saw me.<br/>
"Takki-dono! I heard! You left the Lightning Hero, Geralt-sama, half-dead!" (Fuji)<br/>
Aren’t you getting information way too fast?<br/>
The information network of a merchant is crazy.<br/>
Is there twitter here?<br/>
"Rather than calling it half-dead…" (Aya)<br/>
"He was practically dead…" (Lucy)<br/>
The ones retorting were Sa-san and Lucy.<br/>
The two have returned from the Highland Castle, huh.<br/>
Ah, it was just that the two of them told him about the matter of Geralt-san, huh. <br/>
"M-Makoto-sama, to think you would defeat the Lightning Hero-sama who is the Ranking 3…" (Chris)<br/>
Chris-san trembles.<br/>
"As I thought, I knew Takatsuki-sama wasn’t your average person!" (Nina)<br/>
Nina-san praises me as usual.<br/>
"Chris-san, what’s this about rankings?" (Aya)<br/>
Sa-san asks about a word that I was also interested about.<br/>
"Once a year, the royal families of the six countries as well as representative nobles gather. At that time, the strong fighters of each country do matches in their presence." (Chris)<br/>
"The placings there are called Rankings!" (Nina)<br/>
Nina-san adds to the explanation of Chris-san.<br/>
"I see. By the way, who is number 1?" (Makoto)<br/>
I can imagine who it is though.<br/>
"Of course, the reincarnation of the Savior Abel, the Light Hero, Sakurai-sama!" (Nina)<br/>
Nina-san says with a smile as she looks to where Sakurai-kun is.<br/>
Yeah, it has been bothering me for a while now.<br/>
…Why is Sakurai-kun here?<br/>
"Fujiwara-kun called me here. Asking me if I wanted to have dinner together. I too wanted to have a leisure talk with everyone, you see." (Sakurai)<br/>
Sakurai-kun says with a refreshing smile.<br/>
At his back there’s the beauty, Yokoyama-san.<br/>
Our eyes met, and she smiled.<br/>
Even though in class we wouldn’t even make eye-contact.<br/>
Or more like, I averted my gaze.<br/>
Isn’t the quality of the 1-A class high?<br/>
"Well then, everyone! Let’s have dinner. The preparations are ready-desu zo." (Fuji)<br/>
We moved to a table where extravagant dishes were lined up.<br/>
◇◇<br/>
"The food of Highland is flashy." (Makoto)<br/>
A combination plate of expensive-looking cheese and hors d’oeuvre. <br/>
Salad and terrine using vegetables in season.<br/>
Mushrooms of nice scent elegantly added to the soup.<br/>
Gratin of a big lobster that looks like spiny lobster. <br/>
A variety of steaks and vibrant sauces.<br/>
And a whole lot of fruits and desserts.<br/>
"It is like french food." (Aya)<br/>
"Yeah, but the calories are high. Because of that, I have to be careful to not get fat." <br/>
"Aah, that is indeed troubling." (Aya)<br/>
"Right~?" <br/>
Sa-san and Yokoyama-san were having a highschool girl conversation.<br/>
"Fuji-yan, what were you doing today?" (Makoto)<br/>
"I was going around greeting the companies that have helped me out. I was thinking about going around the city of Symphonia. Want to go together?" (Fuji)<br/>
"That sounds nice. I will." (Makoto)<br/>
Exploring the capital.<br/>
The biggest capital of this continent.<br/>
I am looking forward to it.<br/>
"At any rate, Takki-dono, you went crazy again." (Fuji)<br/>
"Really. To think you would fight that Geralt-sama who is said to be a mad wolf." (Chris)<br/>
Fuji-yan and Chris-san said this with an amazed expression.<br/>
"He came at us, so I had no choice." (Makoto)<br/>
I am not the one in the wrong.<br/>
"But Takatsuki-kun, it was a relief that Sakurai-kun was there, wasn’t it?" (Aya)<br/>
"Really, I was wondering for a moment what would happen." (Lucy)<br/>
Looks like Sa-san could see that Geralt-san was in a bad situation due to my magic.<br/>
Lucy felt that the mana of the Spirits was going out of control, huh.<br/>
The two of them couldn’t find a way to stop me though.<br/>
And so, at that moment, Sakurai-kun was the one who stopped me.<br/>
"Sakurai-kun, you really helped me out there." (Makoto)<br/>
"Haha, of course I would help you Takatsuki-kun." (Sakurai)<br/>
That’s the Light Hero-sama.<br/>
His face and heart are gold.<br/>
"Ryosuke and Takatsuki-kun are actually good friends, huh." <br/>
Yokoyama-san said as if she suddenly realized.<br/>
It is not really like we got along especially well though.<br/>
It is true that we have had more chances to speak to each other lately though.<br/>
"I have been friends with Takatsuki-kun since elementary school." (Sakurai)<br/>
Sakurai-kun says straight.<br/>
…No, we weren’t friends, right?<br/>
We practically didn’t speak to each other in middle school or highschool. <br/>
"Eeeeeh?!" "What?!" "Really?!" <br/>
Sa-san, Fuji-yan, and Yokoyama-san; my classmates raised their voices in surprise.<br/>
"Takki-dono, I didn’t hear anything about this!" (Fuji)<br/>
"I have never seen you speaking to each other in middle school." (Aya)<br/>
"…Isn’t that fine?" (Makoto)<br/>
It is not like everyone stays friends just because you are together in elementary school.<br/>
When you are in higher grades of middle school, there is a tall wall called the high and low caste. <br/>
The center of the class that is Sakurai-kun, and me who played games at the corner of the class.<br/>
"Takatsuki-kun lived at the house next door. We played together pretty often when we were kids." (Sakurai)<br/>
"Makoto, you were childhood friends with the Light Hero-sama?!" (Lucy)<br/>
Lucy shouts in surprise.<br/>
"Sakurai-kun, it was simply that the apartment complex that I was living in was by the side of yours. That’s not called a house next door." (Makoto)<br/>
"But we would go to school together in our first year of elementary." (Sakurai)<br/>
Well, that’s true. <br/>
I am surprised you remember.<br/>
"Hey hey, how was Takatsuki-kun in his grade schooler days?" (Aya)<br/>
Sa-san asks Sakurai-kun with great interest.<br/>
There’s nothing really interesting about it though.<br/>
"Ah! Then, I will talk about the time when Takatsuki-kun saved us." (Sakurai)<br/>
Sakurai-kun responds with a smile.<br/>
Eh? What story is that?<br/>
