						<p>It was in the Jewel, the round table room.</p>
<p>The ancestors were troubling Lyle, raining him with their usual jeers.</p>
<p>『That’s why you’re no good!』<br />
『I’ll have to agree. Why did you run away there?』<br />
『I really wonder what that makes you as a man.』<br />
『The worst. You’ve crossed zero into the negatives. The negatives!』<br />
『Just sleep with her already. That’ll be the end of it.』<br />
『Lyle, you need to understand a woman’s heart better.』<br />
『Sixth, please repeat those words in front of a mirror. But Lyle, that really was pitiful.』</p>
<p>It all started in an inn in Dalien, where Lyle had managed to make a good atmosphere with Novem.</p>
<p>But Lyle himself failed to notice so, and fed up as she was, Novem dealt with him with a smile.</p>
<p>The problem was, having witnessed that, the ancestors dragged Lyle into the Jewel to find fault with him.</p>
<p>Lyle was made to kneel on the floor as he hung his head.</p>
<p>“But there’s no way I could understand that sort of atmosphere, or rather…”</p>
<p>The Fourth pushed up his glasses, letting the lenses eerily catch the light as he let out a low voice.</p>
<p>『An excuse eh… this is worse than I thought.』</p>
<p>Ever fussy when it came to the treatment of women, the Fourth had been dissatisfied with Lyle’s attitude towards Novem for a long time now.</p>
<p>『Listen well, Lyle! When things were going so rosy between you, not doing anything at all is a discourtesy to the woman.』</p>
<p>His socialization skills disastrous from the start, Lyle impatiently put up resistance against the Fourth.</p>
<p>“No, um… Novem’s face was definitely a little red, and her smile was a different one than usual, but… I didn’t really get what to do next or rather, in a situation where you’re all watching me, I’m not really sure what I’m supposed to do.”</p>
<p>The excuse Lyle gave was that he was unable to do anything in a situation where he was under constant surveillance from the ancestors in the Jewel.</p>
<p>But that was something the others agreed with as well.</p>
<p>The Fifth gave a light nod.</p>
<p>『Well, that’s definitely a problem. 』</p>
<p>The other ancestors held a similar opinion.</p>
<p>The Fifth…</p>
<p>『Sure enough, I’d be troubled to respond if you suddenly embraced her. Well, if we just make it so we can’t interfere at those times alone…』</p>
<p>As everyone began to say something like that, Lyle found it in himself to question it a bit.</p>
<p>(They’re all just booing me, but generally speaking, what should I have done?)</p>
<p>That’s why he asked.</p>
<p>“Umm…”</p>
<p>The First irritably looked at Lyle.</p>
<p>『What is it?』</p>
<p>“I still don’t get what I should have done. How would all of you have handled umm—‘What would you do when your wife shows you a different smile than usual’?”</p>
<p>The ancestors were more flustered than Lyle expected. They all tried imagining a scene where their wife would show them a different smile than usual.</p>
<p>… It happened.</p>
<p>Right after, Lyle sensed the large jewel embedded in the center of the round table let off a faint light.</p>
<p>(What is this? Did something just glow? Huh? Did the others see…)</p>
<p>Noticing something strange was going on, Lyle looked at his ancestors.</p>
<p>The First had broken into a clearly strange sweat as he held his head.</p>
<p>It was almost as if everyone was seeing an illusion of their wife before their eyes.</p>
<p>『T-that ain’t it, dear. So you don’t have to approach me with that smile. I’m begging you, forgive meeeeeeee!!』</p>
<p>The Second shook his head as he prepared to flee. While he usually dressed himself in a relatively taciturn air, he was now desperately calling out to his unseen wife.</p>
<p>『Just give me a moment. Yeah, could you give me just a bit of time to think? D-don’t come any closeeer!!』</p>
<p>The Third was smiling as per usual, but he was shedding a cold sweat.</p>
<p>With both his hands, he gestured for the other party to wait as he spoke.</p>
<p>『I got it, let’s talk things out. So for now, how about you stop spinning around the iron ball? Let’s start by clearing up our misunderstandings.』</p>
<p>(Iron ball!? Eh? He’s talking to his wife, right?)</p>
<p>Lyle looked at the cowering figures of his firm ancestors as he thought of just what sort of people his ancestors’ wives could be.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, the Fourth slipped under the round table, his body hunched over and quivering.</p>
<p>For a while, now, he was only repeating the same words.</p>
<p>『I’m sorry. I’m sorry. I’m sor&#8211;』</p>
<p>The fifth alone wasn’t sweating. But with a straight face…</p>
<p>『… What are you planning?』</p>
<p>In a situation with his wife showing a different smile than usual, he could only hold doubt. Perhaps he wondered what lay beneath that smile, as he seemed deep in thought to probe it out.</p>
<p>(… What happened to everyone? Could it be they really are seeing illusions?)</p>
<p>They were in the Jewel. A space where it wouldn’t be strange if anything happened.</p>
<p>As he thought that, Lyle searched out the Sixth.</p>
<p>“Huh? The Sixth is gone?”</p>
<p>… The Sixth had fled long ago.</p>
<p>The Seventh was making a pale face, his back was straight, but he seemed somewhat fidgety.</p>
<p>『Zenoir, hear me out. You don’t have to approach me with that smile. Stop. You have to stop! I get it. It’s about that, right? About when I told Maizel that embarrassing story about you? Eh? That’s not it? That’s extra? Alright, first let’s take some distance from one another so we can discuss this. S-stop! Don’t point the gunpoint this way!』</p>
<p>(Gunpoint… grandmother was surprisingly extreme.)</p>
<p>Zenoir was Lyle’s grandmother. But Lyle only had the impression of her as a kind grandmother.</p>
<p>Perhaps seeing illusions, the ancestors tormented by their wives.</p>
<p>Lyle calmly looked at them and thought.</p>
<p>“… I wonder what sort of people the ancestors’ wives were.”</p>
