<br/>
I’m sorry Kookie, I already had it done when I checked the comments.<br/>
Once Mamafumi, always Mamafumi, oh and 20 chapters left.<br/>
Chapter 358: Returning Home<br/>
Now then, let me offer a bit of explanation about my house.<br/>
To put it bluntly, it’s a detached house that lies in a relatively quiet neighborhood near the city.<br/>
It has a yard, attached, and my parents bought it on a loan.<br/>
I slide the key into the door, and timidly look around as I enter.<br/>
"N-Naofumi-sa… n. What’s wrong?" (Raphtalia)<br/>
It seems there’s some resistance to her calling me –san as she asks me a question out of pure curiosity.<br/>
"Ah, no, if we ran into my parents here, it would pave the way to a mountain of misunderstandings." (Naofumi)<br/>
"Naofumi-sa… n’s Father and Mother?" (Raphtalia)<br/>
Raphtalia puts her hand over her heart, and takes a deep breath.<br/>
"Ah, it seems you don’t have to worry. My mom’s out at the moment." (Naofumi)<br/>
After confirming no one was home, I opened the house door, and invited Raphtalia in.<br/>
"So this is Naofumi-sa, n’s House?" (Raphtalia)<br/>
"Yeah." (Naofumi)<br/>
I thought I would bring her here once the world was at peace, but I never thought we would end up here like this.<br/>
I guess that just goes to show you never know what’s going to happen in life.<br/>
"Make sure to take off your shoes before coming in." (Naofumi)<br/>
"Understood." (Raphtalia)<br/>
As told, Raphtalia takes her shoes off before entering the house.<br/>
Now then, my room is on the second floor. To organize the information on hand, it’s best we go there, but… Here, I noticed something.<br/>
I’m an Otaku. An Otaku who invited a girl into his home, and is ready to show her his room.<br/>
The stereotypical development that comes with this situation is…<br/>
… Isn’t this bad? I have quite a few embarrassing things displayed there.<br/>
"Raphtalia, please wait here." (Naofumi)<br/>
I stop Raphtalia, and lead her to the living room.<br/>
"Is something the matter?" (Raphtalia)<br/>
… Right now, I’m stuck between two big life choices.<br/>
I could take Raphtalia to my room now, without care for my hobbies.<br/>
But the Galge posters, the figures and the various character goods are out in the open.<br/>
It’s not like I plan to hide the fact that I’m an Otaku at this point. I’m actually curious to see what Raphtalia will think of it.<br/>
But in that world, I continued to proclaim that love was useless and unnecessary.<br/>
If a guy like that’s room was filled with books of women, and figures, just what would she think?<br/>
Is it not right to stop her for now?<br/>
Okay! First of all, let’s clean the room!<br/>
"Please wait a second." (Naofumi)<br/>
"Ah, sure." (Raphtalia)<br/>
Raphtalia sat down on the living room sofa as I quickly ran up the steps to my room.<br/>
And what I found was my nostalgic castle.<br/>
Just how many times have I dreamed of returning here?<br/>
But that isn’t important right now.<br/>
Right now, Raphtalia’s going to come here.<br/>
How about I just openly display this embarrassing side of me?<br/>
I’ll stop that with all my might!<br/>
I stuff all the figures and Galge packages into the closet, and peel off the posters.<br/>
Oh? I had left my PC on the whole time, and Net Game Item I’ve put on the market has been sold.<br/>
… I’ll close it for now.<br/>
Next is—<br/>
"I’m home~."<br/>
Geh! My brother has returned.<br/>
That goddam Riajuu, why must he return at a time like this?<br/>
(TL: Riajuu can be translated to something like Realer, the people of the world beyond, 3DPD… etc, but I’ll stick with Riajuu here)<br/>
If that little brother of mine comes into contact with Raphtalia, it’s going to get complicated!<br/>
I quickly leave the room, and run down the stairs.<br/>
"What’s up, Nii-san?"<br/>
He had taken off his shoes in the entrance, and put his hand on the living room door when I called out to him.<br/>
"Wait, wait. Why don’t we have a little chat?" (Naofumi)<br/>
"Did something happen? The look in your eyes are a bit strange…?"<br/>
Is my face really that weird?<br/>
"More importantly, Niisan. Can’t you make some food?"<br/>
"Why?"<br/>
"What do you mean? Mom doesn’t seem to be home, so I thought I would ask you. I mean, I’m busy with my studies."<br/>
"Just go to the convenience store. I’ll give you some money." (Naofumi)<br/>
"Eh…. Nii-san’s food is much better than the ones at the store."<br/>
This is strange. Did my brother really like my home-made food that much?<br/>
No, well, I’ve always helped my parents out with the house chores, and I did it willingly to give off a good impression to them.<br/>
I’ve cooked for him whenever our parents weren’t home.<br/>
But even so, did he ever say anything so Kiel-like?<br/>
Is this déjà vu?<br/>
"Didn’t I ask you this morning? You totally said yes back then."<br/>
Come to think of it… I get the feeling I made some sort of promise like that.<br/>
I mean, to me, it’s been more than half a year, so there’s no way I really remember it.<br/>
"And Nii-san, you know, if you ever have trouble getting a job when ya graduate, you should try cooking school. Don’t go off wasting your talent like that, dude."<br/>
Mu… this one, I do have a recollection of.<br/>
I remember. Whenever something happens, my brother is someone who asks me to go cook.<br/>
Unlike me, he doesn’t really enjoy eating out.<br/>
Something about nutrition, and sodium, it’s like he’s a girl going through puberty.<br/>
"Anyways, today I have something to do. So go buy it at the convenience store." (Naofumi)<br/>
"Is it a promise with your Net Game friends again? How about you just stop playing around with those guys, and start taking stuff seriously, man?"<br/>
And as he said that, he opened and walked through the living room door.<br/>
"W-wait." (Naofumi)<br/>
"—I mean, you have someone like Raphtalia-san with ya, right?"<br/>
What…?<br/>
My mind can’t keep up with what my brother’s saying.<br/>
"Ah, Raphtalia-san. I’m home."<br/>
"Ah…?"<br/>
Raphtalia’s gaze shifts between my face, and my brother’s. A worried expression comes on her face as she inclines her head to one side.<br/>
I mean, it’s true, isn’t it? Raphtalia’s never met this guy before.<br/>
I mean, we never went back far enough for the two to have had a chance to meet.<br/>
"What’s wrong?"<br/>
"No, I was just wondering why you knew about Raphtalia." (Naofumi)<br/>
I mean, he greeted her quite naturally, just now.<br/>
"What do you mean by why?"<br/>
As if he thought I was mocking him, my brother makes a sullen expression.<br/>
"For argument’s sake, you see." (Naofumi)<br/>
"Hah? Nii-san, are you going senile? Are you having premature dementia?"<br/>
"Shut up. Just tell me." (Naofumi)<br/>
"When you’re just Nii-chan, you’re trying to give me orders?"<br/>
This is the hierarchy of the Iwatani Household.<br/>
It may be a bit late, but that’s quite a line he threw out there.<br/>
Since I went to that world, I get the feeling I’ve been harrassed by a lot of strange people, but it was like that from the start?<br/>
But that’s not the problem.<br/>
"Like I care." (Naofumi)<br/>
"Seriously, what’s wrong, Nii-san? Your usual loose eloquence and bullshittery is gone, man."<br/>
Who has loose eloquence!?<br/>
I always kinda wanted to return, but I shed tears upon receiving this treatment upon my return.<br/>
Why must my own younger brother wring me out like this?<br/>
"Don’t worry about it, just speak." (Naofumi)<br/>
"Have you finally awoken to your role as the eldest son? How out of character of you."<br/>
"Why are your eyes sparkling at that? You’ve always just had to add on that one extra sentence, haven’t you." (Naofumi)<br/>
"If it’s against Nii-san, then I won’t lose!"<br/>
My younger brother suddenly takes up a fighting pose.<br/>
Despite how he looks, this guy practices Kendo, I think.<br/>
He also did Karate.<br/>
Oy, there’s a world out there in need of a Hero.<br/>
Ah, don’t make a mistake and get hit by a truck, or anything.<br/>
I have a personal grudge against reincarnations at the moment.<br/>
"I didn’t intend to get into fisticuffs with you!" (Naofumi)<br/>
"Now, be more and more willful! I’ll take on your challenge anytime!"<br/>
What’s with him?<br/>
Did he have this sort of personality?<br/>
"Just answer the question already!" (Naofumi)<br/>
"I-I got it…"<br/>
With a bit of sadness, but a lot more joy, my younger brother begins to speak.<br/>
Was he merely joking around?<br/>
"When Nii-san entered college, Raphtalia-san came to our house to homestay as a foreign exchange student."<br/>
"… Foreign exchange student. Homestay, is it?" (Naofumi)<br/>
"Wasn’t she your friend on the net, Nii-san? You spoke to mom and dad, and she came over to our house, and just like that, she became your girlfriend, didn’t she, Nii-san?"<br/>
Okay, let’s organize this information.<br/>
It seems that here, Raphtalia is treated as a foreign exchange student staying in this house, under the same roof as me?<br/>
And she’s my girlfriend. What’s more, with parental recognition?<br/>
Just what sort of romcom is this?<br/>
"What country did Raphtalia come from again?" (Naofumi)<br/>
"I don’t know that. I think you told me before, though. What was it again?"<br/>
Brother makes a tantalizing expression as he tries to recall the country name.<br/>
No, I don’t think even Raphtalia knows the country she’s supposed to be from.<br/>
It’s that. Should I just say Melromark in another world?<br/>
Her nationality is otherworlder. That phrase pops up in my head.<br/>
No, I really can’t laugh at that.<br/>
"Ah, Nii-san sure has it nice. Having someone like Raphtalia-san as your girlfriend."<br/>
"G-girlfriend…" (Raphtalia)<br/>
Raphtalia embarrassingly touches her hands to her reddening face.<br/>
Her reaction is top notch.<br/>
"But you have one too, don’t you?" (Naofumi)<br/>
In the past, he said something like"Unlike me, the girlfriend-less Nii-san is pitiful. Do you plan on becoming a wizard or something?" to provoke me.<br/>
Though I just laughed it off back then.<br/>
Thinking back now, it really pisses me off.<br/>
"Yeah, but compared to Raphtalia-san… I’m jealous of Nii-san! Raphtalia-san, can you forget Nii-san, and transfer to someone with better future prospects like me?"<br/>
"Not happening." (Raphtalia)<br/>
That was fast.<br/>
Raphtalia’s quick and natural answer frightened me a bit.<br/>
It’s a mixture of happiness and embarrassment. A strange feeling.<br/>
… Let’s continue the conversation.<br/>
Lil’ brother continues to speak fluidly while nodding.<br/>
Aren’t you the one with the loose eloquence?<br/>
"As I thought."<br/>
"I’m definitely tattling to your girlfriend later." (Naofumi)<br/>
"S-stop! If strange rumors get around, I’ll be troubled."<br/>
Well, he’s a girlfriend-holding Riajuu in his third year of high school.<br/>
But if his girlfriend heard that line, I think he would be smacked the hell out of.<br/>
Just what sort of Galge heroine is he supposed to be?<br/>
"Anyways, don’t going around saying strange things."<br/>
"That depends on your attitude." (Naofumi)<br/>
"Nii-san, what’s wrong? You’re much colder than before."<br/>
"I thought I would have to be stricter from here on." (Naofumi)<br/>
Is what I’ll answer for now.<br/>
I see my long time spent in another world has changed me enough for people to notice.<br/>
"I see, yep. It looks like Nii-san has gotten just a bit cooler. In the past, you were kind, or how should I put it, too soft, so I like the atmosphere you’re giving off right now. Good luck with that, Nii-san."<br/>
Is what I thought, but my brother takes the change positively.<br/>
"More importantly, you." (Naofumi)<br/>
I’ll take this chance to gather some information.<br/>
I point to Raphtalia’s ears.<br/>
"What do you think of these?" (Naofumi)<br/>
"Meaning?"<br/>
"No, I mean…" (Naofumi)<br/>
"What?"<br/>
… I lightly poke the ears.<br/>
Raphtalia reluctantly twitches them back and forth.<br/>
"I mean these." (Naofumi)<br/>
"And again, what?"<br/>
… Can he not see them?<br/>
I gently lift up the tail.<br/>
"Ah…"<br/>
Raphtalia lets out an embarrassed moan.<br/>
It is quite a sensitive spot, it seems. I’m a bit sorry, but there’s no helping it.<br/>
"Next is this." (Naofumi)<br/>
"I have no idea what you’ve been trying to show me for a while. Are you bragging?"<br/>
Fumu… Raphtalia’s ears and tail aren’t being recognized by his senses.<br/>
Then what people were looking at when we walked down the street was simply her beauty.<br/>
"Now then, Nii-san. Food, please."<br/>
… Why does he want my food so much?<br/>
Is he supposed to be some loin-clothed dog?<br/>
"Can’t you just wait until mom comes home?" (Naofumi)<br/>
"You promised!"<br/>
Ah, for the love of god! Even when I’m supposed to be busy!<br/>
"Naofumi-sa, n, how about you make it for him?" (Raphtalia)<br/>
"Ah, see? Raphtalia-san gets it~!"<br/>
Little brother’s tension rises.<br/>
In the end… I ended up making dinner.<br/>
Why is the first thing I do upon returning from another world making dinner for my brother?<br/>
What’s more, while I was in the kitchen, mom came home. She walked to the living room, and started chatting with Raphtalia as if it were natural while munching on senbei.<br/>
(TL: Senbei are Japanese rice crackers)<br/>
She seems unnaturally close to Raphtalia, contrarily making my discomfort grow to massive proportions.<br/>
Well, the individual herself seems to be uncomfortable as well.<br/>
"Raphtalia-san, in the end, what did Naofumi-san do all day?"<br/>
"Umm…" (Raphtalia)<br/>
He went to another world, and ended up getting killed by a goddess.<br/>
Is something we can’t say.<br/>
"He was playing games again, right? You need to get him to pull himself together."<br/>
From my experience over there, I’d like to offer a complaint or two.<br/>
But here… it seems my day = gaming.<br/>
In truth, it really was like that before I went to that world, but it grates my nerves when they actually say it.<br/>
"Y-yes." (Raphtalia)<br/>
Being troubled with an answer, Raphtalia gives a response as not to cause any trouble.<br/>
After that, for some reason, I ended up making enough food for the whole family, and finally, I headed for my room with Raphtalia.<br/>
Well, it’s not like I didn’t do chores whenever I felt like it, but…<br/>
And for some reason, Raphtalia’s room was on the second floor as well.<br/>
If memories serves right, that should have been a storage room, or something of the sort.<br/>
"What do you think has happened?" (Raphtalia)<br/>
"A place for you in this world has been made… the Spirit of the Shield did say he could tamper with cause and effect to some extent so that I could bring someone along." (Naofumi)<br/>
It’s likely that this is the tampered world.<br/>
Just how thorough was he?<br/>
Anyways, after finishing the menial labor, I led Raphtalia, and returned to my room.<br/>
I didn’t notice it because I was depressed over being forced to cook, but I had casually brought Raphtalia into the room.<br/>
"It’s a bit narrow, isn’t it?" (Raphtalia)<br/>
Well, compared to the house in the village, of course my room is narrow.<br/>
I thought my room would make her draw back, but it seems that’s not the case.<br/>
If I had to decide I would assume she just didn’t know what anything there was.<br/>
"T-that’s right." (Naofumi)<br/>
"So this is Naofumi-sa, n’s room?" (Raphtalia)<br/>
Raphtalia restlessly surveys the inside.<br/>
The posters and figures are in the closet.<br/>
There’s only Manga left around.<br/>
"Are these books?" (Raphtalia)<br/>
"Yeah." (Naofumi)<br/>
"Is it alright if I read them?" (Raphtalia)<br/>
"Can you read them?" (Naofumi)<br/>
She doesn’t know the lettering system.<br/>
But if you think about it, you can understand some manga just by the art.<br/>
Raphtalia pulls a volume of Manga out of the bookshelf, and opens it.<br/>
Its contents were of a normal highs school boy and girl’s club activities. It was a typical romcom.<br/>
"/is this about the place nobles go to study?" (Raphtalia)<br/>
"Well, it’s a characteristic of or culture, per say, if I were to put it simply…" (Naofumi)<br/>
"This resembles the art from the Hero of the Spear, and the Tailor." (Raphtalia)<br/>
Yep… those two did it.<br/>
It was actually quite popular in the village.<br/>
The Tailor did look like someone who would draw Doujinshi. And yes, she did end up drawing them.<br/>
Motoyasu’s were ero-doujins. They were mainly of steamy love with Firo.<br/>
But those were just him venting out his emotions.<br/>
In that sense, Manga existed in that world.<br/>
Though the genre was a bit biased.<br/>
I truly had absolutely no interest, so I didn’t really remember it.<br/>
"Ah, right. Raphtalia, please remember this." (Naofumi)<br/>
"What could it be?" (Raphtalia)<br/>
"In this world, in the country I live in, almost all of the people around our age attends school. You’re probably going to be treated as if you’re attending as well." (Naofumi)<br/>
"M-me too? To study for nobility?" (Raphtalia)<br/>
The place for nobles to study… It seems I’ll have to offer a bit of explanation.<br/>
Well, I’ll put that matter aside for now. As long as she understands that.<br/>
"Yeah, so until we figure something out, we’ll have to live our lives here. And so, let’s try hard to get you to fit in here." (Naofumi)<br/>
"Y-yes.." (Raphtalia)<br/>
First, I’ll have to teach her how to read and write.<br/>
Hmm.<br/>
By the way, I checked the Four Holy Weapons’ Manual after that, and it showed absolutely no change.<br/>
