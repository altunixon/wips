Chapter 4<br/>
<br/>
1<br/>
The next day, the 31st of the Blue month, the number of escorts increased to four.<br/>
This was because of the ominous warning by Kamyua Yost and Ai Fa’s comment that she could sense someone watching us.<br/>
The additional members were Shin Wu and a youth from the Wu clan branch house I wasn’t familiar with. Unfortunately, we couldn’t ask the head of the Lei house Rau Lei to be our guard so easily.<br/>
"And Rau Lei has a short fuse. Aren’t you worried about him interacting with the people in town?"<br/>
These were Ludo Wu’s actual words.<br/>
If Donda Wu was worried about that when making this decision, it was indeed an appropriate concern. I wouldn’t be surprised for the people of the city to use some sort of scheme in town.<br/>
We could only start doing the day’s work, with no idea how guarded we should be.<br/>
Aside from the possibility of Pyschkurewuss acting behind the scenes, there was another matter lingering in the corner of my heart.<br/>
And, of course, it’s about Shumimaru’s leaving Genos today and the issue with Vena Wu.<br/>
"… Vena Wu, is your leg fine?"<br/>
While attending to the "Myam-roasted meat" stall I directed my question towards the "Kiba burger" stall, and Vena Wu responded calmly: "Yes… I’m fine…"<br/>
Vena Wu had finally returned to her job at the stall.<br/>
But the feet she was concealing had not recovered completely yet, so she couldn’t return to her job without a wagon ferrying her.<br/>
And with the guards here, there was no need for Vena Wu to stay with me. She had asked Mama Mia Lei to let Leina Wu and her to work at the Post Station Town on alternate days.<br/>
"Erm, when is that easterner coming?"<br/>
Lala Wu who was tending the "Myam-roasted meat" stall asked softly.<br/>
"Who knows. Usually, he would be here by now."<br/>
"Ah… I’m getting worked up over this. He isn’t proposing marriage, so why am I so flustered?"<br/>
I was flustered too, but I didn’t know whether it was due to the same reason as Lala Wu.<br/>
Speaking of which, why was Lala Wu so worked up?<br/>
"I don’t understand! But, do you think that easterner's intentions are so serious so he would propose a marriage? That’s why I’m so flustered."<br/>
Lala Wu put her hand on her chest as she said that, and took a deep breath.<br/>
"It will be great if Vena-nee finds a good husband soon. Then things won’t become so troubling!"<br/>
"… Is it troubling for Shumimaru and Vena Wu to be together?"<br/>
"Obviously! By the way… I’m not too sure, but is changing one’s faith a serious matter in town?"<br/>
"I’m not very sure, but it seems so."<br/>
"Ah, Asuta doesn’t know about the four gods in the first place. What an incredible tale! Anyway… Changing faith means cutting ties with their family, you know? I don’t want that!"<br/>
"Well, living apart doesn’t mean that you won’t see each other again… Ah, how do I put this… I better not say something irresponsible."<br/>
"It’s the same everywhere; marrying away means living apart from one’s family. I don’t want Vena-nee to leave Forest’s Edge and not be a tribe mate anymore."<br/>
Lala Wu lowered her brows slightly and bit her lips.<br/>
This strong-willed girl would occasionally show such a cute face.<br/>
"… What about a foreigner marrying into the Wu clan?"<br/>
"Huh? That’s good I guess? Then Vena-nee will still be my family."<br/>
"Ah, so that works?"<br/>
"I don’t really mind. Mama Mia Lei probably won’t mind either. I’m not sure about Papa Donda…"<br/>
Donda Wu, huh.<br/>
I wondered what were his thoughts on this.<br/>
"He probably won’t agree. If the easterner marries in, he can’t do the work of a hunter properly. He does business in the Genos city, right? Why would such a man give up his lifestyle and marry into Forest’s Edge?"<br/>
"So Lala Wu wouldn’t mind?"<br/>
"Yes. I’m fine with anyone as long as Vena-nee is happy."<br/>
Lala Wu resembled Ludo Wu not just in their expressions, but thinking as well.<br/>
Anyway, Ludo Wu wished his sister to be happy even if Vena Wu were to leave Forest’s Edge.<br/>
But their marriage isn’t that easy…<br/>
Abandoning one’s hometown, friends, and way of life, and marrying into Forest’s Edge… Even a foreigner like me could imagine how preposterous this was.<br/>
What about marrying out?<br/>
Vena Wu yearned for the world outside of Forest’s Edge too.<br/>
And the denizens of Forest’s Edge worshipped the forest as a god and didn’t display any devotion towards the four main deities. In that case, they were less resistant to the idea of changing one’s faith.<br/>
But I didn’t think this was such a simple matter. Even if the subject herself wasn’t resistant to this idea, she wouldn’t be able to live in the western kingdom and the Forest’s Edge, if she changed her faith.<br/>
Shumimaru didn’t have any family and ran a business. After leaving his hometown, he would tour around the western and northern kingdom for almost a year. He definitely couldn’t leave Vena Wu in Semu alone, since she didn’t know anyone there.<br/>
Then he just needed to tour the world together with Vena Wu…<br/>
No, that wasn’t realistic at all.<br/>
Shumimaru must have had considered all these, which was why he told me it was difficult.<br/>
Anyway… I can only hope that Vena Wu will accept Shumimaru’s gift.<br/>
With worry and tiredness rising in our mind, Lala Wu and I sighed.<br/>
At this moment, Ai Fa said coldly: "She’s here again…"<br/>
"How annoying! Is this your attitude towards a customer?"<br/>
It was the southern girl Dell.<br/>
Dell stuck her tongue out at Ai Fa who was acting like a bouncer and then stood before the "Myam-roasted meat" stall with a smile.<br/>
"I’m visiting again today! Asuta, I have a request."<br/>
"Ahh, welcome. Hmm…? If you are alternating every day, shouldn’t you be buying "Kiba burger" today?"<br/>
"Hmm? It’s fine since it’s tasty! Asuta is over here, so I want this one."<br/>
Her first day’s attitude was like a lie. Dell smiled brightly, and Ai Fa crossed her arms and glared at me when she saw that innocent smile.<br/>
Actually, I told Kamyua Yost about this girl yesterday. It was very unlikely for Pyschkurewuss to be involved with a girl like her visiting my stall.<br/>
"Oh, the merchants from Zealand? I know them; they are the steel smith merchants that got invited to stay in Pyschkurewuss’ manor. Malfreed has already investigated the people visiting Genos recently. They are here purely for business and are neither the pawns of Pyschkurewuss nor will do anything to the denizens of Forest’s Edge."<br/>
Kamyua Yost’s words wiped away my worries for now.<br/>
But the fact remained that they were involved with Pyschkurewuss, so I should still keep my distance. So I wore my professional smile and attended to this girl.<br/>
"Ah, smells nice! Can this be reheated in the stove?"<br/>
"Huh? But why?"<br/>
"I want the people in the city to try it too! They all say that kiba isn’t edible and won’t believe me at all!"<br/>
Her words gave me goosebumps.<br/>
"E-Erm, the dish will spoil after some time! It will be bad if you get food poisoning. So please don’t bring the dish into the city."<br/>
"Huh!? Since I bought it with my money, I’m free to do whatever I want with it."<br/>
Dell stopped smiling and puffed her cheeks.<br/>
"B-But many people in Genos don’t welcome the denizens of Forest’s Edge and kiba. You know that, right?"<br/>
"Hmm? I don’t really know, but there are many denizens of Forest’s Edge who look scary, so they are just intimidated by them, correct?"<br/>
Dell said as she looked at Ai Fa with loathsome eyes.<br/>
Ai Fa looked back at her icily.<br/>
"This is not that simple. The kiba is a symbol of disaster, so the denizens of Forest’s Edge who eat kiba get treated as the harbinger of catastrophe… And they also changed their faith from the southern god to the western one. Because of their heritage, people don’t see them as fellow citizens, and the relationship with the townsfolk didn’t improve after all this time."<br/>
"What? That’s too strange! The denizens of Forest’s Edge abandoned Jaguar decades ago and still aren’t accepted as fellow citizens here?"<br/>
I was shocked; she didn’t even know that?<br/>
So that was the extent of what a foreigner doing business in the city would know. Despite being fellow Genos citizens, the people in the city and the denizens of Forest’s Edge had no proper interactions at all. Pyschkurewuss was the only exception, and I didn’t think he would take the chance to talk about the Forest’s Edge with merchants.<br/>
That’s right… someone in the city might never have the chance to meet a denizen of Forest’s Edge. The relationship between the Post Station townsfolk and the denizens of Forest’s Edge is of no importance to them.<br/>
This was a new revelation.<br/>
However, what kind of answer would denizens of Forest’s Edge get if they asked this question?<br/>
I decided to focus on the problem at hand right now and answered Dell:<br/>
"… Anyway, I can imagine the troubles that will be caused by bringing a kiba dish into the city. I still want to run my business in peace here, so can you reconsider?"<br/>
Dell moaned for a while and then answered disappointedly: "Okay."<br/>
"I just want to surprise them. But… if it will cause trouble for Asuta, I will give it up."<br/>
Her face looked like a puppy with droopy ears.<br/>
After thanking her, I tossed the meat and aria into the middle of the griddle.<br/>
"Just one? That will be two red copper plates."<br/>
"Yes! I didn’t eat anything before coming, so make it tastier, alright?"<br/>
Dell cheered up and smiled gleefully.<br/>
As her infectious smile made me smile in return, I heard the voice of a new customer: "Ahh, long time no see!"<br/>
I turned back and found a westerner girl with long brown hair standing there with a smile as bright as Dell’s. Her figure was as thicc as Vena Wu, and her ivory skin looked rather sexy. She was Yumi from the 《West Wind Inn》.<br/>
"Ah, hello. It has been a while."<br/>
"I have to work in the inn, so it’s hard for me to sneak out before noon! But I still came every day, you know?"<br/>
"Yes, I heard about that. Thank you for your regular patronage."<br/>
She and Uncle Dora were westerner regulars which was rare in my stall. I had less chance of seeing them now, but I was still grateful towards them.<br/>
Will she… find trouble with western customers?<br/>
I looked away uneasily, and Dell put her hands on the counter like a dog begging for food. Her escort Lavis had already handed the money to Lala Wu.<br/>
"Ah, pardon me. I will make it right away, so wait a moment."<br/>
"Yes!"<br/>
Dell smiled brilliantly. She was the world’s best in terms of the speed her face changed.<br/>
And, for some reason, Yumi stopped smiling and started observing Dell.<br/>
"I have never seen you before. Are you a friend of Asuta?"<br/>
"Hmm? We aren’t really friends though?"<br/>
Dell looked back at her puzzledly.<br/>
Yumi flicked her hair with a grunt.<br/>
"You are a regular of this stall then? I don’t remember seeing a southern girl like you."<br/>
"Regular, huh. I have visited four days in a row!"<br/>
I shrugged quietly. She hadn’t paid for the first day yet.<br/>
But now wasn’t the time to take it easy. Yumi stared at me, her gaze turning icier with every passing moment.<br/>
"… Asuta, what’s going on here?"<br/>
"Ah? W-What do you mean?"<br/>
"Didn’t you say you use honorifics with me because I’m a customer!? Then why do you speak to a little girl that just came four days ago like a friend!?"<br/>
That seemed to have triggered Yumi.<br/>
By the way, I remember Yumi saying the same thing to a kid like Tara. She only relented when I explained to her that I got to know Tara before opening the stall.<br/>
"N-No, that’s… It became like this before I realized it…"<br/>
"Before you realized it? I don’t get you!"<br/>
"How annoying. If you are here to buy food, just eat it quietly."<br/>
Dell took a bite of the "Myam-roasted meat" I gave her and answered calmly.<br/>
Did the pot just call the kettle black!? Even though I was thinking about that in my heart, Dell didn’t seem agitated about Yumi getting mad, which was a relief. It looked that Dell could deal with southerners and westerners reasonably.<br/>
"… Asuta, you have two choices."<br/>
But Yumi was already fuming.<br/>
Yumi raised two tender fingers with an angry face and shoved them up to the tip of my nose.<br/>
"You can either stop talking to me in such a formal tone, or you can treat all your patrons the same way. Asuta, what will you choose?"<br/>
"Erm… It’s difficult to change the way I have been speaking for the past month…"<br/>
"So you won’t talk to me in a formal tone now, correct?"<br/>
Dell smiled angelically.<br/>
I didn’t know whether she would cry or get mad if I failed to meet her expectations, and just thinking about it put my heart in a turmoil. That was how her smile was.<br/>
So I could only answer: "Yes.". Yumi yelled: "That’s too sly!" when she heard that.<br/>
"Don’t just bully me! And I have known you for longer than her, how mean!"<br/>
"You are too loud. I’m going to call the guards on you for disrupting his business, you know?"<br/>
Dell took large bites of her "Myam-roasted meat" with a satisfied smile, while I sighed without letting Yumi notice.<br/>
I only noticed an icy gaze staring at my right cheek.<br/>
I turned back and it was my beloved house head casting a sideway gaze at me.<br/>
I asked her why she was mad with my eyes. She answered with her gaze that I was being annoying.<br/>
We were of one mind, which showed the bonds within the Fa house.<br/>
"Erm… I can’t do this right away; we need to find a way to resolve this in a more peaceful manner…"<br/>
I said in an attempt to mediate, but Yumi leaned towards me with her brows raised high.<br/>
"Are you serious about trying to change…?"<br/>
"Yes… Erm… I will do what I can…"<br/>
Yumi sighed heavily and then put two red copper plates onto the counter.<br/>
"Thank you for your patronage… No, thanks…"<br/>
"I don’t feel you are trying at all!"<br/>
"I can’t change immediately."<br/>
I started cooking the "Myam-roasted meat". She was better than Rau Lei who resorted to violence immediately.<br/>
Yumi looked at Dell haughtily.<br/>
"… Just who are you? It’s rare seeing a southern girl in Genos; is your family merchants?"<br/>
"Yes, I’m with a steel smith merchant from Zealand."<br/>
Dell answered Yumi impatiently as she finished off her food.<br/>
"Fufu, a steel smith merchant, huh. That has nothing to do with me… But why are you wearing boy’s clothes?"<br/>
"Hmm…? How can I wear flimsy clothes in the Post Station Town? It’s me who should be asking you, aren’t you afraid of being targeted by delinquents if you dressed like that?"<br/>
"If I was afraid of delinquents, I wouldn’t live in the Post Station Town. You sure are delicate."<br/>
Yumi looked down at Dell with her arms crossed.<br/>
When I first met this girl, she was with a group of delinquent-like youths.<br/>
By the way, she was wearing a tank top and had accessories that clattered noisily and a long dress that went from her waist to her ankles. This was a popular attire amongst westerners. Her feet that were showing under her dress looked really mesmerizing.<br/>
"Hmm, I don’t understand this custom. Since you are so cute, why don’t you grow your hair out? Otherwise you’ll get mistaken for a boy."<br/>
Yes, I was one of those who were mistaken.<br/>
When I was just thinking that, Dell’s calm face started turning flushed.<br/>
"Annoying! I’m free to cut or grow out my hair!? Don’t tease me just because you look a little pretty!"<br/>
"Uwah!"<br/>
Yumi let out a weird scream.<br/>
I never expected for Dell to grab one of Yumi’s soft breasts with her right hand.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Yumi shook off Dell’s hand and sat onto the ground weakly with her face red.<br/>
"W-What are you doing!? Don’t surprise me like that!"<br/>
"Hmmp! So you are fine with that if I don’t surprise you? Shall I tell you in advance next time?"<br/>
Dell curled her fingers into a wriggly claw and went near Yumi.<br/>
Yumi backed away with her arms around herself.<br/>
At this moment, Ai Fa grabbed Dell’s slender shoulders and said: "Hey! Don’t cause trouble in front of the stall. Girl from the south, you are not reflecting on your actions at all."<br/>
Dell looked back at Ai Fa in surprise.<br/>
And then, the young man Lavis who had been standing at the side like a shadow walked towards Ai Fa with his hand on his sword hilt.<br/>
"Denizen of Forest’s Edge, remove your hand from Dell-sama. If not… I won’t hold back."<br/>
"Oh? So there are many southerners with no regards for the law."<br/>
Ai Fa didn’t waver at all as she unhanded Dell.<br/>
Dell said a little agitatedly in a quiet voice: "Don’t be like this, Lavis."<br/>
"It’s my fault. Asuta… I’m sorry."<br/>
"Ah, it’s fine…"<br/>
"I apologize to you too. I… can’t help myself when people talk about my hair."<br/>
"H-Hair…?"<br/>
"… My hair color is disgusting so it won’t look as nice as yours even if I grow it out. If not for that, I wouldn’t want others to mistake me for a boy too."<br/>
Dell bit her lips quietly after saying that.<br/>
Yumi stood up slowly and walked to Dell with her hands guarding her breasts.<br/>
"… What’s so disgusting about it? Your hair color is just a little uncommon."<br/>
"It is! It’s like the color of feral animals!"<br/>
Dell’s face twisted sadly as she ruffled her hair.<br/>
The color of her brown hair was uneven and did look a little like that of a cat or dog. But I didn’t find it disgusting at all.<br/>
"Is that so. But everyone has their own preferences."<br/>
Yumi put her hands on Dell’s messy hair.<br/>
"But I don’t think this color is disgusting, that’s why I want you to grow it out. Sorry if that upset you."<br/>
Dell lowered her head without a word.<br/>
Yumi had a sincere and apologetic face.<br/>
"… Y-You aren’t mad?"<br/>
"Yes. I was just surprised."<br/>
"I see. It… felt really soft and comfortable though."<br/>
Yumi ruffled Dell’s hair roughly: "Don’t say it out loud!"<br/>
Dell fled from her with a laugh.<br/>
"Sorry, I will be heading back now. I still have a job to do in the afternoon. Asuta… Can I come tomorrow?"<br/>
"Huh? Yes, of course."<br/>
Dell left with brisk steps after saying: "… Thanks."<br/>
Lavis followed her after glaring at Ai Fa.<br/>
"What a weirdo! But never mind… She isn’t a bad person.":<br/>
Yumi said with a sigh.<br/>
"Are you alright?"<br/>
When she heard me, she guarded her breasts for some reason and glared at me with scary eyes.<br/>
"Hurry up already! I have work to do too!"<br/>
"Oh? Yes, my deep apologies…"<br/>
"Language!"<br/>
"Right! My bad!"<br/>
My manner of speech was like Mida’s right now.<br/>
Lala Wu held back her laugh as she turned away, while Yumi snatched the "Myam-roasted meat" from me in a rage.<br/>
"Really now, I’m here for formal business with you, but it got messed up… Well, Asuta, you are selling your food at the 《Big Tree of the South Inn》 and the 《Cryptic Venerable Inn》, right?"<br/>
"Hmm? Erm, yes?"<br/>
"So you adjusted the taste according to the preferences of the southerners and easterners, correct? For a westerner like me, which inn would you recommend?"<br/>
"Huh? May I ask the reason for your query?"<br/>
"Are you doing that on purpose?"<br/>
"No, of course not!"<br/>
Lala Wu’s shoulders were quivering, and Yumi sighed.<br/>
"Recently, I noticed we are losing westerner customers to these two inns. My dad has finally made up his mind."<br/>
"Finally… What does he want to do?"<br/>
"I don’t know yet. Maybe he wants Asuta to make some karon or kimyusu meat dish."<br/>
Yumi’s father, the innkeeper of the 《West Wind Inn》, seemed very wary of the denizens of Forest’s Edge and kiba.<br/>
But he wasn’t born and bred in Genos, and only moved here from another town when he was young. His hatred didn’t have any specific reason; he was just affected by the atmosphere in the Post Station Town. That was what Yumi deduced.<br/>
Which meant that Yumi was wary of the denizens of Forest’s Edge for the same reason too. Her hatred faded off after meeting me at my stall.<br/>
"Yes, but it will be meaningless if I don’t use kiba in the dish. Like I mentioned last time, instead of making money, I started doing business in order to let everyone understand how delicious kiba is."<br/>
"Yes, I know. But my stubborn dad has sent me here to try your dish in order to ascertain Asuta’s skills. Not long ago, he got mad at me and my mom when I bought your cooking in secret! Isn’t that amazing?"<br/>
Yumi then leaned her face over the counter with a serious face.<br/>
"What happens next would depend on Asuta’s capability. If Asuta manages to convince my dad to try the kiba dish, we can smash that rock head of his into smithereens! Ah… Did I say something wilful again?"<br/>
"No, you are right. Just getting him interested will make me happy."<br/>
Selling kiba for westerner travelers in an inn operated by westerners would be a big improvement.<br/>
If possible, I wanted to take this first step in the 《Kimyusu’s Tail Inn》, but I couldn’t let this chance slip.<br/>
I also learned that the evidence of that incident a decade of ago wasn’t treated seriously. If Pyschkurewuss isn’t targeting Milano Mast, I can just talk about that incident openly in the 《Kimyusu’s Tail Inn》.<br/>
I showed a forthright smile towards Yumi as I thought about this.<br/>
"Thank you. If Yumi’s father is really interested, I will work hard to make him understand the deliciousness of kiba."<br/>
Yumi opened her eyes wide.<br/>
Her ivory skin looked a little red, maybe because of the heat from the griddle.<br/>
"… So you can talk properly after all."<br/>
"Ah, is that so? I might get conscious of it once I calm down though."<br/>
"And… You remembered my name?"<br/>
"Huh? I remembered your name a long time ago!"<br/>
That might be so, but I never had the chance to call her by her name. Not just Yumi, I had not addressed Pops Balan and Arudas by their names either.<br/>
Yumi giggled and then pulled her body back.<br/>
"I’m glad…"<br/>
"Hmm? Glad about what?"<br/>
"Nothing! The 《Big Tree of the South Inn》 and the 《Cryptic Venerable Inn》, which do you recommend?"<br/>
"Erm, well, I plan to change the menu slowly tomorrow, but the dish in the 《Cryptic Venerable Inn》 uses a spice from Semu called Chitto, so the food from the 《Big Tree of the South Inn》 should suit you better. By the way… Have you tried dishes made with Tau sauce before?"<br/>
"I never tried it before, but that’s a seasoning from Jaguar, correct? I heard that name before."<br/>
"Is that so? It doesn’t taste as strong as Chitto, so I think it will be easier for others to accept. In any case, I don’t just focus on the easterners or southerners alone when I set my menu."<br/>
"I understand. I will try the 《Big Tree of the South Inn》 then! I’m looking forward to it."<br/>
Yumi then smiled more brilliantly than before, which was great.<br/>
"Thank you. I won’t waste the opportunity given to me by Yumi and will work hard."<br/>
"Yes! Do your best! But I can only tell the truth if it really does taste bad though."<br/>
"Yes, I’m looking forward to Yumi’s thoughts on this."<br/>
I breathed a sigh of relief as I watched the smiling Yumi leave.<br/>
I then felt a gaze on my right cheek.<br/>
Turning back, I found Ai Fa staring silently at me.<br/>
I asked with my eyes what she was being mad about.<br/>
She answered with her gaze that I was annoying.<br/>
Our wordless conversation wasn’t so cheery this time.<br/>
As I was thinking that, a tall cloaked figure approached us from the north.<br/>
It was an easterner. But it wasn’t Shumimaru or Sangjura. This person was easily over 190 cm tall, which was rare even for a Semu.<br/>
"Welcome. Do you want one?"<br/>
"No, two, give me."<br/>
He replied as he pushed his hood away.<br/>
Aside from Shumimaru and Sangjura, no one else had ever gone out of their way to show their face.<br/>
"Asuta, me, you know?"<br/>
"Huh?"<br/>
"Me, ‘Silver Vase’ deputy bandleader, Radajiddo Nafashiāru."<br/>
I didn’t recognize him at all. He had dark hair and eyes, and his long face was typical of a Semu.<br/>
But I did remember someone this tall amongst the members of the Silver Vase.<br/>
"So you are a part of the ‘Silver Vase’. Are you alone today?"<br/>
"Yes. Today, busy. Everyone, buy food, separate."<br/>
With that, Radajiddo turned his gaze towards the "Kiba burger" stall.<br/>
"Asuta, Vena Wu, something tell you, I have."<br/>
Vena Wu turned slowly towards him.<br/>
Radajiddo continued in a strong and booming voice:<br/>
"Bandleader Shumimaru, urgent matter. Will come late, Asuta, Vena Wu."<br/>
I asked him: "An urgent matter?"<br/>
Radajiddo nodded at Vena Wu.<br/>
"Close stall, he come. Go 《Kimyusu’s Tail Inn》, he will. Time come, bid farewell."<br/>
"I see. As expected, he is busy on the very last day. Hmm… But does Shumimaru know that Vena Wu is in the Post Station Town today?"<br/>
"Knows he. Shumimaru, since morning, in city. But brethren, about stall, inform him. Shumimaru, knows."<br/>
"I see."<br/>
Speaking of which, it was almost noon and Pops Balan still hadn’t come.<br/>
The excitement of my conversation with Yumi started to subside.<br/>
"Shumimaru, come, definitely. Lunch, give him, I will."<br/>
Radajiddo said as he returned his gaze back to me.<br/>
"‘Silver Vase’, ten people, come definitely. We, meet Asuta, thank you."<br/>
"No, I’m the one who should be grateful for making your acquaintances."<br/>
Radajiddo said emotionlessly: "Farewell, close stall, after."<br/>
But I could feel a gleeful gaze similar to Shumimaru behind his squinting dark eyes.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
2<br/>
Afternoon, after Rii Sudora arrived to start her shift, we set off for the 《Cryptic Venerable Inn》.<br/>
I had already entrusted the jerky preordered by Pops Balan to Shela Wu. After asking the Wu clan and their six kin houses, and the five minor houses near us, we managed to gather 2 kg of jerky.<br/>
The revenue of 30 white copper plates was split amongst the twelve houses, so each house didn’t earn much this time. I gave priority to the minor houses the previous round, so I divided the task equally amongst all the houses this time.<br/>
And with permission from my house head, the Fa house also prepared a little gift for our regular guest.<br/>
The food I was researching right now was "Kiba bacon". I was trying to make the smoked jerky that was as tough as wood more tender.<br/>
The moisture was removed by covering it with salt, and the dried meat was then smoked with herbs. Forest’s Edge method of making jerky was basically the same as making bacon. But the priority in making jerky was its preservation effect, so the moisture needed to be completely removed. The end result was so tough that a weak person like me couldn’t bite through it.<br/>
There weren’t any chilling facilities here, and the weather in Forest’s Edge and Genos was like early summer in Japan, so it was only natural for them to prioritize preservation. However, I wanted to know if it was possible to make the bacon I was familiar with… Could I make it more tender by shortening its shelf life a little? Whenever the Fa house made jerky, I used a small portion of it for research.<br/>
Whether it was the amount of salt, the marinating time with salt, how long it was left to dry after removing the salt, the length of time used to smoke it with herbs, or other ways to improve the smoking method such as the possibility of using Pico leaves which could remove moisture efficiently… I tried all sorts of methods, but still had no answer at hand. Right now, I could only make bacon that was very close to being a jerky. I could barely manage to bite through it, and the shelf life was just a week.<br/>
It was still far from my ideal standard of a bacon. But if I imagined myself to be a traveler cooking it with poitan and aria, it would taste much better than normal jerky.<br/>
Jerky needed to be cooked until it turned into mush so it tasted like bland rubbery pieces of meat. But the bacon-like meat I made could retain its original flavor.<br/>
I used belly meat for this, as its fat had a thicker texture when made into jerky, so it greatly influenced the taste. I prepared 2 kg of such bacon meat for each group.<br/>
It had to be consumed within seven days and didn’t need to be cooked as long as jerky. This was a parting gift for their support of our stall for the past month, so they didn’t need to pay. I left the stall after telling Shela Wu about these three points.<br/>
Was doing this against the customs of the Post Station Town?<br/>
Even so, I still couldn’t suppress my feelings of wanting to present farewell gifts to Pops’ company of architects and the Silver Vase.<br/>
If I found out that Pops turned down the bacon when I linked up with the others, I would probably cry. With this unease in my heart, I went south down the stone-paved street towards 《Cryptic Venerable Inn》.<br/>
I was accompanied by Vena Wu, Shin Wu, and Ai Fa. Ludo Wu and the youth from the branch house stayed back in the stall.<br/>
Vena Wu sighed sadly beside me.<br/>
"… Vena Wu, are you okay?"<br/>
"Yes… I just want to settle this troublesome matter earlier…"<br/>
Her strides were brisk and favored her right leg a little. The profile of her face was emotionless, so, as expected, she was very melancholic.<br/>
Will she accept Shumimaru’s gift?<br/>
These words were stuck in my throat, and I managed to swallow them back.<br/>
Vena Wu had sort of confessed to me. Given my relationship with her, it wasn’t really convenient for me to ask her about Shumimaru.<br/>
Just what kind of emotions did Vena Wu have when flirting with me? What were the fundamental feelings she felt? Was it curiosity and obsession? Her yearning for the outside world? Or just pure feelings of love… I didn’t really understand, and Vena Wu probably didn’t either.<br/>
The denizens of Forest’s Edge probably relied more on instincts to choose a spouse, in contrast to my previous world. Mama Mia Lei already confessed to Donda Wu the second time they met, while their daughter Leina Wu fell for me very quickly.<br/>
Thinking that this was the custom in Forest’s Edge with just these two examples was probably jumping to conclusions. However, their family Vena Wu launched a more direct attack in an even shorter amount of time.<br/>
Just how did she think about Shumimaru.<br/>
What were her thoughts about Shumimaru’s feelings?<br/>
I didn’t really understand the way of this world, and couldn’t understand.<br/>
"… What’s the matter? You have been gloomy since just now."<br/>
Ai Fa walked over and leaned towards me.<br/>
"If you are worried about something, don’t hold it in, Asuta."<br/>
"No, I’m fine. I’m just thinking about something."<br/>
I shook my head at Ai Fa, whose gaze was twenty percent sharper than usual.<br/>
"What about you, Ai Fa? Is that gaze still there today?"<br/>
"It’s gone now. There were just a few people staring at us yesterday. It will be great if that’s the end of it."<br/>
If there wasn’t any concrete evidence, Ai Fa wouldn’t be able to relax.<br/>
But the next conference was half a month away.<br/>
The Wu clan which had started its hunting offseason was still alright, but Ai Fa couldn’t neglect her hunting work yet. Since there was less kiba around the Wu clan village, that meant the kiba was roaming in the other areas.<br/>
Due to the Tsun clan deserting their hunting duties, it disrupted the hunting cycle greatly. At the very least, the number of kiba around the Fa house didn’t decrease at all. The neighboring Fou and Lan houses were successful in their hunts too.<br/>
Ai Fa seemed to have understood what I was thinking and said: "… I’m thinking about hunting on alternate days before the 15th of the White Month. So I’m planning to take turns with the Wu clan to perform escort duties… Asuta, don’t cause any trouble while I’m not looking."<br/>
"I got it. By the way, did I ever cause trouble in the Post Station Town before?"<br/>
"Weren’t you punched by a southern girl a few days ago?"<br/>
Ai Fa poked my shoulder like an angry cat.<br/>
Whenever we talked about Dell, Ai Fa would get upset.<br/>
"… You two are really close, Ai Fa and Asuta…"<br/>
Vena Wu muttered softly.<br/>
Ai Fa suppressed her anger and then turned towards her:<br/>
"You seem listless. Does your foot still hurt, eldest daughter of the Wu clan?"<br/>
"I’m fine… My heart just aches when I see both of you acting lovey-dovey…"<br/>
I was shocked by her words.<br/>
However, Ai Fa just tilted her head puzzledly:<br/>
"Doesn’t the Wu clan have many family members? Why would you feel that way?"<br/>
"Are you serious…? I really can’t deal with you…"<br/>
A giant question mark appeared on top of Ai Fa’s head.<br/>
Vena Wu looked weakly at Ai Fa from the corner of her eyes and sighed.<br/>
"Don’t mind me… It’s my own problem…"<br/>
Ai Fa nodded and replied: "Is that so?"<br/>
She then continued with a rarely seen troubled expression:<br/>
"Grandma Jiba and Rimee Wu are in the Wu clan. With these two that I know very well there… I think the Wu clan is a blissful family."<br/>
"I understand… I cherish my family very much too…"<br/>
After saying that, Vena Wu covered her face with her long bangs.<br/>
I was probably the only one who heard what she said next.<br/>
"Just what am I hoping for…"<br/>
Vena Wu mumbled uneasily like a child.<br/>
Inside the 《Cryptic Venerable Inn》 kitchen, the innkeeper Neil said in a voice devoid of emotions: "Asuta, the contract will end today."<br/>
He was a young keeper less than thirty years of age and medium build. He had ivory skin, as well as brown hair and eyes, a typical westerner.<br/>
"Thank you very much for today… I hope to sign a new contract with you tomorrow."<br/>
"I’m honored by your words. However, like I explained just now, I will be switching the dish from tomorrow onwards and won’t be using pickled Chitto."<br/>
I replied as I lay out the ingredients I brought over onto the counter, and Neil said to me: "I’m actually looking forward to your next dish."<br/>
His sincere and friendly words didn’t match his emotionless face. This strange innkeeper had been trying hard to follow the customs of the easterners and didn’t reveal his emotions.<br/>
"I have done the seasoning, so I would like you to try the taste. I will be starting then."<br/>
Today’s dish was "Chitto hotpot" which was modeled after the kimchi hotpot.<br/>
It was a simple dish made by cooking kiba and tino in water and then adding pickled Chitto and Tau sauce. So I was free before the water boiled and could use the free time to make the new dish.<br/>
It was the "Kiba sauté- Arrabbiata style" that I asked Ai Fa and Shumimaru to try few days ago. A single portion was easy to make. I asked Vena Wu to watch the fire of the "Chitto hotpot" and then started working on the new dish quietly.<br/>
Ai Fa stood guard by the window, Shin Wu stayed at the entrance of the kitchen, and Neil stayed beside me to watch me cook. The kitchen in the 《Cryptic Venerable Inn》 was the smallest of all the inns I had visited, and it felt cramp with five people inside.<br/>
When we were guarding against Zattsu Tsun’s attack, there were four escorts. Back then, three of them stayed outside to watch the surroundings, the back, and the front door. But there were just two escorts this time, so the two of them concentrate their forces indoors.<br/>
Naudiz from the 《Big Tree of the South Inn》 was still a little afraid of the Forest’s Edge’s denizens, but Neil didn’t seem to be so. Engrossed in the Semu culture of the eastern kingdom, he felt sad about the differences and unrest between the four great kingdoms. The denizens of Forest’s Edge abandoned Jaguar and became citizens of Selva, so they were discriminated for their background. But he tried his best to treat the denizens of Forest’s Edge fairly and equally with no regards for all that.<br/>
He didn’t have the resolve to change his faith or make others change theirs, so he didn’t take an easterner as his wife. That’s what he said.<br/>
As expected, changing one’s faith in this world was a taboo.<br/>
The side that was abandoned would be unhappy, and the other side wouldn’t welcome him either. That was the reason why the denizens of Forest’s Edge were poorly received by the people in Genos.<br/>
What is the rationale behind this thinking? Do they think people who change faith can’t be trusted?<br/>
I heard that Kamyua Yost was a mixed blood of the north and west kingdom. His childhood was spent in the northern kingdom, and he moved to the western kingdom after his mother died.<br/>
Why would someone like Kamyua Yost be born between the enemy nations of Mahildra and Selva? I didn’t ask him the reason, but I knew he lived as a northerner with his mother in the past, and changed his faith to the one of westerners after his mother’s death. His strange experience had to be the key to molding his weird personality.<br/>
Kamyua once said he couldn’t find a proper job because of his heritage and that’s why he became a guardian. He felt a one-sided sense of camaraderie towards the denizens of Forest’s Edge who had similar experience as him.<br/>
Changing one’s religion wasn’t an easy decision for both Kamyua Yost and the denizens of Forest’s Edge, but they weren’t accepted by the western kingdom of Selva.<br/>
In that sense, converting one’s faith for the sake of marriage won’t bring them happiness.<br/>
I glanced at Vena Wu, who was standing silently beside the stove, and sighed quietly.<br/>
After the meat and aria were cooked, I poured the tarapa sauce I prepared into the pot.<br/>
"Is that the tarapa sauce you use at your stall?"<br/>
"Yes, it meshes really well with Chitto."<br/>
"I see. I often add myam to Chitto, but tarapa is a surprise to me."<br/>
"It would be too sour to add tarapa directly. It won’t taste too bad either way, but I recommend adding in diced aria to make it sweeter."<br/>
The cooking was done as I was explaining to Neil.<br/>
The "Kiba sauté- Arrabbiata style" was done.<br/>
"Please have a taste. I think this is as good as Chitto kiba."<br/>
Neil picked up the spoon with a serious face.<br/>
He then bit into the loin meat covered in red sauce… and then covered his mouth with an "Ahh."<br/>
"W-What is it?"<br/>
"I can’t… stop myself from smiling."<br/>
"That makes me glad."<br/>
I couldn’t help grinning.<br/>
There weren’t any Semu nearby, so there shouldn’t be any problem with showing his emotions.<br/>
"This is too shameful. Ah… It tastes really good."<br/>
Neil twitched the corner of his lips worriedly as he ate the entire dish. He managed to keep a straight face, but his hasty way of eating showed how satisfied he was.<br/>
"Yes, the taste is impeccable. It will definitely be as popular as the previous menu."<br/>
Neil put the plate he cleaned out back on the counter while saying that.<br/>
He then looked at me with his light brown eyes a little worryingly.<br/>
"But there is only one dish…? I requested for the dish to be alternated every day because I couldn’t choose between the two dishes you presented…"<br/>
"Yes, it’s a rare chance, so I was thinking of preparing two dishes too. But the new soup dish I’m researching still isn’t ready."<br/>
I made Arrabbiata style soup with the same method too… But, compared to the vegetable stew I made before, I felt something was missing in this soup.<br/>
The main ingredient of grilled meat was the meat. The tarapa and Chitto meshed perfectly as a sauce that brought out the taste. But when they were made into soup, something seemed to be missing. Just kiba stock, tarapa sauce, and Tau sauce alone weren’t enough to complement the spiciness of the Chitto.<br/>
"Erm, you make the pickled Chitto by marinating it with salted maru, correct? So there is seafood inside, and its taste plays a huge part in making Chitto hotpot"<br/>
This wasn’t common sense, but the conclusion I came to from my memory of eating kimchi hotpot and Italian cuisine.<br/>
Even if it wasn’t seafood, adding Consommé or Bouillon would work too… In short, I felt troubled by the absence of the taste of ‘stock’.<br/>
<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Consomm%C3%A9<br/>
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bouillon_(broth)<br/>
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stock_(food) ><br/>
For example, I could get thick stock by boiling kiba bones and use them. I could also cook several vegetables into vegetable stew too.<br/>
But that would take a lot of time and effort, and the ingredients would cost a lot too. The time limit was an hour, and the price would be two red copper plates for one dish. It was unrealistic to cook it that way under such constraints.<br/>
"Your soup is popular with my customers. They will complain if there isn’t any soup dish to replace it."<br/>
Neil looked at me with sincere eyes and continued:<br/>
"Asuta, I have no complaints about the meat dish earlier. Can you alternate between this meat dish and the pickled Chitto soup?"<br/>
"Ahh, well… To be frank, I need to review the cost price."<br/>
"Cost price? But why?"<br/>
"You see, the Forest’s Edge settlement has adjusted the selling price of fresh kiba meat. It was too cheap in the past, so it has been increased to a reasonable amount. But it is still cheaper than karon meat."<br/>
When he heard my answer, Neil nodded quietly:<br/>
"That’s true. When I heard that you wanted to use pickled Chitto in your dish, I was worried whether you would be able to make any profit at all. Asuta, can you tell me how much are your profits now…? I won’t pry if you are not comfortable with sharing."<br/>
"It’s fine. Right now… I earn nine red copper plates for every 30 portions of Chitto hotpot."<br/>
It might sound staggering, but the price of the kiba I bought from the other houses increased by 85 percent. Neil also widened his eyes in surprise.<br/>
"60 red copper plates worth of cooking make you a profit of nine red copper plates?"<br/>
"Yes. When the meat was cheap, I could earn 30 red copper plates. I don’t really mind this, but I’m still running a business here."<br/>
But the one who caused the price to increase was myself. This situation was a result of me relying too much on the cheap fresh meat.<br/>
On top of that, I was busy with work back then and didn’t have time to research my cooking. My only choice back then was to create this dish by taking inspiration from the kimchi hotpot and kimchi pork.<br/>
"But I know that now. I will continue to research my cooking, and before I come up with a new dish that you find satisfactory, I will continue supplying Chitto hotpot like before."<br/>
"But Asuta, your profits will…"<br/>
"If the customers become unhappy because of this matter and it leaves a bad impression of kiba dish on them, that would be similar to putting the cart before the horse. I think this is the best choice right now. I just need to do my best and present a dish that others will like."<br/>
I then added:<br/>
"However, the high cost of the Chitto hotpot is due to me buying pickled Chitto from Neil and using it in my cooking. If Neil makes and sells the Chitto hotpot, you can make a substantial profit, correct?"<br/>
By the way, Neil should be selling the kiba dishes to his customers at a profitable price now. If he took part in the cooking process, he could add the profit I was making on top of his current profits.<br/>
But Neil lowered his gaze sadly and shook his head.<br/>
"I’m confident of my culinary skills too, but I’m not sure that I can cook a dish as delicious as Asuta. If my cooking isn’t as good as Asuta, it will just make the customer’s unhappy."<br/>
"Is that so… that’s a shame."<br/>
"But Asuta, does that mean I can buy kiba from you?"<br/>
"Huh? Yes, of course."<br/>
My heart skipped a beat.<br/>
Neil’s eyes of regret were suddenly filled with lights of expectations.<br/>
"Then I want to buy some kiba. Making the same dishes as Asuta will make my flaws more prominent, so I want to cook something original for my customers."<br/>
Neil smiled after saying that:<br/>
"And I want to eat kiba too. Why should I serve it to my customers and only eat kimyusu and karon meat myself? I have been thinking about that recently…"<br/>
"Will you really buy kiba?"<br/>
"Yes, although I won’t be buying too much… it won’t be more expensive than karon meat, right?"<br/>
"O-Okay! Right now, I’m benchmarking the price against the karon meat sold in town. When this business gets on track, we might review the price again…"<br/>
"I’m really lucky to buy kiba while it is still cheap then."<br/>
Neil made a gang sign with his fingers.<br/>
It was the gang sign the Semu people often made.<br/>
"Please sell me fresh kiba meat. I would like ten portions every day for now."<br/>
Ten portions in the inn were about 2.5 kg.<br/>
The price was equivalent to karon meat, so there was a profit of ten red copper plates.<br/>
But there was finally someone who was willing to procure fresh kiba meat. I looked back at Ai Fa unconsciously.<br/>
Ai Fa remained expressionless, but she squinted her eyes happily as she looked back at me.<br/>
"Thank you very much, Neil. I’m really, really grateful."<br/>
"I’m glad too. The flavor of the kiba is different from kimyusu and karon meat, and more people will like it with each passing day."<br/>
After saying that, Neil suddenly said: "Excuse me." and turned around.<br/>
He disappeared into the food store and then returned a moment later with a jar and a large cloth bundle.<br/>
"This is the salted maru used to make pickled Chitto."<br/>
Neil said as he placed the jar on the counter and opened the lid.<br/>
I looked inside curiously and found it half-filled with small white translucent objects.<br/>
I couldn’t really tell the shapes. It was thin and about 1 cm in length, and was something like dried and salted krill.<br/>
"This can be caught in the western territories and isn’t a rare ingredient. Shops that sell myam and rock salt will basically sell this too. One jar costs around two red copper plates."<br/>
"I see! So this is actually a snack that goes along with wine."<br/>
This was like the equivalent of pepper squid. It probably wasn’t suited to be mixed with tarapa sauce directly. A precious marine ingredient that could be eaten in Genos which wasn’t near the ocean.<br/>
"Thank you very much. I plan to buy some today and see what food I can cook with it. And this bundle is…?"<br/>
"This is curd. A caravan from Semu came this morning, and I bought some as promised."<br/>
"Ah, it’s cheese! And a lot of it too."<br/>
"Yes, I bought five pieces. I will let you have this one, Asuta."<br/>
The Wu clan wanted to buy some too. This one was about 400 to 500 g so I could split it cleanly in half.<br/>
I turned to glance at Ai Fa, and she suppressed a smile on her lips and glared at me.<br/>
Ai Fa really liked hamburg steak with Camembert-like cheese on top. Even though Ai Fa wasn’t a Semu, I was fine with it as long as she was happy.<br/>
"Thank you very much! The piece I bought previously is almost finished, this is a big help."<br/>
"I’m glad that you like them… You must be even happier about selling fresh kiba, Asuta."<br/>
Neil said with a hint of a smile on his lips.<br/>
"Asuta who is a denizen of Forest’s Edge likes Semu curd; I’m a westerner and love kiba. This might be a trivial conversation in an indistinct shop, but I think it is very meaningful. Please maintain a cordial relationship with me in the future too, Asuta."<br/>
After finishing the job at the 《Cryptic Venerable Inn》, we headed to the 《Big Tree of the South Inn》 next.<br/>
The 《Cryptic Venerable Inn》 was located rather far from the stone-paved street and was in the middle of the residential zone. So we had to make our way through a narrow alley.<br/>
Not much time had passed since noon. Most of the people were working in the shops along the street or in the fields to the south, so there weren’t many pedestrians.<br/>
I shouldn’t act too excited in front of the moody Vena Wu, but I couldn’t help whispering to Ai Fa: "We got plenty of great news today. The new dish was well received, we bought cheese, and someone is willing to buy fresh kiba. This is perfect."<br/>
"That’s great. But you still need to make another dish to be sold at that inn, correct?"<br/>
"Yes, but we have Gilulu now, so the journey to and fro Post Station Town is shortened. I can delegate the preparation jobs to Leina Wu and the others, so I have more time now. I will figure something out."<br/>
"… You will just keep feeding me dishes made from that red berry though."<br/>
"No, like I said, Ai Fa’s portion will be less spicy."<br/>
"I’m a little peeved that you did that."<br/>
Ai Fa pouted from an angle that Shin Wu and the others couldn’t see.<br/>
"Don’t pout. I will make you some hamburg steak with cheese for taste testing too."<br/>
"… You think that will make me happy?"<br/>
"Ah, you look blissful when eating hamburg steak."<br/>
I was kicked.<br/>
I need to restrain myself from going overboard.<br/>
Anyway, Neil is not an ordinary person. He lives in the western kingdom, but his mindset is closer to the people from the east. Not many people will accept kiba that easily though.<br/>
But this was still a meaningful step.<br/>
Naudiz from the 《Big Tree of the South Inn》 might be thinking about cooking kiba himself, and I had a chance to work with the 《West Wind Inn》 too. If I could convince Milano Mast, I would be able to sell kiba dishes in the 《Kimyusu’s Tail Inn》.<br/>
Things felt stagnant just a few days ago, but there had been so much progress in just one day. It was at times like this that I needed to be cautious and take things slow and steady… With that in mind, my strides turned lighter.<br/>
This is the fourth day of the fourth contract; there are still six days before the contract is up. Why don’t I rest for two days to research my cooking?<br/>
I could only think about all this after on a day off after twenty odd days. Was I a workaholic?<br/>
I thought quietly when Ai Fa suddenly grabbed my right arm. Vena Wu and the others behind us also stopped because of that.<br/>
Before I could ask her the reason, someone appeared on the path we were heading down.<br/>
"Asuta, what coincidence. What you do in a place like this?"<br/>
He spoke Western a little awkwardly.<br/>
That person pulled back his hood, showing his long brown hair and a smiling dark face. He was Sangjura who visited our stall yesterday.<br/>
"Ah, hello. What a coincidence, we are heading back after finishing our work."<br/>
"Work, place like this?"<br/>
Sangjura approached us slowly.<br/>
Ai Fa was very wary for some reason, but Sanjura was smiling gently like yesterday.<br/>
"That’s right. I’m actually catering for an inn. I still need to rush to another inn later."<br/>
"Inn. Could it be…《Cryptic Venerable Inn》?"<br/>
"Huh? Yes, it’s the 《Cryptic Venerable Inn》."<br/>
"As I suspect. That inn, serve kiba dishes."<br/>
He continued smiling as he squinted his light colored eyes.<br/>
What a charming smile.<br/>
"Ah, are you lodging in the《Cryptic Venerable Inn》, Sangjura?"<br/>
"Yes. I born in west but like eastern cuisine. So I always choose, inn catered for easterners."<br/>
Aside from how he didn’t conceal his emotions, Sangjura looked just like a Semu. It was only natural for him to lodge in 《Cryptic Venerable Inn》.<br/>
A mixed-blood between the east and the west, huh. He probably has a complicated family history too.<br/>
I wasn’t that wary of Sangjura, but there was a strange air about him. He felt a little unnatural… and was similar to Shumimaru’s charm and Kamyua Yost’s suspiciousness in a sense. I was drawn to him for some reason.<br/>
Maybe it’s because he shows his emotions despite being a Semu.<br/>
In any case, I felt good will towards him.<br/>
So I bid him farewell with a smile:<br/>
"Alright then, I still have work to attend to, may we meet again…"<br/>
"Wait. Don’t move, Asuta"<br/>
Ai Fa pulled my arm again.<br/>
I turned back and was shocked. The rage of a hunter was burning in Ai Fa’s blue eyes.<br/>
"W-What’s the matter? He didn’t do anything, right?!"<br/>
"It has nothing to do with this man. Someone is watching us."<br/>
Ai Fa said in a soft voice.<br/>
"It’s different from yesterday, this gaze is like poison needles. There isn’t anyone around here; I might be able to trace it back. Pretend to know nothing and don’t panic."<br/>
I swept the place with my eyes.<br/>
There weren’t signs of anyone else here, much lest a presence.<br/>
Sangjura tilted his head a quizzingly.<br/>
"What is it? I, don’t sense anything."<br/>
After saying crudely: "Sorry, please don’t talk for now.", Ai Fa looked at Shin Wu.<br/>
Shin Wu nodded and walked calmly to Ai Fa’s side.<br/>
"How is it? Did you notice?"<br/>
"Yes, faintly. But… this feels like a hunter who is masking his presence."<br/>
"Yes. The townsfolk can’t hide themselves so well… Anyway, the presence is ahead of us, to the right."<br/>
Ai Fa glanced at Sangjura and then whispered to Shin Wu:<br/>
"I want to stay here to protect Asuta and the eldest daughter of the Wu clan. Can you go if we find the source? It might be a little dangerous."<br/>
"Understood. To the right… in front of us. Correct? Isn’t that between those two houses?"<br/>
"Maybe. Let’s walk on ahead slowly."<br/>
Ai Fa looked towards Sangjura after saying that.<br/>
"Easterner… I have a favor to ask."<br/>
"Okay, do what?"<br/>
"I hope you can leave immediately, if you have nothing to do with the presence over there."<br/>
Sangjura furrowed his brows puzzledly.<br/>
"I don’t understand. But Asuta, you have job later? Then, I go."<br/>
"Yes, sorry about that. I hope you won’t mind."<br/>
I couldn’t grasp the situation myself, so I just apologized vaguely.<br/>
Sangjura showed me a refreshing smile before putting on his hood again.<br/>
"Tomorrow, I go your stall. I eat Asuta food just now."<br/>
"Ah, is that so? Thank you for your patronage."<br/>
"You welcome. Tomorrow I come early."<br/>
Sangjura made a conscious effort to not go near Ai Fa, as he headed down the way we came from— towards the 《Cryptic Venerable Inn》.<br/>
"Alright, let’s go. Asuta and eldest daughter of the Wu clan, continue walking and pretend to not know anything, and slowly go around to my left. Just walk down to the fork road there. Don’t do anything unnatural."<br/>
Ai Fa half closed her hunter’s eyes and led the way.<br/>
Aside from her dangerous gaze, her movements were no different from usual.<br/>
Was someone really watching us?<br/>
Just what is going on here? Things have been strange since yesterday’s morning. If Pyschkurewuss is involved, his men should only be making their moves after the conference…<br/>
My heart started to race.<br/>
I moved my legs that were growing stiff and slowly drifted towards Ai Fa’s left.<br/>
We were less than 5 meters from the road leading to the right. When I noticed, Shin Wu was already on Ai Fa’s right, while Vena Wu was right behind me.<br/>
The place was still barren. We will reach the streets in a few more minutes, and the surroundings were still as quiet as a ghost town.<br/>
This wasn’t a well-to-do residential area. The closely packed houses were built mostly with wood, which wasn’t too different from the Forest’s Edge settlement. When we were almost at the alley between two houses, Shin Wu suddenly jumped.<br/>
Someone who was walking normally disappeared suddenly from my sights.<br/>
Shin Wu dashed into the depths of the alley, with his hunter’s cape fluttering behind him.<br/>
I yelled "Ahh!" on reflex.<br/>
A pebble flew towards Shin Wu from the shadow of a house.<br/>
But Shin Wu continued  to run at the same speed after tilting his head to evade that attack.<br/>
Ai Fa pulled out her saber with a flash to deflect the pebble flying our way.<br/>
At the same time, a petite figure jumped out from the shadow of the house.<br/>
The figure sprinted down the road with his back to Shin Wu.<br/>
It was a child-like figure that was wearing a leather cape that differed from a kiba cape.<br/>
"Wait!"<br/>
Shin Wu shouted as he grabbed the shoulders of that mysterious person.<br/>
In that instant, Shin Wu’s body suddenly flew up into the air.<br/>
I couldn’t tell what happened.<br/>
When I realized it, Shin Wu’s body had spun in the air and fell down with his back to the ground.<br/>
Shin Wu groaned and the assailant turned towards us.<br/>
An unfamiliar face.<br/>
He wore his hood deep like a Semu.<br/>
His stature was short, shorter than Ai Fa and Shin Wu.<br/>
Under his yellow leopard-spotted cape were plain clothes.<br/>
His skin color… was ivory? He looked tanned and a little dirty, so I wasn’t sure. However, he definitely wasn’t a Semu or a Jaguar.<br/>
The small assailant looked at the groaning Shin Wu on the ground and us who were standing 5 to 6 meters away.<br/>
He then slowly reached for the weapon by his waist.<br/>
On his child-like and girlish waist was a crescent-shaped scimitar.<br/>
"Stop!"<br/>
Ai Fa roared shrilly.<br/>
"You can’t draw your blade in town! Why are you targeting us!?"<br/>
Ai Fa yelled as she braced her sheathed blade.<br/>
She then said quietly to us with her eyes locked onto the assailant: "Stay behind me."<br/>
The assailant held the hilt of the scimitar as he stared at us.<br/>
Shin Wu struggled to get up beside his feet.<br/>
The assailant then kicked Shin Wu’s face.<br/>
Blood splattered, and Shin Wu collapsed again.<br/>
"I told you to stop! You dare lay your hands on a denizen of Forest’s Edge? I will be your opponent!"<br/>
That wasn’t something I expected Ai Fa to say.<br/>
But Ai Fa probably thought that she couldn’t save Shin Wu if she didn’t say that much. With this distance, no matter how fast Ai Fa was, she couldn’t beat the swing of the assailant’s blade.<br/>
The assailant swayed his head a little hesitantly.<br/>
Should he turn and run, or stab the enemy by his feet to take down one enemy? That was probably what he was thinking about.<br/>
After a short silence in this dangerous atmosphere, the assailant made the third choice.<br/>
He charged towards Ai Fa.<br/>
"Get down!"<br/>
After shouting at us, Ai Fa ducked down.<br/>
The assailant covered several meters in an instant, drew his scimitar, and leapt with a yell… and then swung his blade towards Ai Fa.<br/>
But their blades didn’t touch the other parties’ body.<br/>
A second before they would collide, the assailant vanished.<br/>
I couldn’t understand what was happening before me.<br/>
In the place of the petite assailant who disappeared was a tall cloaked man.<br/>
He was wielding a sheathed blade just like Ai Fa and was facing diagonally from us. It was Sangjura.<br/>
"Butting in, sorry. I was worried, so I came back."<br/>
He said calmly with the sheathed blade in his left hand, as he straightened his slightly crouching body.<br/>
"Hurt, are you? Probably, safe now."<br/>
I sighed in relief and looked to my left.<br/>
Ai Fa was already looking my way.<br/>
The assailant who got attacked from the flank by Sangjura held his left shoulder as he rolled on the ground.<br/>
Sangjura took three steps forwards and stepped on the scimitar rolling on the ground.<br/>
Ai Fa continued bracing her blade warily and said softly: "… Thank you for your help."<br/>
Sangjura looked at the assailant who was writhing in pain and said with a smile: "You are welcome."<br/>
"Maintain peace, responsibility of townsfolk. Hand him, to guards."<br/>
Sangjura then flicked his sword.<br/>
The tip of the sheath hooked the hood of the assailant, revealing his face.<br/>
Bright red filled our sights.<br/>
The assailant’s hair was as red as Lala Wu’s.<br/>
Sangjura said quietly: "Please, no struggle. Bandit, are you?"<br/>
The assailant who was lying prone got up with his hand on his left shoulder.<br/>
"Don’t be absurd! You are calling me a bandit!?"<br/>
His voice sounded more childlike than I expected.<br/>
But his face was scary.<br/>
His messy flame-like hair hung over his cheeks, and yellowish feral light shone out from his bangs.<br/>
His brows were furrowed from rage, and he bared his fangs like a carnivorous feline. I couldn’t imagine how he actually looked because of how twisted his face was from rage.<br/>
"Damn Semu… If you dare treat me like a bandit, I will kill you…"<br/>
"Drawing blade in town, attacking innocent townsfolk. If not bandit, then what?"<br/>
Sangjura replied to the youth calmly… then observed this assailant who was a far cry from being calm.<br/>
"But your attire… Instead of bandit, like Marsala hunter."<br/>
Ai Fa commented quietly: "Hunter?"<br/>
The enraged youth glared at Ai Fa.<br/>
"Filthy denizens of Forest’s Edge… I will never forgive you."<br/>
"What are you talking about. If you have any grudge, let me hear it. If you bare your blade at me, I can only respond in kind."<br/>
The youth swung his right arm and yelled: "Shut up!"<br/>
A silver flash cut through the air. Ai Fa and Sangjura parried his thrown daggers at the same time with their sheaths.<br/>
The daggers fell harmlessly by their feet.<br/>
Their reaction was incredibly fast.<br/>
However, the youth achieved his goal.<br/>
Sangjura left a gap when he adjusted his posture to swing his blade, and that youth snatched the scimitar from under his feet.<br/>
That youth was as nimble as a beast.<br/>
"I will definitely get my revenge! I swear on my name of Geta, son of Red Beard Goram!"<br/>
"What?"<br/>
The youth had already turned and left when Ai Fa said that.<br/>
The next moment Sangjura who wanted to give chase kept his sheathed sword with a sigh.<br/>
"Fast, he run. I can’t catch."<br/>
Ai Fa clicked her tongue and kept her sheathed blade too.<br/>
She could probably catch up, but she couldn’t just leave us behind. That youth in a leopard-patterned cape disappeared between the buildings in no time.<br/>
"Red beard Goram… Ai Fa, isn’t that the bandit boss that was mentioned yesterday?"<br/>
The boss of the "Red Beard Gang", Goram… Kamyua Yost talked about him before.<br/>
In order to find his significant other and child, Kamyua left Genos together with a few hunters of Forest’s Edge.<br/>
"What’s going on here? Did Kamyua just miss them? W-What should we do now…"<br/>
"Don’t get flustered. Tend to Shin Wu’s injury first."<br/>
Ai Fa glared at me.<br/>
"So is bandit after all. Broad daylight, in town. Rare."<br/>
Sangjura smiled leisurely.<br/>
He wasn’t fazed at all; I felt the need to change my first impression of him being the type to not get into trouble.<br/>
"But I feel, his shoulder blade, fracture. In short time, won’t do crime. Best, leave to guards."<br/>
"… Yes, thank you."<br/>
I answered with a sigh. We couldn’t hand him over to the guards.<br/>
Kamyua Yost was searching for the wife and child of Red Beard Goram, they were important witnesses. And the town patrol in the Post Station Town seemed to be members of the Towns Guards commanded by Pyschkurewuss’ brother. We had to find that youth before the guards did.<br/>
He can’t forgive the denizens of Forest’s Edge because his father was executed on trumped up charges? Then… the only option is to clear up the truth.<br/>
If that youth still hates the denizens of Forest’s Edge… it would be troubling.<br/>
I suppressed my urge to sigh over this complicated matter.<br/>
This was definitely a trial the Forest’s Edge had to go through. The wrongdoings of Zattsu Tsun, and the denizens who didn’t stop him. Not all the townsfolk thought that the slate was wiped clean when Zattsu Tsun was executed.<br/>
A child younger than me, huh; he actually hates us so much… This isn’t normal.<br/>
Please appear before us again. Please have a talk with the new tribal chiefs… I murmured in my heart as I looked at the street where the red-haired youth fled.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
4<br/>
"Shin Wu! What happened to you!"<br/>
After finishing our work, we linked up with the group that stayed with the stall. Lala Wu rushed to the pale-faced Shin Wu immediately.<br/>
Shin Wu had a bruise under his right eye and his lips were chapped and bleeding. He answered expressionlessly: "I was careless."<br/>
"What do you mean by careless!? Were you assaulted!?"<br/>
"Don’t be so loud. You will frighten the town folks."<br/>
Shin Wu remained calm.<br/>
Lala Wu leaned onto Shin Wu’s chest and glared at Ai Fa.<br/>
"How did Shin Wu get wounded even with Ai Fa around!? Isn’t Ai Fa able to deal easily with any opponents!?"<br/>
"That’s enough. Ai Fa performed her task. I failed at mine, so it’s my incompetence at fault; Ai Fa is not to be blamed."<br/>
Ai Fa remained silent.<br/>
Ai Fa was probably wary of Sangjura, that’s why she didn’t leave Vena Wu and me alone.<br/>
But if she said that, it would be as good as saying Shin Wu wasn’t capable of stopping Sangjura. So Ai Fa didn’t say anything until the end<br/>
Shin Wu glanced at Ai Fa and then grabbed Lala Wu’s shoulders.<br/>
"Tis but a scratch. I will continue to train so I can do my job properly."<br/>
"But…!"<br/>
"Annoying. What’s the use of talking about all that? Instead of getting mad, won’t you be cuter if you cry?"<br/>
"You are the annoying one!"<br/>
Lala Wu turned towards Ludo Wu, with watery eyes.<br/>
"What, so you really are crying. Well… Shin Wu didn’t do too great just now too. At a time like this, you should tell her that you’re sorry for making her worry and then give her a hug."<br/>
Shin Wu didn’t say anything and started to blush.<br/>
And, of course, Lala Wu’s face started turning red, and her mouth started gaping because she was too angry.<br/>
Ludo Wu started giggling and then showed a sharp gaze in his eyes.<br/>
"It’s fine, Asuta and Vena-nee are still alive and kicking. Something must have happened for Shin Wu to become like this. Let’s discuss the details on the way back, Ai Fa."<br/>
"Yes, I don’t want others to hear us."<br/>
"Okay, let’s hurry back to Forest’s Edge…"<br/>
Before Ludo Wu could finish, a group of cloak men walked over.<br/>
And, of course, they were the Silver Vase.<br/>
The person walking at their fore stood before me and Vena Wu and pulled back his hood. Vena Wu almost averted her face, but steeled herself and glared at them with angry eyes instead.<br/>
"Asuta, Vena Wu, late I am, sorry. Bid farewell, I come."<br/>
"Thank you, Shumimaru. I’m glad to have met you."<br/>
My feelings were a mixture of anxiousness and relief, but I still answered him with a smile.<br/>
Ludo Wu scratched his blonde hair and said: "Ahh, I forgot about you guys."<br/>
"What a hectic day. But… If we stay here, people might call the guards on us?"<br/>
Things weren’t that serious, but we were already very prominent. Nine denizens of Forest’s Edge, ten easterners, two Totos and a wagon, a massive group. Even though the stone-paved road was ten meters wide, we were still obstructing normal traffic.<br/>
"Why don’t we go around the back of that building? The road leading back to Forest’s Edge has an open space nearby."<br/>
Everyone accepted my proposal unquestioningly and then started moving.<br/>
I took the reins from Shela Wu and then headed south along the street.<br/>
Shela Wu who had just moved to the back took out something from the wagon and came to me again:<br/>
"Asuta, I handed the jerky to the southerners. The remunerations are safekept together with the earnings from the stall."<br/>
"Ahh, thank you. Erm… The special jerky I prepared…"<br/>
"They accepted it happily."<br/>
Shela Wu smiled brightly… and showed a brilliant smile.<br/>
"Their leader Balan told me to hold on to this."<br/>
"Huh? What is it…?"<br/>
"It looks like fruit wine. Seems to be expensive."<br/>
Shela Wu opened the bundle, and there was a rarely seen bottle in it.<br/>
It wasn’t the fruit wine that the denizens of Forest’s Edge frequently bought for one red copper plate. These two were like the bottle Kamuyua Yost gifted me in the past and contained smooth and high-quality wine.<br/>
"They said… gifting something like this isn’t a custom in Genos or Jaguar. But since Asuta gave them a present too, they will call it even."<br/>
The image of Pops Balan’s angry yelling face appeared before my eyes.<br/>
"He also said that he will come back to Genos after a year at most and to not get into any trouble."<br/>
"… I understand, thank you."<br/>
Shela Wu nodded and then went to the back to keep the fruit wine.<br/>
Ai Fa then leaned in.<br/>
"Asuta, are you crying?"<br/>
"Who’s crying, stupid!"<br/>
I was careless and answered her a little too loudly. Ai Fa pouted and said: "Why did you call me stupid?"<br/>
I apologized and then cast my gaze towards Shumimaru who was walking diagonally ahead of me.<br/>
I will be bidding farewell to Pops Balan, Arudas, and Shumimaru today. The emotions in my heart started to well up.<br/>
Who’s crying, stupid…<br/>
I didn’t even know myself who I was calling stupid, and just walked along in a daze.<br/>
We followed the stone-paved path southwards, passed through an alley between two inns, and our field of vision suddenly opened up.<br/>
It was a vast empty space. On the opposite side was the looming forest.<br/>
Buildings to our back and forest to our front. There was a small worn path leading into right into the Forest’s Edge in the woods.<br/>
This was the border between the forest and the Post Station Town.<br/>
Which was also the place where the people opposing and supporting our business gathered.<br/>
Our two groups faced each other here.<br/>
The denizens of Forest’s Edge stood with their backs to the forest, and the easterners had the town behind them. We stood in two rows representing different camps.<br/>
"Thank you, let us taste, delicious food."<br/>
Shumimaru made a gang sign and bowed.<br/>
The people standing on either side of him also pulled their hoods back.<br/>
The only faces I recognized belonged to Shumimaru, the deputy band leader Radajiddo who visited this afternoon, and a young man whose name I didn’t know.<br/>
I think he was the one standing at the left edge of the row.<br/>
After trying a "Kiba burger" sample, he called his brethrens from the caravan over. For my stall, he was the second patron after Tara.<br/>
Shumimaru’s first visit of my stall was on the next day.<br/>
When the Pops was hollering that this meat tasted nasty and was inedible, the Silver Vase visited my stall. Pops’ mates also came over, causing quite a scene.<br/>
That was a month ago.<br/>
And now, Shumimaru walked up to me.<br/>
Ai Fa was between Vena Wu and me.<br/>
But Shumimaru stood before me.<br/>
"Asuta, farewell, late, sorry."<br/>
"No, it’s fine…"<br/>
"Entire day, in city."<br/>
"Huh?"<br/>
"Collect information, about Pyschkurewuss. Investigate, truth, of rumors."<br/>
I was surprised beyond words.<br/>
Shumimaru squinted apologetically.<br/>
"Butt in, sorry. But help Asuta, I want. How dangerous Pyschkurewuss is, want know… But, truth, no find."<br/>
"But… But why, Shumimaru…?"<br/>
"But someone who knows truth, I meet. Help Asuta, that person can. One day, visit 《Cryptic Venerable Inn》, he will."<br/>
A person who knew whether the rumors about Pyschkurewuss were true.<br/>
However, the rumors Shumimaru heard were probably not directly related to the denizens of Forest’s Edge.<br/>
But that didn’t matter anymore. I was just happy that Shumimaru was so worried about me… as well as angry.<br/>
"Shumimaru, why did you do something so dangerous? Aren’t you the one who told me not to go near Pyschkurewuss, Shumimaru?"<br/>
"Why Asuta angry, I understand. But help you, I want."<br/>
Shumimaru lowered his gaze depressedly.<br/>
"Sorry, restrain myself, I can’t."<br/>
I couldn’t bear a grudge against him after seeing how sad his eyes were.<br/>
"I never expect Shumimaru to be so reckless. Even though he looked so steady and calm."<br/>
"Yes. Brethren, say often."<br/>
Contrary to how Shumimaru looked, he was very enthusiastic about chatting.<br/>
I smiled even though I felt like crying.<br/>
"… But, I’m happy that you are so worried about me. Thank you."<br/>
"Welcome. That man… Michael of Turan, be of help, definitely."<br/>
One of the members of Silver Vase who were listening to us quietly walked up to us slowly.<br/>
"Meet that man, you need, denizen of Forest’s Edge. Stars, last night, I read."<br/>
He was an elderly Semu.<br/>
His stature was tall, but his dark face was filled with deep wrinkles, and his neck and arms were covered in veins. He had serene eyes, the kind I imagine Shumimaru would have when he gets old.<br/>
"Denizens of Forest’s Edge, gain power when meet him. And denizens of Forest’s Edge, own path, will find."<br/>
He was the Semu astrologist.<br/>
This was the astrologist who prophesied that the malefic star Zattsu Tsun would fade… He even said that he couldn’t read my star.<br/>
I felt my back stiffened.<br/>
The elderly man kept his face emotionless, and after looking at me for a while, he shifted his gaze towards Ai Fa.<br/>
"You are… star of the cat."<br/>
"What?"<br/>
"Malefic star gone, Forest’s Edge, fate, change, revolution. Three-headed lion awaken, lead, Forest’s Edge, future. Star of three-headed lion, flanked by, star of cat, star of monkey, star of hawk. Future, shining brighter."<br/>
"Sorry, I don’t understand you at all. What’s a cat?"<br/>
"Forest’s Edge, no cats? Eastern kingdom, have. Animal, sacred. "<br/>
I thought she was a cat-like woman too.<br/>
I shifted my gaze back onto Shumimaru.<br/>
"… I understand. I will trust Shumimaru’s judgment. If Micheal of Turan shows up, I will speak with him."<br/>
"Yes, help you, he will."<br/>
Shumimaru sighed in relief.<br/>
He then showed the right hand that was behind his cloak.<br/>
His smooth and dark arms were holding a beautiful bundle.<br/>
"Gift, I have, for Asuta."<br/>
"Oh, what is it?"<br/>
"Wineglass."<br/>
I tilted my head and opened the bundle.<br/>
Inside was a couple of simple transparent cups… the beautiful wine glasses I saw at the Silver Vase’s shop some time ago.<br/>
The wine glasses came in a pair.<br/>
"Ai Fa, it’s for you…"<br/>
I turned back and said.<br/>
Ai Fa also widened her eyes in surprise.<br/>
"Blessing for meeting Asuta, I want give. What to give, I no know… Radajiddo tell, Ai Fa, Asuta, this wine glass, curiously looked."<br/>
That was over twenty days ago. Ai Fa and I visited the Silver Vase’s shop in order to buy the Semu kitchen knife and the necklace that could ward off misfortune.<br/>
Speaking of which, a very tall easterner tended to their shop when Shumimaru wasn’t around.<br/>
"Accept please. Thanks, for Fa house dinner."<br/>
With an unhappy gaze in her eyes, Ai Fa said formally: "… This is too expensive as a return gift for treating you to a meal."<br/>
Shumimaru looked at Ai Fa calmly.<br/>
"Price, no matter. Gift make Asuta and Ai Fa happy, I want. If you happy with rock, I also give rock. Price, no matter."<br/>
"I can’t beat a cunning linguist like you after all."<br/>
Ai Fa replied, and I felt really hyped up.<br/>
I turned to the wagon to fetch my gift for them, and Shela Wu was already handing me that bundle.<br/>
I thanked Shela Wu and then handed it to Shumimaru.<br/>
"Shumimaru, this is a gift from the Fa house for the ‘Silver Vase’. It is jerky made with a special method; please consume within seven days. It’s more tender compared to normal jerky and can be eaten without any preparation."<br/>
Shumimaru squinted happily and accepted the bundle with thanks.<br/>
His gaze alone was a good enough answer for me.<br/>
The nine Semy behind him also lowered their heads.<br/>
Shumimaru handed the bundle to his companion… then stood before Vena Wu.<br/>
"… Vena Wu, much sorry, for two days ago, sudden visit."<br/>
Vena Wu looked at Shumimaru wordlessly.<br/>
Shumimaru looked at Vena Wu with a peaceful face too.<br/>
"Leave Genos, I, tomorrow."<br/>
"…"<br/>
"Half year, back, Genos. Work Genos, one month, back, Semu. That, ‘Silver Vase’, way of life."<br/>
"…"<br/>
"Then, half year, rest home. Then, one year, journey. Continue, until old, can’t travel. Journey, we love. Plainsmen, we are, life is journey."<br/>
Vena Wu muttered softly: "… You spend more time traveling than at home… I think that’s a nice way of living too… I yearn for the world outside of Forest’s Edge and am envious of such a life… But, I’m… still a denizen of Forest’s Edge…"<br/>
Vena Wu didn’t show any expression on her face.<br/>
But that didn’t mean there weren’t any ripples in her heart; she was probably working hard to not show her wavering feelings.<br/>
"I can’t abandon my family… The souls of the denizens of Forest’s Edge must return to the mother forest…"<br/>
Shumimaru nodded gently as he gazed into Vena Wu’s eyes.<br/>
"Right way to think, that is. But… think two days, I. Make up mind, I did."<br/>
"…"<br/>
Shumimaru said with conviction: "I, to Vena Wu, propose marriage."<br/>
Lala Wu and I held our breaths…<br/>
Vena Wu shook her head gently.<br/>
"Didn’t you hear what I said…?"<br/>
"I hear."<br/>
"… You want me to abandon the Forest’s Edge and my family…?"<br/>
"No."<br/>
"Then, you want to give up on the traveling you love…?"<br/>
"No."<br/>
"Then what do you want…? I don’t understand what you are saying…"<br/>
"Give up work in caravan, I can’t. But in Semu, no family. For me, nine brethrens of ‘Silver Vase’, my everything."<br/>
Shumimaru said calmly:<br/>
"So, abandon Semu, become denizen of Forest’s Edge, I will. As… denizen of Forest’s Edge, continue work in ‘Silver Vase’."<br/>
Emotions appeared on Vena Wu’s face for the first time.<br/>
She looked at Shumimaru with her light colored eyes, as if she was seeing something she couldn’t believe.<br/>
"But… Abandoning Semu means disavowing your god… Your companions will no longer be your brethrens…?"<br/>
"Yes. But forgive me, everyone did. Continue work, they allow. Work as friend, not brethren."<br/>
"… Things won’t be so easy…"<br/>
Vena Wu hugged herself as if she was feeling cold.<br/>
Shumimaru looked at Vena Wu calmly as he always did.<br/>
"Only, bad thing, two. I, be westerner, ‘Silver Vase’, no go Mahildra. I, no stay Semu. But… brethren say, fine. No brethren, still friend."<br/>
"But…"<br/>
"Give up, business in Mahildra. Procure goods, my brethrens, in Semu. Radajiddo… said. Radajiddo, take over, bandleader. I, as westerner, and denizen of Forest’s Edge, work in ‘Silver Vase’."<br/>
"…"<br/>
"People from plains, soul, return to plains. I, to Forest’s Edge, offer soul. Give up, plains, my home, painful. But, nine friends, and Vena Wu, I blissful."<br/>
Shumimaru’s voice was as calm as his eyes.<br/>
But he tried his best to express himself with his limited grasp of the western language.<br/>
"Like I explain, leave home, one year, rest home, half year. But Semu, far. Semu, Genos, come and go, two months each. Aside from journey, away from home, about 8 months. Also, do work Genos, two months. If Genos is home, only leave, for half year. Leave Forest’s Edge, six months, rest of time, I want, be with Vena Wu."<br/>
"But… You can’t hunt kiba, right…?"<br/>
"Cannot. But, I travel western kingdom. Get knowledge, all kinds. Get weapons, all kinds. Give Forest’s Edge, hunt kiba, new techniques. What I can do, that is."<br/>
"… My father is the tribal chief of Forest’s Edge, you know…? He will never allow a foreigner to marry into the family…"<br/>
"Convince Donda Wu, I will. Make Vena Wu happy, I swear. Half year, when I back Genos, show power, to him."<br/>
Shumimaru took off the accessories on his hand calmly as he spoke.<br/>
It was a silver bangle with small pink stones embedded in it.<br/>
"Vena Wu, peace be with you. Accept my gift, will you?"<br/>
"I…"<br/>
She stopped mid-sentence.<br/>
After a moment of silence, Vena Wu looked up into Shumimaru’s eyes.<br/>
"… I don’t know how to interact with an unfathomable person like you…"<br/>
Shumimaru tilted his head quizzingly.<br/>
And then…<br/>
He suddenly smiled:<br/>
"Become denizen of Forest’s Edge, I work hard, show feelings. Embarrassing. But, necessary, I think."<br/>
He had a pure, warm smile that was just like Sangjura’s.<br/>
Vena Wu furrowed her brows troublingly.<br/>
"I trouble, few days… I trouble, one month. Worry I am, when Vena Wu injured. I know. Vena Wu, I need. Vena Wu, I want to be with."<br/>
"But…"<br/>
"Vena Wu, worry for me, I happy. Half year, before I back Genos, can you consider? Half year, if reply, I happy."<br/>
Shumimaru reached out his hands timidly and took Vena Wu’s hand.<br/>
He put the silver bangle in Vena Wu’s hand.<br/>
"This half year, I swear, think of Vena Wu, nightly. I love… Vena Wu."<br/>
Vena Wu held that bangle tightly and lowered her head. I couldn’t see her facial expressions.<br/>
After Shumimaru looked at her one last time, he turned to me again.<br/>
He was still smiling gently as usual.<br/>
"Well then, back, we go. Next meet, half year after. Asuta, Vena Wu, Ai Fa, Ludo Wu… and friends names I no learn yet, peace be with all you. May Forest’s Edge, bright future."<br/>
"Yes, take care… I look forward to seeing you again."<br/>
Shumimaru nodded and turned around.<br/>
His brethrens did a simple bow and then turned too.<br/>
I silently watched the backs of ten tall and cloaked easterners.<br/>
This was goodbye.<br/>
No matter how short half a year was, we wouldn’t be able to meet again until that time passes.<br/>
It had been two months since I came here.<br/>
In half a year, I might see them again.<br/>
I might meet Pops Balan and company a year later too.<br/>
However, it wouldn’t be a surprise if I just disappeared for good.<br/>
Anyone could die anytime, even me, but I still couldn’t break myself free from the feelings of unease.<br/>
This could be goodbye for forever.<br/>
I wouldn’t be able to hear that gentle voice and those warm eyes.<br/>
Could I bear witness to Shumimaru and Vena Wu’s future?<br/>
My chest started hurting as if it was being crushed.<br/>
Ai Fa asked: "… Asuta, are you crying?"<br/>
I answered: "Who’s crying, stupid."<br/>
Ai Fa didn’t respond.<br/>
I hoped she would brush the corners of my eyes gently, but she just ruffled my hair violently.<br/>
And so, after meeting all kinds of people, the Green month where I bid farewell to all kinds of people ended.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
