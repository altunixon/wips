I cut the mushrooms into thin slices, added a small portion of soy sauce and salt, and heated them up a bit. That’s it for the additional flavoring. It’ll be done once it’s simmered enough. I gave it a taste test and found that the dashi flavored by the katsuobushi and mushrooms really came out well. This is definitely tasty!<br/>
I had Verse taste it as well.<br/>
"Great! This stuff’s amazin! It’s such a simple dish, but it has a really refined flavor. No, it’s because it’s simple that it works!"<br/>
The boiled eggs are done as well, so I’ll proceed with making the tartar sauce. I minced the mock-onions I found in the fridge earlier, mashed the boiled eggs, and added mayonnaise, salt and pepper to complete the sauce.<br/>
"Please let me try some as well! …Ah, this sauce is also quite delicious too."<br/>
It looks like Verse is already captive to the bewitching magic of mayonnaise. Yep. It’s tasty alright.<br/>
"You served us rice yesterday, right?"<br/>
"How long will it take you to cook your dishes? Rice is best-served piping hot after all. I’ve washed the grains and soaked them in water already."<br/>
"You really get it, sir. Let’s see. I’ll need an hour more I guess."<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
"I’ll cook it with that in mind then."<br/>
I’ll make some salad next.<br/>
"I’m thinking of making some salad. Do you have any vegetables you can recommend?"<br/>
"Let’s see, if it’s salad, then this, this and this should be good."<br/>
Some greens, mock-onions and something resembling tomatoes huh. To think there were tomatoes available… I missed it completely.<br/>
I cut the leafy greens and the tomato-look-alikes into small portions along with the mock-onions. I plated the mixture into a large bowl.<br/>
I’ll make enough for Verse’s family as well. I’ll let it chill inside the magic fridge for a while.<br/>
Next would be the white liver sashimi.<br/>
I cut the liver into thin slices and plated them on a dish. I’ll make portions for Verse’s family too.<br/>
Oh right. There’s a risk of contracting things like viruses and parasites if one eats raw liver.<br/>
(Are there any viruses or parasites present in this liver?)<br/>
「Such elements are not present.」<br/>
(I see. Please do a preliminary check every time I make food that needs to be eaten raw.)<br/>
「Acknowledged.」<br/>
I’ll serve the sashimi along with the oil similar to sesame oil I found in Tarus-san’s shop paired with some salt and grated garlic.<br/>
Let me try some then. Tasty! I really think liver is best served like this after all.<br/>
"Oi, you eating that stuff raw!?"<br/>
"It’s fresh so there’s no problem, I think? Well, it certainly can’t be eaten by people weak to raw stuff. Have a taste."<br/>
"Delish! To think there’s this way of preparing a dish as well…"<br/>
"Well, I think it’s this tasty because we used white liver. Normal liver won’t taste as good."<br/>
I’ll chill these inside the fridge as well.<br/>
I’ll start with the fried food now. I’ll make a good amount of eggwash since I’ll be using it on the karaage as well. The white flour inside the bowl looked quite dazzling. I mixed in some eggwash and breadcrumbs. I had Verse help out as well.<br/>
I put in the karaage meat with flour and egg mixture and coated them thoroughly. I actually preferred using potato starch, but it’s not available, so it can’t be helped.<br/>
"Are you going to roast these? I just can’t imagine how this dish is going to turn out?"<br/>
"I’ll fry them in oil. Are you not familiar with this cooking method?"<br/>
"Frying? I did hear some countries made use of that kind of cooking method, but we don’t really use it in these parts."<br/>
I poured a generous amount of oil inside a large frying pan I purchased at Tarus-san’s shop. This small cask of oil already costs one silver.<br/>
"Hey, hey. Is that okay? You put in so much oil."<br/>
"This cooking method tastes better when using a large amount of oil. It won’t do to put in just a little amount."<br/>
The oil’s already heated up so I put in some meat pieces to test it out.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
I took out the meat pieces once their coating turned a nice shade of golden brown. With this, the karaage is complete. I dipped one piece in tartar sauce and had Verse taste it.<br/>
"Fried foods are best eaten right out of the frying pan."<br/>
The karaage pieces were overflowing with meat juices. The garlic flavor served as a nice accent.<br/>
I also fried some chicken tenders. The crispy coating was the best. It pairs well with the homemade tartar sauce.<br/>
"D-Delicious! Just what’s with this cooking method!?"<br/>
"Isn’t it? This is also really popular back home."<br/>
I split the work with Verse and fried the karaage and chicken tenders. The completed servings turned out to be quite the amount. It seems I won’t be able to make that oyakodonburi. We won’t be able to finish it all if I did.<br/>
I reheated the soup as well.<br/>
I found some citrus fruits inside the magic fridge as well, so I sliced some and added them to the fried food as garnishing. With this, we’re done.<br/>
It looks like Verse is done cooking the rice as well. It took quite a bit of time though. Let’s get to eating.<br/>
I and Verse carried the food out to the dining area where Cleria and the others were waiting.<br/>
"Sorry for the wait. We’ve finished cooking dinner, so please dig in. Thanks for helping out Verse. You saved me a lot of trouble."<br/>
"Don’t mind it. I have something I want to talk with you about Alan. Can I get a bit of your time if you’re free?"<br/>
"…Okay. You can talk to me whenever."<br/>
"Great. These dishes are best eaten hot. Let’s eat."<br/>
"So these are dishes from Alan’s home country! They all look marvelous."<br/>
"I made some dishes that originated from a region called Japan in my home country. I hope they’re all to your liking."<br/>
Let’s start with the soup. Un, it’s tasty. It was a good call to use only mushrooms. After observing me enjoying the soup, Cleria and Elna sipped some as well.<br/>
"Delicious! What is this soup!? It has such a refined flavor."<br/>
"I’m glad you like it. These fried foods taste better dipped into this sauce. The salad goes with this one."<br/>
I squeezed some citrus fruit juice over the fried food as well. I got some karaage and chicken tenders, put them on my plate and gave them a taste.<br/>
They really are tasty. Japanese food does taste great after all. I want to try making sushi as well. I wonder how far out we are from the sea?<br/>
"This is also delicious! I find these the most delicious out of all the dishes Alan’s cooked thus far. As expected of Alan!"<br/>
"This salad is also quite tasty! This sauce just brings out the best in it!"<br/>
It seems like Cleria rather liked the karaage. Elna became another captive of the bewitching deliciousness of mayonnaise.<br/>
Everyone became all quiet as they busied themselves with eating. Oh yeah. I think I want to drink some ale to go along with all these.<br/>
The inn girl was manning the counter, so I raised my hand and called out for her.<br/>
"Thank you for cooking a portion for me and mom as well! I ate a bit earlier and it was absolutely delicious!"<br/>
"It would have been better if you were able to eat it fresh out of the frying pan though. You still have work, so it can’t be helped I guess. I’ll have one serving of ale, please. Do you want to order some alcohol as well, girls?"<br/>
"I’ll pass, thanks."<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
"I’m also not going to drink."<br/>
Everybody else is dead set on eating huh.<br/>
"We won’t be having any alcohol besides my ale, so how about you eat up as well? I’ll call out to you once a customer comes in."<br/>
"Understood! I’ll bring the ale over right away!"<br/>
My tummy’s already settled down somewhat, so I ate some white liver sashimi while drinking my ale. The way Verse cooked the rice was nothing short of perfect. It would have been nice to have some egg on rice as well. I’ll make some next time.<br/>
Surprisingly, Cleria and the others managed to eat all the food up even though there was quite a lot earlier. I also managed to eat quite a bit, but Cleria’s appetite was truly leagues beyond me in comparison.<br/>
"It was absolutely delicious! So the food from Alan’s country is actually this tasty. I may have even overeaten."<br/>
"It was truly delicious. It’s my first time eating such tasty food."<br/>
"I’m glad you liked it. I really feel like cooking the food was worth it now."<br/>
The inn girl finished eating her fill as well later on and gave glowing reviews. I left the clean-up to her.<br/>
Once we ate our fill, we headed for the baths and slept soundly afterward.<br/>
