And this is why Firo is amazing. <br/>
Chapter 59 <br/>
 <br/>
Firo's Secret <br/>
 <br/>
The crackling of the camp-fire was the only thing that could be heard while we sat around. <br/>
There haven't been any enemies so far, but we cannot just take it easy. <br/>
In the first place we are in disguise.From the first glance it would be hard to tell that I am the Hero of the Shield. <br/>
But that's to be expected. <br/>
 <br/>
"Ahahahahahaha Firo-chan" <br/>
"Ahahahahahaha" <br/>
 <br/>
The second princess and Firo are running around the clearing without a care in the world. <br/>
Pleasant things in life include food, sleep, and a close friends. <br/>
Since I participated many times in school events in a country school and excursions to seaside summer houses, I understand how they feel. <br/>
Once I became a university student I also lodged at my friend's house. <br/>
 <br/>
But...... To think these two would be so chummy. <br/>
It might be because ever since Firo was born she never had anyone around her age or size to communicate with, so it is understandable. <br/>
No, the feeling I'm getting is what an owner feels for their domestic animals. <br/>
This second princess is a little surprising though. <br/>
I thought that this culture looked down on animals and such. <br/>
It might also be how she is coping with this unexpectedly long journey that she had no say in. <br/>
 <br/>
"Don't be too loud! We may be found." <br/>
"Okay~" <br/>
 <br/>
After replying they go right back to playing. <br/>
Seriously, after Firo made a friend it's gotten very noisy. <br/>
 <br/>
"Mel-chan, Firo will show you a treasure." <br/>
"Yay!" <br/>
 <br/>
After saying so Firo opens a bag that is concealed within the wagon, and shows the second princess it's contents. <br/>
I wonder what's in it. I am a little worried. <br/>
The treasure of that bird. Is she just collecting the stuff I throw away? <br/>
 <br/>
"Master wants to see too~?" <br/>
"Ah, yeah." <br/>
 <br/>
I approached Firo and took a look inside. <br/>
Oh, a piece of a broken sword. Also trash jewels which I threw away after failing to make accessories with. <br/>
An empty bottle. Glass marbles. <br/>
 <br/>
"It's shiny and beautiful" <br/>
"Yeah, it's beautiful." <br/>
 <br/>
The second princess is putting on quite a subtle mask. <br/>
Well, it's just garbage. <br/>
Is it because birds like shiny objects? I heard something like this before, it was an uproar caused by a crow stealing valuables.  <br/>
This might be related. <br/>
Hmm? <br/>
 <br/>
"What's this?" <br/>
 <br/>
Since there was something strange mixed in the bag I took it out. <br/>
A big brown...... furball? It has the shape of a ball, but it is very soft. <br/>
It kind of stinks. <br/>
I have a really bad feeling about this. <br/>
 <br/>
"That is...... something that came out of Firo's mouth." <br/>
 <br/>
It came out of the mouth...... of the bird. <br/>
Is this comparable to a cat's hairball? In human terms it's barf. <br/>
Bullet of the bird = Vomit. <br/>
In other words the hard objects like bones and whatnot that Firo eats are dissolved into......this. <br/>
 <br/>
"It's finished!" <br/>
 <br/>
What is? I just realised I'm still holding onto the hairball. <br/>
I threw it away. <br/>
 <br/>
"Ah Firo's treasure!" <br/>
"That's not a treasure! That's waste! If I see another one of those in your bag I'm throwing it all away!" <br/>
"Boo......" <br/>
 <br/>
Firo and the second princess seems to have a few subtle exchanges in front of me. <br/>
 <br/>
"Hey, Second princess." <br/>
"Hm?" <br/>
"When Firo changed into her human form you were not surprised." <br/>
"Yup. Because I saw it yesterday." <br/>
"I see." <br/>
 <br/>
So you already knew.  <br/>
Well that's good. <br/>
Today's dinner is grilled skewers consisting of meat from the demons we encounter. <br/>
 <br/>
"Master is good at making food!" <br/>
"How is this skewer so delicious!? It's just meat on a stick!" <br/>
 <br/>
The second princess eats anything without flinching. It seems my fears of her not eating barbaric cuisine is groundless. <br/>
I was expecting her to take a while before she was able to eat this stuff. <br/>
My expectations were betrayed. It seems the queen brought her up nicely. <br/>
 <br/>
"If it's with Naofumi-sama we can eat this everyday." <br/>
"Yay~!" <br/>
"I see, that's good." <br/>
 <br/>
Now then,for my spare time time. I'm getting quite used to camping out. <br/>
Should I study the beginner class magic book and try to learn new magic? <br/>
After a few minutes the second princess and Firo quiet down. <br/>
They are probably tired and sleeping. <br/>
Raphtalia is going to take a nap. <br/>
I can't sleep soundly if Firo or the second princess is watching the fire. <br/>
And I have to prepare for any night attacks. <br/>
 <br/>
"Hmmm......" <br/>
 <br/>
Despite it being beginner class, there are various kinds of magic. <br/>
There is a ranged version of Fast Guard and Fast Heal. <br/>
Though I haven't read the book completely some beginner class magic was learnt. <br/>
I now have magic that will increase offensive ability and speed. <br/>
I would like to learn the more difficult spells, but deciphering difficult concepts and grammar is hard. <br/>
As the firewood burns, time passes. <br/>
While mixing medicine I am unable to calm down. I haven't advanced much in poison compounding, but I can sort poisonous herbs and understand a few recipes. <br/>
There is no time to look for materials though. <br/>
 <br/>
"N......" <br/>
 <br/>
Raphtalia woke up with an absent-minded look. <br/>
 <br/>
"Oh? Did I wake you?" <br/>
"No......Do you want to change?" <br/>
"If you're fine with it." <br/>
"Okay." <br/>
 <br/>
Since Raphtalia is taking my place I decided to lay down. <br/>
 <br/>
"Umm, Naofumi-sama?" <br/>
"What's up?" <br/>
"About Firo and Princess Melty......" <br/>
 <br/>
Raphtalia points towards Firo's Philo Rial Â· Queen form with trembling fingers. <br/>
The second princess's clothes are taken off and lying around Firo who is sitting alone and rocking back and forth in her sleep. <br/>
 <br/>
"Ummmm" <br/>
 <br/>
Based on circumstantial evidence......Where is the second princess? <br/>
There is nothing behind Firo either...... <br/>
Even her shoes are there......Where is her body? <br/>
 <br/>
"No way......" <br/>
 <br/>
No matter how much of a glutton you are...... <br/>
 <br/>
"Naofumi-sama, I don't want to believe it but it seems you threatening other humans with Firo eating them may not be a bluff......" <br/>
"Nonono! No way!" <br/>
"But......Firo is" <br/>
"U....." <br/>
 <br/>
Can it be?Did you recognize Friend = Edible partner?  <br/>
Is that what you meant by wanting to help her no matter what? <br/>
 <br/>
"Raphtalia, let's do our best as fugitives." <br/>
"Yeah. Our crimes are certain now......" <br/>
 <br/>
Seriously, this Fat bird does the most outrageous things. <br/>
 <br/>
"Funya?" <br/>
 <br/>
Firo wakes up and tilts her head. <br/>
 <br/>
"Raphtalia Onee-chan? Master? What happened?" <br/>
"Firo, where is princess Melty?" <br/>
"Melty-chan? Melty-chan is sleeping within Firo's feathers." <br/>
"What? Not inside you?" <br/>
 <br/>
This is something that must be verified. <br/>
 <br/>
"Melty-chan. Wake up" <br/>
 <br/>
Firo lets her feathers on her back stand on end. <br/>
 <br/>
"N~?" <br/>
 <br/>
It is a strange sight to see, the second princess appearing from within Firo's back. <br/>
 <br/>
"What!?" <br/>
 <br/>
How is there enough room for a person inside of  Firo's feathers? <br/>
But it is undeniable that the second princess came out of a strange place. <br/>
"Firo-chan How did you do that?" <br/>
"Master did you wake me up to look for Mel-chan? Here she is." <br/>
"Firo's back is very warm......" <br/>
"......Why did you take your clothes off?" <br/>
"Because it's hot." <br/>
 <br/>
Ah......That's not surprising. <br/>
 <br/>
"How did you get so deep?" <br/>
"Firo-chan's feather's are soft and fluffy, they are also mysterious and thick you know? You want to feel it?" <br/>
"Ah, Yeah" <br/>
 <br/>
What the heck is happening in Firo's body? <br/>
Since the princess is becking I stretch my hand out. <br/>
The princess catches my hand and puts it into one of Firo's feathers. <br/>
 <br/>
"Uwaa......This is quite deep." <br/>
 <br/>
I can put my whole arm into her. <br/>
As I thought, her temperature is hot. <br/>
If the princess snuggles up in here I may not notice. <br/>
It seems to only swell a little. <br/>
 <br/>
"What the heck is with this bird's structure." <br/>
"I know right......" <br/>
"Should we examine by plucking all her feathers? I might even make a profit from selling the feathers." <br/>
"No~!" <br/>
"No roughing up Firo-chan!" <br/>
 <br/>
Hmm......Today it seems I have had a glimpse at the strange anatomy of this bird.
