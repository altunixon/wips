<br/>
What a calming number. My school ends next week, so perhaps translation speed will pick up then… or not.<br/>
Chapter 333: The Hero of the Shield Commands<br/>
"I… haven’t lost yet!" (Tact)<br/>
Tact staggers to his feet as he directs his hostility towards us.<br/>
The black miasma begins to fill the area.<br/>
Is he going to use a Curse Series?<br/>
Well, I did kill his women out of revenge.<br/>
It’s not strange for him to awaken a curse or two.<br/>
"I’ll never forgive… you all! Eri, Nellisen, Shatte, Reldia, you killed them all! I, the strongest Hero… will definitely kill you!" (Tact)<br/>
Tact turns his eyes to Ren.<br/>
It appears that he believes that he will have a chance if he steals the Legendary Sword.<br/>
How nice.<br/>
For him to be able to stand after all of our beatings, is it the power of the Seven Stars?<br/>
No, it may be one of those main character powers like will-power or determination.<br/>
That’s splendid and all, but it would be nice if he were to give up soon.<br/>
I hope he realizes that he won’t be able to beat us no matter how hard he struggles.<br/>
"You’ll still fight? Self-proclaimed hero, who couldn’t even beat a civilian like me, your life is already at its end." (Naofumi)<br/>
"Cut the crap! I am… still standing! As long as I have these legendary weapons… if I don’t have enough power, I simply have to steal it!" (Tact)<br/>
"Tact! Don’t lose!"<br/>
The women get lively as they start cheering for Tact.<br/>
If Tact truly had the power of Narrative Causality on his side, I bet we would be at a disadvantage.<br/>
Some miracle would happen, and he would awaken to some new power or something.<br/>
"I see, I see. So the fact that you’re a legendary hero is embedded this deep in your psyche." (Naofumi)<br/>
This is also just as planned.<br/>
And that’s why I’ll… steal away his last hope.<br/>
"Unfortunately, the current you won’t be able to beat Ren." (Naofumi)<br/>
"I won’t know if I don’t try!" (Tact)<br/>
Tact takes out the Claw and prepares to release a Vanzin Claw at him.<br/>
"Just understand it already. The Seven Stars can’t beat the Four Legendary. And Ren won’t… no, I won’t let you." (Naofumi)<br/>
I put my hand on the area where my shield once hung, and concentrate.<br/>
「… I, who has understood the origin of power, a simple civilian and an average Hero, the Hero of the Shield commands.」<br/>
Just like how the body needs a soul to complete itself…<br/>
Just like how a Legendary Weapon needs a Hero…<br/>
We’re bound by a single thread. I search for the point that connects me.<br/>
To counter this separation, that was supposed to be impossible, I need to form a stronger bond.<br/>
The body was made for the soul, and the soul was forged for the body.<br/>
「Let the truth be unraveled once more. My Shield is…」<br/>
Tact’s weapon flashes, and a single light flies from his hand to mine.<br/>
A strong light fills the area and blinds everyone present.<br/>
And in my field of vision, the nostalgic Shield Icon manifests.<br/>
"Wha- Impossible!"<br/>
Before using Vanzin, Tact turns to me.<br/>
And I prepare to take his attack head-on.<br/>
"Hmph!"<br/>
Using my Shield, I repel and nullify his signature move.<br/>
Now that our lost bond has been strengthened, this attack is nothing to me.<br/>
My status has returned to that of when I had the Shield before… no, it’s risen several levels.<br/>
Though my attack power is the same as always.<br/>
"What’s wrong? Is your theft ability not working?" (Naofumi)<br/>
"Impossible! How absurd! How were you able to take back the Shield!?" (Tact)<br/>
"I said it, didn’t I? You have no way of beating me. You’re already in checkmate." (Naofumi)<br/>
Having seen a scene he had never expected to see in his life, Tact opens and closes his mouth again and again.<br/>
But, even so… he still has the will to fight.<br/>
"I can’t help it. I just want so see your face colored by despair, time and time again." (Naofumi)<br/>
"Aniki, you’re making the face of a complete villain again." (Fohl)<br/>
"Naofumi sure seems used to this." (Ren)<br/>
"But that’s where Naofumi-chan’s charm lies." (Sadina)<br/>
On Sadina’s words, Ren and Fohl avert their gaze.<br/>
Yes, I can understand their feelings.<br/>
Though it seems that everyone has accepted that I look like a villain.<br/>
"Really? I think Aniki should be a bit more…" (Fohl)<br/>
"I think you’re wrong. I think it’s how he’s good at looking after others." (Ren)<br/>
"Ara? Onee-san likes this Naofumi-chan too~♥" (Sadina)<br/>
The peanut gallery should shut up.<br/>
I don’t care what you find good about me.<br/>
"Now then, your final hope… let me steal it from you." (Naofumi)<br/>
I put my hand on my Shield, and use the trump card Atlas and the Spirit of the Shield showed me.<br/>
In truth, if I had used this from the battle’s onset, the fight would already be over.<br/>
The events up until now have been but light entertainment.<br/>
Had I used it, we wouldn’t even have had to fight.<br/>
「The Hero of the Shield commands. My brethren, heed my words. Undo the foolish restraints that bind you, and awaken.」<br/>
The Claw in Tact’s hand gives off a soft light.<br/>
After confirming that, I continue.<br/>
「-Strip him of the Qualifications to command you」!<br/>
One. Two. Three. Four. Five. Six. Seven.<br/>
It’s not just the Claw. All of the weapons in his body begin to glow.<br/>
"W-what!? What’s happening!? Gu… my power is flowing out!" (Tact)<br/>
Tact can’t hide his shock from the abnormality of the situation.<br/>
In the first place, it’s wrong for a single person to assert his control over a large number of legendary weapons.<br/>
The Four and the Seven weren’t made to work like that from the beginning.<br/>
「Find wielders worthy of thine own glory」!<br/>
The seven lights from Tact… flow out, rise high into the sky, and start falling to the earth.<br/>
It’s like those wish-granting balls in a popular manga.<br/>
Oh? There’s a light flying in this direction.<br/>
Oh right, Fohl was the Hero selected by the Gauntlet, so that’s natural.<br/>
… Wait? There’s two too many.<br/>
"Eh? Ah, kya!"<br/>
"Wah? What is it?"<br/>
Light rains down on Raphtalia and Firo.<br/>
"This is… a Hammer?" (Raphtalia)<br/>
"What’s this? Claws~?" (Firo)<br/>
Yes. It seems that Raphtalia and Firo were selected by those I called my brethren.<br/>
Their names vanish from the list of slaves and monsters under my control.<br/>
"W-what foolishness is this!? To steal a weapon from Tact!? Return it at once!" (Kitsune Woman)<br/>
"Who would return such a thing!?" (Raphtalia)<br/>
Raphtalia lifts the large hammer up high and swings it downwards at the Kitsune Woman, who took up the form of a nine-tailed fox.<br/>
"Let’s see… 「Thor Hammer」!" (Raphtalia)<br/>
The second Raphtalia’s hammer hits the nine-tails, lightning strikes down.<br/>
"GYAAAAAAAAAH!"<br/>
Along with the Kitsune woman’s scream, I heard a splattering sound.<br/>
"Uwah…"<br/>
It appears that Raphtalia has smashed that woman’s head.<br/>
"Rafu~."<br/>
Raph-chan, who had been covering his ears from the monsterous sound, made a pose of victory.<br/>
I believe the other end happened at the same time.<br/>
"Die! Filo Rial Queen Candidate!"<br/>
"Whoah." (Firo)<br/>
Firo suddenly… deployed something?<br/>
It only appeared for an instant, but isn’t that the Wall that Atlas and I use?<br/>
Why is she able to use it?<br/>
No, well, Firo did train with us quite often, so…<br/>
"Eh? Ah?"<br/>
The gryphon crashes head-first into the wall.<br/>
Firo doesn’t let the chance go. She puts her foot on the Gryphon’s neck and…<br/>
「Erste Claw」?<br/>
An ominous sound echoes through the air.<br/>
And just like that, the Gryphon crashes to the ground.<br/>
Firo flaps her wings a few times and lands.<br/>
Over her feet are the Seven Star Claws.<br/>
"These are really light! Firo accidentally overdid it!" (Firo)<br/>
"Turna! Ashiel! You… even took the Seven Stars from me!? What the hell is happening!?" (Tact)<br/>
Tact is trembling with fear, but I don’t feel any pity in myself for him.<br/>
"From the start, we were merely playing around with you. Did you think that you were all that, you small fry?" (Naofumi)<br/>
"Go to hell!" (Tact)<br/>
Even so, without accepting reality, Tact was already moving to punch me.<br/>
A loud sound rings out as his hand collides with my face.<br/>
But I don’t feel anything.<br/>
"Uu… ah… ah." (Tact)<br/>
"With this, you aren’t a Hero, or anything more. Just try and turn around this situation." (Naofumi)<br/>
Having lost his Hero Status, we can execute Tact without having any negative influence on the world.<br/>
Of course, quite a few problems will pop up because of the Heroes he’s killed himself…<br/>
"You get it? This it the difference between a real Hero, and a wannabe. You contented yourself with your transient power, but now your age is over. Your crime of playing with the world, make up for it with your body!" (Naofumi)<br/>
「Shield Prison! → Change Shield (Attack)」<br/>
A cage made of Shields surrounds Tact, and through my Change Shield, they all become Shields furnished with spikes.<br/>
I’m holding back to an extent where it won’t kill him, so there are no problems.<br/>
I really do want to kill him now, but there’s a reason I can’t.<br/>
At the very least, as long as the possibility exists that he’s a reincarnated individual, I can’t kill him so easily.<br/>
I need to know what god or demon is backing this bastard.<br/>
