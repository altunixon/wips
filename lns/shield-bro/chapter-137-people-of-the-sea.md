Chapter 137: The People of the Sea<br/>
(Note people is written here as Men and Women)<br/>
Garagaragaragara…<br/>
On that day, a carriage with a supplies from the queen arrived.<br/>
"I heard the Hero of the Shield could be found here." (Knight)<br/>
"What do you need?" (Naofumi)<br/>
The knight who came with the carriage addresses me.<br/>
I think I’ve seen this face before… I think she was practicing swordsmanship with Rafatalia.<br/>
Her appearance is… that of a standard female knight from a game. If she takes off her helmet, I think her face will rival Rafatalia’s in beauty.<br/>
Her hair is long and strawberry-blond. Most of it is stuffed into her helmet.<br/>
Her eyes are blue, like Firo’s. She looks like she would fit the role of a Wicked Queen perfectly.<br/>
She is accompanied by other knights, one of whom I recognize as part of volunteer army that helped me during the wave before the last.<br/>
"Hero of the Shield!" (Volunteer)<br/>
"You… How have you been?" (Naofumi)<br/>
"We’re working hard on rebuilding the city." (Volunteer)<br/>
"I’ll bet. But, that’s not what I’m asking. What has happened to you guys since then?" (Naofumi)<br/>
"Nothing major has changed. I’ve been sent here to act as a messengers while the others here are reinforcements." (Volunteer)<br/>
"Ah, I see." (Naofumi)<br/>
The Queen seems to have completely grasped my train of thought. She has already sent more personnel.<br/>
"For now, it’s just me, but I have been instructed to act as the official messenger between here and the castle." (Volunteer)<br/>
"Not the Shadows?" (Naofumi)<br/>
"Those people are to act as the unofficial messengers." (Volunteer)<br/>
What’s the difference?… Well it doesn’t really matter.<br/>
"I’ve been asked to act as a martial arts instructor for the slaves." (Female Knight)<br/>
"Ah, that will be helpful." (Naofumi)<br/>
Rafatalia is mostly self-taught. It’s good to have someone with professional training experience.<br/>
"So… where are the ever-so-important slaves right now?" (Female Knight)<br/>
"I sent them out to level grind. I think they’ll be around level 25 when they get back." (Naofumi)<br/>
"Fumu… Your lessons sure are fast-paced." (Female Knight)<br/>
"It’s Spartan style. Also, I plan to have around 30 more people for non-combat related purposes." (Naofumi)<br/>
"For what purpose would that be?" (Volunteer)<br/>
"This and that. Well, we also need to rebuild the buildings." (Naofumi)<br/>
"Understood, I’ll relay that to the castle." (Volunteer)<br/>
Now then, I need to move on to the next task as well.<br/>
Recently I’ve been researching various plants. I’m trying to see why I can’t modify certain substances.<br/>
There are quite a few faults to my modification skills.<br/>
For some reason, there are some plants I can edit and some I cannot.<br/>
In that respect, the Bioplant is very easy to modify.<br/>
So I’ll see if I can make that Bioplant produce some simple medicine.<br/>
I finish readying a plot for the plant without issue.<br/>
"The Hero of the shield sure is enthusiastic." (Kiel)<br/>
Kiel, who had just returned, stumbles out of the carriage.<br/>
He has stopped complaining to me about cooking, but…<br/>
Guu…<br/>
His stomach still growls.<br/>
A few days later.<br/>
"Ahaha~!" (Child)<br/>
The slaves are having fun climbing up the Bioplant.<br/>
Their levels have all passed 30. Their appearances also changed, and they now look to be around 14-15 years old.<br/>
They only look slightly younger than Rafatalia. They have started to look an age that can actually be sent out to battle. They seem to be growing quite healthily.<br/>
Their appearance… well I would put it above village children. But there is no one here who rivals Rafatalia in looks. It just seems that they are eating proper meals.<br/>
Out of the boys, the one with the best face is probably Kiel. His face looks like a girls. He might grow into a Pretty boy one day (TL: Bishounen). Rather than saying he looks like a boy, it would be more accurate to say he looks like a boyish girl.<br/>
Not that it matters to me.<br/>
"Hey, Shield-Niichan! We’ve only been having meat and vegetables for a while. I’m tired of it." (Kiel)<br/>
(TL: I’m debating whether or not to translate Shield-Niichan as Shieldbro)<br/>
"Don’t be selfish." (Naofumi)<br/>
For some reason, he’s started to become quite impudent. It’s getting to be quite a pain to deal with.<br/>
I should try to set him straight, but he does his work fine, so there’s not much I can do.<br/>
He’s been acting quite familiar with me. He’s talking to me as a younger brother rather than a slave. He has also begin to say, ‘Thank you’ when getting food.<br/>
As long as he’s motivated…<br/>
It seems many of these children were used for physical labor before.<br/>
It may seem strange coming from me, but many consider it unethical to send child slaves into battle. They are mostly used for other purposes.<br/>
They are quite skillful at physical work.<br/>
"Hey, I’m going to go off to the ocean and catch some fish, so please cook them, Nii-chan." (Kiel)<br/>
"I don’t remember becoming your brother!" (Naofumi)<br/>
Kiel is definitely looking down on me.<br/>
Should I lecture him?<br/>
Oh right, Kiel seems to be shorter than the other boys.<br/>
His voice is also higher.<br/>
"I would also like some fish." (Rishia)<br/>
Rishia and the other slaves voice out their agreement.<br/>
"Niichan, I want to eat Seafood!" (Kiel)<br/>
"Yeah!" (Child)<br/>
"Seafood!" (Child)<br/>
Damn, it seems I have mass produced Firos.<br/>
It’s a good thing the eggs haven’t hatched yet.<br/>
There’s no way I could handle a strange monster joining in here.<br/>
"Ah, I got it. Today we’ll go to the beach to catch some fish. While we’re there, Firo, go swim out and capture some aquatic monsters." (Naofumi)<br/>
"Yes~!" (Children in unison)<br/>
And so it turned out that we were headed for the sea.<br/>
Well, it has been getting quite hot lately.<br/>
Swimming around a bit won’t hurt.<br/>
These people… They lived here before, so they can swim, right?<br/>
And so, after a short walk, we reach our destination.<br/>
"Kyahaha~!" (Children)<br/>
And so the slaves enthusiastically run out towards the water carrying harpoons. They all take off their clothes and enter in their underwear…<br/>
In the middle of this, I noticed… Rafatalia and Rishia noticed as well.<br/>
"Naofumi-sama!?" (Rafatalia)<br/>
"Eh? Eh!?" (Rishia)<br/>
"Firo! Go catch Kiel!" (Naofumi)<br/>
"? I got it." (Firo)<br/>
"Wah!? What is it!" (Kiel)<br/>
Firo drags Kiel out of the ocean.<br/>
Kiel is violently struggling under Firo’s arm.<br/>
"What is it, Shield Nii-chan!?" (Kiel)<br/>
"Let me say this first. I don’t really care, but there is something I must point out a large problem in the way you act." (Naofumi)<br/>
"And I’m asking what it is!" (Kiel)<br/>
The other slaves notice the commotion, and come over.<br/>
They seem to have caught on to the problem.<br/>
"Kiel-kun… are you possibly supposed to be Kiel-chan?" (Rafatalia)<br/>
"Wha?! What are you talking about? I’m a boy." (Kiel)<br/>
Kiel’s chest has a bandage wrapped around it, and he… she is wearing a loincloth below.<br/>
… For obvious reasons, Rafatalia is pointing at Kiel’s nether regions.<br/>
Recently I have been unable to read Rafatalia’s behavior.<br/>
It may be that meeting up with old friends has restored some lost parts of her personality.<br/>
"Kiel-kun… do you know the difference between a man and a woman?" (Rafatalia)<br/>
"???" (Kiel)<br/>
"Um, you know… A man is someone who has…" (Rafatalia)<br/>
Rafatalia begins whispering in Kiel’s ear.<br/>
"That can’t be true. If I were god, I wouldn’t do something so painstaking as to differentiate men and women like that." (Kiel)<br/>
"Then please look at the other boys No, look at Naofumi-sama. He’s a bit different, isn’t he? His chest isn’t wrapped right?" (Rafatalia)<br/>
"What are you talking about? That’s what happens when you become an adult. I just have a bit of excess fat so my chest sticks out. When I become an adult, it will fix itself."<br/>
The BS is spilling out at quite an alarming rate.<br/>
… How the hell was Kiel raised before becoming a slave?<br/>
I have too many questions.<br/>
Or was she perhaps raised without such standards? Was she allowed to freely choose her definition for Male and Female?<br/>
Whatever the case, she was definitely raised abnormally.<br/>
Anyways, how did no one notice during the time he was a slave?<br/>
…Was this part of the Slave Dealer’s schemes?<br/>
If I were the Slave Dealer, I wouldn’t go to the trouble of changing a slave’s world view, and would just sell her as is.<br/>
This country is quite rotten. There’s probably a perverted noble who would buy her thinking she were a pretty boy.<br/>
And maybe another pervert who found Kiel’s lack of gender Identity to be a turn on. All this just raises her selling price.<br/>
It seems she has already been sold a few times.<br/>
I think I heard that she had broken too many plates at her last place and had thus been returned…<br/>
Kiel also has some signs of significant physical abuse, so I guess she didn’t receive any preferential treatment.<br/>
It seems that the abuse of Demi-human slaves is quite common in this country.<br/>
Rafatalia also showed such signs of abuse.<br/>
I guess this is the aftereffects of the recent war with Silt Welt.<br/>
Out of the 8 slaves one of them said that they were saved by a hero before.<br/>
I guess even those people can’t stand to see children being abused.<br/>
I see that they had left the issue to the country, and the child had eventually been resold as a slave anyways.<br/>
In the few days since she came here, I’ve gotten a good grasp on what personality Kiel has.<br/>
Around 6 of the new slaves still act cautiously when away from Rafatalia.<br/>
But that isn’t an issue I have any influence over. I’ll leave that to Rafatalia and Rishia.<br/>
At night, Rafatalia puts the other children to sleep, and sometimes sleeps next to them.<br/>
She also went through a similar experience, so she is able to understand their problems.<br/>
Even if I stay around, I don’t think they will open their hearts to me.<br/>
Firo, being Firo is able to interact well with them.<br/>
She seems to be good with dealing with children in general, that bird.<br/>
This may be similar to the practice of Animal Therapy. (TL: google it)<br/>
However, the children still get nauseous at the sight of her prized carriage.<br/>
"B-but father said that a man is a man if he thinks he is a man no matter what." (Kiel)<br/>
So did the daughter began to imitate her father’s manly attitude?<br/>
And anyways, that talk in itself is implying that you are a woman.<br/>
She was raised like someone from a story I had heard about.<br/>
(TL: I don’t know the reference. Possibly Yukimura of Boku wa Tomodachi ga Tsukunai)<br/>
The other female slaves laugh amongst themselves.<br/>
I’ve heard some women like to imagine boys who cross-dress, but what do they think of a Girl who wants to be a man of the sea?<br/>
"This can’t be… I mean, what’s the point of separating man and woman anyways!? I don’t even know anymore!" (Kiel)<br/>
Author note (TL: The Real one)<br/>
Kiel wasn’t meant to be an important character, however the personality I gave him overlapped with another male character I planned to make down the road, so I decided to give ‘him’ a little… quirk.<br/>
