SS: The Phantom Underground Empire<br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
I am Chuu Fat. <TLN: Call itself using 'Wagahai'><br/>
An excellent name given by my great master.<br/>
<br/>
I said, 'chuu chuu', to gather my followers.<br/>
I distribute the cheese soufflé that the black-haired celestial maiden-sama has bestowed me to my followers.<br/>
<br/>
The celestial maiden-sama is a retainer of my great master, she's an expert cook.<br/>
<br/>
I take a bite too.<br/>
It's truly delicious.<br/>
<br/>
This clear rich flavor melts my thought with my instinct.<br/>
<br/>
--Cheese is dangerous.<br/>
<br/>
When I came back to my sense, the cheese soufflé in the large plate had disappeared, and there were the figures of my followers sleeping with full bellies while looking satisfied.<br/>
<br/>
I was thinking of using their favorite food to raise their morales....<br/>
<br/>
Well fine, it's natural to sleep after eating something good.<br/>
I will also sleep for a bit.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
◇<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
It has already been 10 days since I was given intelligence by my great master.<br/>
The three of my wives who evolved together with me have all delivered children.<br/>
<br/>
It is good that the Sage Mouse species increases, but I ought to increase my servant followers too.<br/>
<br/>
Fighting is all about number.<br/>
Because my mission is building an underground empire in this Royal Capital and presenting it to Master!<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
◇<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
The green devil hunted my servants yet again.<br/>
After having a fierce fight with the sewage rats in the underground tunnel, the expansion of our newly built underground empire on the surface was hindered by that guy.<br/>
<br/>
In front of the devil that came sweeping down from the sky, even I, who's overflowed with intelligence, am not able to do anything.<br/>
<br/>
--No, 'was not'.<br/>
<br/>
It'll be different from now on.<br/>
<br/>
Swoosh, I froze when I heard sounds of flapping wings, but my fear went away when I heard the 'chuu' afterward.<br/>
When I turn around, I see the figures of my sons.<br/>
<br/>
I'm fascinated by my gallant sons who are riding on the back of the ravens.<br/>
They, the Raven Riders, are the elites of our underground empire.<br/>
<br/>
There will be nothing that can stand against us who have attained mobility in the sky.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
◇<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
--How could this be!<br/>
<br/>
I can't believe that more than 10 strong Raven Riders got easily crushed!<br/>
If this keeps up, my charisma as the emperor will dwindle.<br/>
<br/>
I cannot fail here.<br/>
I have to offer everything in this Royal Capital to my great master.<br/>
<br/>
Chuu chuu!<br/>
I make a speech in front of my followers and servants.<br/>
<br/>
Gununu, looks like it was too difficult for them, not only the servants, even the followers have fallen asleep.<br/>
These guys can't understand at all that the existence of this underground empire hangs on this battle.<br/>
<br/>
I have my followers who are equipped with spears and shields to ride on giant ravens, and then I order us to take off while sitting on the throne installed on a giant raven.<br/>
<br/>
The green devil quickly showed itself the moment we left the chimney.<br/>
Even while flinching to the sound wave attack, pirupiru, we gallantly stay in the battlefield without fleeing.<br/>
<br/>
The magic spear long chopstick didn't faze the devil, and even the magic shield pot lid couldn't withstand the devil's beak.<br/>
Before I knew it, all of my followers have been defeated by the devil, my life is only a matter of time.<br/>
<br/>
How could this happen.<br/>
To think I, who have been created by my great master, would lose my life in such a place!<br/>
<br/>
--Piruru?!<br/>
<br/>
The devil who had caught me in its talon looked up to the sky and cried.<br/>
<br/>
--ＫＹＥＷＷＲＯＵＵＵＮ.<br/>
<br/>
A giant monster bigger than the green devil fell from the sky.<br/>
The creature who landed before the devil, sat down in front of it, the reverse of what happened with me and the devil earlier.<br/>
<br/>
How pleasant.<br/>
My life would end together with the devil, however, my descendants will inherit the empire.<br/>
<br/>
Now, giant monster.<br/>
Eat the devil.<br/>
<br/>
Covering my frightened heart with haughty words, I close my eyes and wait for my end.<br/>
<br/>
"Huh? Why is the infant dragon in a place like this? What's this, Hisui is here too huh?"<br/>
<br/>
This voice is of my great master!<br/>
<br/>
--ＫＹＥＷＷＲＯＵＵＵＮ.<br/>
--Pipiru! Piru! Piru!<br/>
<br/>
For some reason, the giant monster and the devil were delighted like me when they saw Master.<br/>
We look at each others....<br/>
<br/>
Apparently, these guys are servants of my great master too.<br/>
<br/>
As expected of my great master.<br/>
I will give my all along with Royal Capital to you.<br/>
<br/>
Joining hands with the green devil the ruler of the sky, and the giant monster that resembles the legendary dragon, we will dominate all.<br/>
<br/>
Please wait for a little bit of time, my great master--Satou-sama.<br/>
My loyalty will forever be with the great you.<br/>
