Chapter 201: Trash and Atlas<br/>
"Firo-chan’s back!" (Atlas)<br/>
Atlas says as she comes into the house.<br/>
I wonder if she managed to get back the levels she lost.<br/>
With just a little more, Atlas will be able to Class Up. The two are actually quite close in level now.<br/>
"Her timing is quite good." (Naofumi)<br/>
I leave Female Knight and Ren to their training, and go out to meet Firo.<br/>
"I, who has understood the source of power command. Let the truth once more be read forth. Wash away the origin of my hatred!"<br/>
「Dreifach Aquablast」<br/>
As I exit the building, I hear magic being chanted.<br/>
On reflex, I tense my body and prepare my shield… Like a baseball, I return the magic by batting it with my shield.<br/>
"Wa!"<br/>
The caster of the magic just barely manages to avoid it by a paper-thin margin.<br/>
Of course, I could identify the caster by voice from the beginning.<br/>
She’s more talented than her sister.<br/>
"What are you trying to do!? (Melty)<br/>
"That’s my line, Melty." (Naofumi)<br/>
"Can you not even think of a reason as to why you were being targeted?" (Melty)<br/>
"Nope. Especially not from you." (Naofumi)<br/>
"What was that!? (Melty)<br/>
Firo coming home obviously means that Melty came back as well.<br/>
What level has Melty become?<br/>
She was 18 before, I think.<br/>
That magic from before was quite potent. I’d say her level has at least doubled.<br/>
"Master, I’m home~!" (Firo)<br/>
"Yeah, welcome back." (Naofumi)<br/>
Firo is approaching me with a posture suggesting that she wants me to pat her head. I reluctantly pat it.<br/>
She just returned, but her feathers are strangely tidy.<br/>
Did Melty groom her?<br/>
She feels softer than when I pat her before.<br/>
Yeah, I guess I should groom her if I ever feel like it.<br/>
"Nope, you say!? You made Firo drag me off to a distant remote location to level without asking for my input." (Melty)<br/>
"That is, well… It’s fine isn’t it?" (Naofumi)<br/>
"I’m angry because it isn’t fine!" (Melty)<br/>
As always, she’s quite worked up.<br/>
If she toned down a bit, she might make a nice conversation partner.<br/>
Though I get the feeling that all of this might be my fault.<br/>
"Firo, how high did your level climb?" (Naofumi)<br/>
"Um, Firo got to 63 and Melty got to 40." (Firo)<br/>
"I see. That’s higher than I expected." (Naofumi)<br/>
"I came back because I thought we could Class Up Melty-chan." (Firo)<br/>
"I see. I see." (Naofumi)<br/>
"… I smell Gaelion’s scent from Master. You haven’t been sleeping with him, right? I also have the feeling that Firo’s territory has turned into Gaelion’s!" (Firo)<br/>
Ah, her intuition is sharp.<br/>
And I don’t remember this ever being your territory…<br/>
Both Firo and Gaelion go around arbitrarily turning my land into their territories.<br/>
But I guess complaining to my pets won’t get me anywhere.<br/>
"Yes, we slept. I’m not sure about territory, but I had him erect an anti-teleportation field." (Naofumi)<br/>
"Bu-!" (Firo)<br/>
She starts rubbing her head on me and clinging onto me with her wings.<br/>
It’s a bit annoying.<br/>
"I’m never giving master over to Gaelion!" (Firo)<br/>
"Ah, yes, yes." (Naofumi)<br/>
This is a pain.<br/>
Oh? I just got an idea.<br/>
"We’re going to Class Up soon, so go do some intense training with Atlas. If you do so, I won’t sleep with Gaelion." (Naofumi)<br/>
"Sure! Atlas-cha~n!" (Firo)<br/>
Firo sure is energetic. She left Melty and ran off at an alarming rate.<br/>
All of my annoyances have disappeared. It’s finally quiet.<br/>
"…" (Melty)<br/>
Melty makes eye contact with me, and she stares silently.<br/>
"Hmph!" (Melty)<br/>
Melty stomps off. Some soldiers accompany her.<br/>
The future queen is quite an unpleasant person.<br/>
After that, I went to make medicine with Rat. Recently, I’ve been having her teach me some alchemy.<br/>
After the sun starts to set, I take a break.<br/>
If Atlas were here, I’d train with her. As she’s gone, I asked Rishia and Female Knight to help me.<br/>
After dinner, I returned to making medicine.<br/>
This has become my basic schedule in the village.<br/>
Ren trains with Female Knight deep into the night.<br/>
The next morning, Firo and Atlas returned.<br/>
That was quick.<br/>
"Firo-chan is cruel. I wanted to spar with Naofumi-sama."  (Atlas)<br/>
"But Atlas-chan. You will Class Up soon, right?" (Firo)<br/>
"Are you sure you don’t want to get to the level cap?" (Naofumi)<br/>
"Hm… It seems that Atlas-chan will be fine. Fitoria says that." (Firo)<br/>
"Why?" (Naofumi)<br/>
"Because Master is here, she says." (Firo)<br/>
Does she know the necessary conditions?<br/>
I can ask her, but I’ll have to use Firo as a medium, so that sounds annoying.<br/>
"Then I guess we should depart for Atlas and Melty’s Class Up soon." (Naofumi)<br/>
With these two, I think just taking Firo will be fine.<br/>
"Then I’ll go get Melty-chan." (Firo)<br/>
"Go get her." (Naofumi)<br/>
In around 5 minutes, Firo comes back with Melty. She’s still pouting.<br/>
Perhaps I should leave Atlas to Firo next time too.<br/>
I think as I activate the Portal shield to take us to the castle.<br/>
"Now then…" (Naofumi)<br/>
"Amazing. We really warped to the Castle in an instant." (Melty)<br/>
Melty looks around the castle’s courtyard in amazement.<br/>
It truly is a convenient skill. I knew that from the beginning.<br/>
Motoyasu said in his game it could only transport 6 people, but I should test that theory.<br/>
I haven’t really played with this skill too much. The cool down time is a bit long.<br/>
"So this is Melty-chan’s castle." (Atlas)<br/>
"Not mine, but my mother’s." (Melty)<br/>
Is the conversation they were having when…<br/>
"The Shield brought a Hakuko again!" (Trash)<br/>
Trash comes running at us again.<br/>
"F-father!? What the hell are you wearing!?" (Melty)<br/>
This time… for some reason he’s wearing what seems to be a bunny suit.<br/>
Is it Usapill based?<br/>
What sort of punishment is this?<br/>
I nod at Melty’s embarrassment.<br/>
"Eh?" (Atlas)<br/>
Atlas turns her head towards Trash as she lets out a sound.<br/>
"Eh…" (Trash)<br/>
Trash’s steps slow and he comes to a stop…<br/>
What? He has a very strange expression as she stands still.<br/>
He seems to be crying. But he’s also smiling. It’s quite a complex face.<br/>
"Onii-sama?" (Atlas)<br/>
"What are you saying?" (Naofumi)<br/>
How could she mistake Trash for Fohl?<br/>
They might be annoying in similar ways, but they are fundamentally different.<br/>
Mostly in age and stature… But Atlas can’t see that.<br/>
"…" (Trash)<br/>
Trash seems to have come out of a trance. He turns around and starts walking off unsteadily.<br/>
"Oy." (Naofumi)<br/>
Trash doesn’t seem to hear me.<br/>
What could have happened to him?<br/>
"Ah, Mother!" (Melty)<br/>
A few minutes later, the Queen makes her appearance.<br/>
I told her of how Trash caused a commotion as soon as we got here, but left when he saw Atlas’s face.<br/>
"I see… Such a thing happened." (Queen)<br/>
"Do you have any idea why? That’s the first time I’ve seen Trash like that." (Naofumi)<br/>
"Atlas-san, was it? Please let me see your face for a second." (Queen)<br/>
"Yes?" (Atlas)<br/>
Atlas steps forwards, and turns her face to the Queen.<br/>
"…I see. So that’s why." (Queen)<br/>
"Did you figure something out?" (Naofumi)<br/>
"Explaining will take a while, but is that fine?" (Queen)<br/>
"Let’s see… That sounds annoying, but seeing Trash like that made me curious." (Naofumi)<br/>
"I’ll omit what I can. Don’t worry." (Queen)<br/>
The Queen stares at Atlas as she begins speaking.<br/>
"The Hero of the Cane, Luge Lancarose had a younger sister who was unable to see. Their ages were quite separated." (Queen)<br/>
She isn’t going to call him Trash. I guess that’s fine.<br/>
So he had a little sister?<br/>
"There were a few complications with Luge’s birth, but that isn’t very important so I will omit it." (Queen)<br/>
"Are you sure it’s not important?" (Naofumi)<br/>
"Then shall I tell you? Luge’s real name was Luge Lances Faubley. He was the third legitimate heir to the throne of Faubley." (Queen)<br/>
"Faubley is the strongest country in this world, right? So he was that country’s prince?" (Naofumi)<br/>
"At first, but then an incident came that robbed him of that privilege. That incident involved the killing of his parents and many others close to him by the Hakuko." (Queen)<br/>
So his life’s been a soap opera, that Trash.<br/>
Is that why he hates Atlas and Fohl of the Hakuko race so much?<br/>
"Luckily, Luge and his sister were not there at the time, but the country of Faubley did nothing in retaliation against Silt Welt for political reasons. Because of that, Luge began to despise both Faubley and Silt Welt. He moved to my country which discriminated against Demi-Humans and changed his own name." (Queen)<br/>
And thus began Trash’s fight.<br/>
"Luge hid the fact that he was of Royal Blood, and rushed onto the frontlines of the wars Melromark waged. Along the way, he was selected to be the master of the Seven Star Cane, and he began to spread his name as a Hero." (Queen)<br/>
What a smooth rise to fame. I’m jealous.<br/>
But… the Queen takes on a somewhat troubled face.<br/>
"At that time, I was still young. That man’s resourcefulness and strength won my heart." (Queen)<br/>
"I don’t need your love story. Please continue." (Naofumi)<br/>
"But while Luge ventured off, he had left behind his sightless sister. Soon, he received word that… She had disappeared with nothing left behind but a pool of blood. That the Hakukos had killed her. Luge’s desire for revenge strengthened. After many years of war, He challenged and defeated the Hakuko king of Silt Welt." (Queen)<br/>
"… And? How is that related to this?" (Naofumi)<br/>
I do have a hunch.<br/>
Probably…<br/>
"Yes, Iwatani-sama. As you thought, Atlas-san’s face looks exactly like that of Luge’s younger sister. She looks like an exact replica of Lucia." (Queen)<br/>
