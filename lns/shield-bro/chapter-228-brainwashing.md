CHAPTER 228: BRAINWASH<br/>
Now, for the guy who put poison in the well<br/>
The water… might not have been from the river.<br/>
The water of the river is fundamentally different from the water of the well.<br/>
I think it would have taken time for the poison that flowed through the river to arrive at the well via underground.<br/>
We can also consider if it went through the soil, but I think the poison was poured directly into the well.<br/>
Still…<br/>
A major problem remains.<br/>
My village isn’t made so that anyone can come in easily.<br/>
Because I was wary, I placed a guard originally so that only slaves and people who I trust can enter.<br/>
Needless to say, Gaelion and the filorials would have said something to me if there was a stranger around.<br/>
Thus, the evidence suggests that the well was poisoned by an internal perpetrator.<br/>
I do not like to doubt.<br/>
I mean, I should have set it up so if you performed such an estranged act, you would pay with the price of life.<br/>
"Gaelion!" (Naofumi)<br/>
In accordance to my call, Gaelion came flying.<br/>
"What is it?" (Gaelion)<br/>
"You were in the village today." (Naofumi)<br/>
"Yeah."(Gaelion)<br/>
"Was there a fellow who did something to the well?" (Naofumi)<br/>
"Even if you say that… There were not any particularly strange people." (Gaelion)<br/>
"What about soldiers and visitors from the castle?" (Naofumi)<br/>
"No." (Gaelion)<br/>
Identification of the criminal is getting difficult.<br/>
The slave crests aren’t working.<br/>
Also, Gaelion said no soldier or magic person/seller came to the village.<br/>
Well, it could be that the precautionary ability of Gaelion can’t be fully trusted.<br/>
Therefore, I went back to the village and gathered slaves to ask them.<br/>
"I want to identify the time when the poison was poured. Who was the last to drink the water and be safe?" (Naofumi)<br/>
To my question, a few slaves raised their hands and took their time to talk respectively.<br/>
I learned that the well water was moved to the water jars for cooking just a little while ago.<br/>
"I wonder who the culprit was?" (Naofumi)<br/>
"Excuse me, Naofumi-sama." (Atla)<br/>
"Hmm, what happened?" (Naofumi)<br/>
Atla raised her hand and made a proposal.<br/>
Her face seemed tense or something.<br/>
Was there something that only Atla can sense?<br/>
Atla slowly returned to the clinic and pointed at Imia’s uncle who was resting in the corner of the dining room.<br/>
"Imia’s uncle, something abominable is coiling itself around you." (Atla)<br/>
"Huh?" (Naofumi)<br/>
Imia’s uncle looked around in a perplexed expression after being confronted by Atlas.<br/>
"I’m, what are you saying? Please be careful while joking." (Imia’s uncle)<br/>
"Yeah Atla, no matter what, for uncle to do such a thing–"(Naofumi)<br/>
"It’s, so… No… actually, I remember causing something-" (Imia’s uncle)<br/>
Imia’s uncle was at his wit’s end and began to groan.<br/>
He pushed Imia away toward the other slaves and staggered away unsteadily.<br/>
"Hero of the Shield, please, I…" (Imia’s uncle)<br/>
Imia’s uncle asked for help as he suffered.<br/>
No, wait…<br/>
"Please punish me… Before I commit a crime again!" (Imia’s Uncle)<br/>
"When the thieves caught you, did they put a curse on you!?" (Naofumi)<br/>
"I understand, oh… Guu…"<br/>
I opened Imia’s uncle’s slave status.<br/>
To state the problem… It was different.<br/>
There’s noise! <This kind of Noise><br/>
It’s apparent that something strange was going on .<br/>
If you thought about it calmly, he was found a day after he was supposed to arrive.<br/>
Basically, where he was attacked was uncertain.<br/>
What would have happened if Elena hadn’t passed by, I don’t know.<br/>
What would I do if I happened to pass by and had to escape from a strong adventurer?<br/>
Imia’s uncle was taken to the clinic for treatment.<br/>
And there’s no doubt that he specifically came back to the village to pour poison in the well as he was ordered.<br/>
The problem is that whatever was eroding Imia’s uncle might escape the eye of treatment.<br/>
"Hero of the Shield!" (Slaves)<br/>
"Naofumi." (Ren)<br/>
The slaves, Ren, and Atla asked me for help.<br/>
‘I am not almighty,’ I want to say that, but I can’t. I understand the feeling of wanting help.<br/>
"We,… oh, huh!" (Atla)<br/>
"It’s no good!" (Ren)<br/>
Rishia stepped forward and stood with Imia’s uncle.<br/>
"Even though, I know how is it done!? For me,…… I can’t hold out my hand" (Imia’s uncle)<br/>
Even Ren, who’s acquainted with the slaves, can’t lend a hand?<br/>
Similarly, even the female knight cannot move.<br/>
I think, this is an abnormal situation.<br/>
If she slays Imia’s uncle, I’ll have to banish Female Knight.<br/>
I’ve been called indecisive.<br/>
I can’t follow the situation.<br/>
What should I do?<br/>
Well, if it was a game, persuasion would be the means to restore a former companion who was manipulated by someone, but it’s quite difficult in reality to break free from brainwashing. This is not a game.<br/>
Still, I cannot deal with everyone<br/>
By no means is it easy. It’s quite troublesome.<br/>
"Uncle! Please stop! ‘I’d like to be of assistance to the Hero of the Shield,’ wasn’t it you who said that!?" (Imia)<br/>
"Oh, that… GUU… " (Imia’s uncle)<br/>
Imia’s uncle’s consciousness was becoming cloudy. This is not the situation for persuasion.<br/>
"Everything… Justice…" (Imia’s uncle)<br/>
He began to chant in a strange tone.<br/>
"Please… Stop me–" (Imia’s uncle)<br/>
Imia’s uncle began to chant magic.<br/>
The Lemo species knew the appropriateness of the soil.<br/>
He used magic that manipulated the earth to make a hole and pushed out a rock using magic.<br/>
"I am one who commands the origin of power. I have read once again and deciphered a law of nature, Earth. Slaughter these people! Zweit Earth Drive! ( ツヴァイト・アースドライブ)" (Imia’s uncle)<br/>
"I as the root of the power give an order. I have read once again and deciphered a law of nature, Earth. Hinder the magic of the person in front! Anti-Zweit Earth Drive! ( ツヴァイト・アースドライブ)" (Imia)<br/>
From the same species, Imia interfered with the magic that Imia’s uncle chanted, and there was simply a crack in the ground.<br/>
"Naofumi!" (Rat)<br/>
"What is it?" (Naofumi)<br/>
"Please confine Imia’s uncle by creating a wall in four directions! Needless to say, the strongest one. Please." (Rat)<br/>
I see! Such a thing!<br/>
I started building magic power and mix SP into it.<br/>
"Uhh…" (Imia’s uncle)<br/>
Imia grabbed her uncle and looked at me.<br/>
"Now! Hero!" (Imia)<br/>
"Are you sure?" (Naofumi)<br/>
"Stop me! Please! I request it." (Imia’s uncle)<br/>
"Understood! Shield Prison!" (Naofumi)<br/>
The cage made with shields confined Imia’s uncle together with Imia.<br/>
"Atla?" (Naofumi)<br/>
"Yes, the abominable power was interrupted by the cage, and its power was cut." (Atla)<br/>
"So did it go elsewhere?" (Naofumi)<br/>
"No one among these here." (Atla)<br/>
"That’s fortunate." (Naofumi)<br/>
It would be serious if someone began to behave violently like Imia’s uncle did.<br/>
Afterward…<br/>
"First of all, for now, let’s figure out the situation before the cage disappears." (Naofumi)<br/>
"Oh."<br/>
"Yes."<br/>
It is certain that Imia’s uncle was the one who poured poison into the well.<br/>
Perhaps it’s a kind of curse.<br/>
Thinking about it, the same as back then with Motoyasu, it looks without a doubt like a Legendary Weapon skill.<br/>
Ren has not used his.<br/>
He’s been under tight watch from the start.<br/>
If he used it, he’d be noticed. Immediately.<br/>
Motoyasu is currently on Cal Mira Island.<br/>
He may be coming back soon, unfortunately for Firo, and it would be troublesome for me.<br/>
Also, there are Motoyasu’s beloved mass-produced Filorials among the victims.<br/>
If that ridiculous condition was an act, there would be no helping it, but probably not.<br/>
Above all–.<br/>
"Itsuki-sama" (Rishia)<br/>
"The possibility is high." (Naofumi)<br/>
From the fact that Imia’s uncle muttered justice.<br/>
To begin with, I am concerned with what kind of power was used to control Imia’s uncle.<br/>
When I think about it, the missing slaves may be related to this.<br/>
I cannot cover it anymore.<br/>
"Rishia. There are things I need to tell you." (Naofumi)<br/>
"Oh, What is it?" (Rishia)<br/>
"Actually, quite some time ago, I saw Itsuki." (Naofumi)<br/>
"FUE!? ( ふぇえ！? )" (Rishia)<br/>
"Do you remember when we went to buy Atla?" (Naofumi)<br/>
"Yes." (Rishia)<br/>
"At that time, I found Itsuki in the Colosseum. Like some crippled person, he seemed to fight to receive people’s praise." (Naofumi)<br/>
"……" (Rishia)<br/>
Rishia looked down.<br/>
Well… I knew this would happen, but it can’t be helped since I had reasons for hiding it.<br/>
"It looked like Itsuki was lost, and if Rishia were to see such a figure of Itsuki–" (Naofumi)<br/>
"That’s enough. Thank you Naofumi." (Rishia)<br/>
Even if Rishia became estranged here, I cannot stop her.<br/>
"It’s okay. So what happened to Itsuki?" (Rishia)<br/>
"The country’s Shadow was monitoring Itsuki but lost sight of him, so his whereabouts are unknown." (Naofumi)<br/>
"Is… is that so." (Rishia)<br/>
We may already consider this an attack by Itsuki already.<br/>
Don’t come with nastier methods than Ren and Motoyasu.<br/>
