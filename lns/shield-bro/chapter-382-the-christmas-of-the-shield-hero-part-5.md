<br/>
A shorter chapter, so I will release it early. For once, there are no new introductions. Oh yes, before I forget, don’t read if you want spoilers, though not many in this chapter.<br/>
THE CHRISTMAS OF THE SHIELD HERO PART 5<br/>
"Well then… I’m sure you all understand this, but Santa doesn’t visit kids that try to stay up and capture him. Go to sleep." (Naofumi)<br/>
"Niichan is the only one who would try something like that." (Kiel)<br/>
"Fine, just go to sleep!" (Naofumi)<br/>
「Understood」(Children)<br/>
After the Feast I had prepared, the villagers began going off to their beds.<br/>
The time is… Around 9:00 p.m. If I don’t get them to sleep soon, it will be troublesome for me.<br/>
I wonder how Ren’s night went.<br/>
He said something about eliminating monsters and never came back but… Female Knight was present at the feast. Taniko was as well.<br/>
I wonder what he’s doing now.<br/>
"Now then. Raphtalia." (Naofumi)<br/>
"W-What is it?" (Raphtalia)<br/>
"Good children should go to sleep early." (Naofumi)<br/>
"Are you trying to imply that I am still a child?" (Raphtalia)<br/>
Well, yeah. That’s what I’m implying.<br/>
Anyways, aren’t you still a child?<br/>
Raphtalia is still a child in age.<br/>
I have already read her request on the wish slips I had collected. I have already prepared all of the presents<br/>
"What will you do?" (Raphtalia)<br/>
"I’ll also sleep." (Naofumi)<br/>
And so, we turned in early.<br/>
As if. As soon as I confirmed Raphtalia was asleep, I got out of the bed and took out the sack I had prepared.<br/>
(TL: … They are still sleeping in the same bed… Also, that was phrased quite wrongly, but I don’t know how else to say it)<br/>
When I think of what the adults would do to me if I lost it, I sigh.<br/>
"Well then." (Naofumi)<br/>
I take up the bag and leave the house, and find Firo cosplaying as a reindeer. Her eyes are shining as she watches me. She seems to be quite prepared.<br/>
On her chest, a bell is attached. On her feet, even bigger bells are attatched.<br/>
What is up with her appearance.<br/>
"…………." (Naofumi)<br/>
"I’ve been expecting you…" (Firo)<br/>
"Ah. Yes. Yes." (Naofumi)<br/>
I wonder how the fans would see if they saw the world’s idol dressed as this…<br/>
It seems she has tied a fancy sled to her back.<br/>
The sled is covered in red, ornate decorations. Where could she have possibly acquired it?<br/>
"Rafu~" (Rafu)<br/>
Rafu pops his head out of the sled.<br/>
"Ah, This is a ship." (Naofumi)<br/>
"Rafu~" (Rafu)<br/>
Rafu looks at me with pride.<br/>
I see.<br/>
Sleds can be labelled as ships as well.<br/>
This sled definitely has the right atmosphere, at least.<br/>
"Master, get on. Quick!" (Firo)<br/>
"Yes. Yes. I understand." (Naofumi)<br/>
It seems that she has prioritized authenticity.<br/>
I get on the sled thinking to myself, ‘This is going to be troublesome’<br/>
"Then, Were Off!" (Firo)<br/>
Firo starts running and flapping her wings.<br/>
Does she realize that she is still pulling the sled… The sled begins to float.<br/>
Oy! This girl actually managed to prepare a flying sled!<br/>
Shan Shan Shan Shan Shan!<br/>
The bells attached to Firo begin to sound.<br/>
"It’s too loud! The kids will wake up!" (Naofumi)<br/>
"But Imya’s uncle told me this is how Santa is supposed to travel" (Firo)<br/>
"Well… You’re correct, but it’s loud, so take them off." (Naofumi)<br/>
"Are you sure?" (Firo)<br/>
"Rafu~" (Rafu)<br/>
These two seem to be having the time of their lives.<br/>
As we fly, an Aurora-esque trail is left in the sky behind us. (Google Aurora Borealis)<br/>
This was supposed to be a village-limited event. The scale is way too large.<br/>
"Rafu~~!" (Rafu)<br/>
As Rafu barks, the Aurora-esqu trail turns into a cloud that begins showering the village with snow.<br/>
Yes, mood is important. But this snow is a nuisance. I can barely see.<br/>
"Let’s start around Kiel’s house." (Naofumi)<br/>
She wanted food, so I made some candy and for her.<br/>
She loves Crepes, so I assumed she would like other sweet things.<br/>
Should I just put it next to her pillow.<br/>
Firo stops in the airspace above Kiel’s house. (TL: My physics sense is tingling)<br/>
"Why did you stop?" (Naofumi)<br/>
"Eh? Aren’t you going in through the chimney?"<br/>
"I can walk right through Bioplant houses. Stop at the door."<br/>
(TL: As he grew them, they cannot stop him as he is their master)<br/>
"Eh~…" (Firo)<br/>
After some argument, Firo parks next to Kiel’s house.<br/>
「Emergency Exit」<br/>
On my command, a door appears on the Bioplant wall.<br/>
And that’s how I infiltrated Kiel’s house. Making sure to be quiet, I left the candy by her pillow.<br/>
"Alright, on to the next house." (Naofumi)<br/>
"Bu~" (Firo)<br/>
Firo lets out an unsatisfied voice.<br/>
I’d be annoying if I had to go through the chimney every time.<br/>
If Santa existed, I would applaud his patience.<br/>
Now, next is…<br/>
I look at the house next to Kiels.<br/>
…It’s not made of Bioplant.<br/>
I take out the spare key the parents gave me, infiltrate the house and leave a present.<br/>
There is no door I cannot open!<br/>
"Hey, Master." (Firo)<br/>
"Yes?" (Naofumi)<br/>
"You’re acting like a burglar." (Firo)<br/>
"Santa’s pretty much a kind burglar isn’t he? The only one who would walk up to a kid’s pillow would be a parent, or a burglar. And the child gets a toy and is happy, right?"<br/>
"Eh~…" (Firo)<br/>
"Dreams are dreams because you don’t know the reality. I guess this is one more step towards adulthood for you" (Naofumi)<br/>
"Firo doesn’t want to become an adult!" (Firo)<br/>
"I see" (Naofumi)<br/>
Well having dreams is better than having none.<br/>
I think this as well.<br/>
"Now then… Next is Fohl and Atlas, huh." (Naofumi)<br/>
Atlas is currently taking up residence inside of my shield, but she usually sleeps inside of Fohl’s house.<br/>
Well, she doesn’t actually sleep.<br/>
I told her that Santa won’t come if she doesn’t sleep, so she is probably putting her best effort into trying to sleeping.<br/>
I’ll do Atlas first.<br/>
I quietly enter her room.<br/>
She’s doing a very obvious fake sleep.<br/>
If Rafu or Raphtalia did it, it would probably appear cute.<br/>
"Yep, This child is definitely sleeping." (Naofumi)<br/>
I say in a deep voice, as I take the prepared items out of my sack and approach her. I take out another sack<br/>
I don’t think I can get any closer, or Atlas will drag me into the bed with her.<br/>
That’s why I came prepared.<br/>
Atlas cannot see, so she operates by sensing presences.<br/>
I prepare my present is one hand and the sack in the other<br/>
"Naofu-" (Atlas)<br/>
I quickly cover Atlas with my specially prepared sack. (TL: This is going in many bad directions on my mind)<br/>
"Wa, what is this!" (Atlas)<br/>
"Oh, I used materials specially so even spirits can’t pass through them. Atlas, I had already realized you were just fake sleeping. I’ll be capturing you now." (Naofumi)<br/>
"Oh no, Naofumi has captured me! Is this what you call Kidnapping?" (Atlas)<br/>
I tie the bag containing Atlas closed, and leave the room without doing anything.<br/>
This has proven the effect of the ‘spirit capturing’ material.<br/>
Even Atlas cannot escape it.<br/>
Her heart full of the expectation that I will kidnap her, Atlas remains silent.<br/>
"Now then…"<br/>
I go down the hall and arrive at Fohl’s room.<br/>
"z…zzz…..u……..uu…zzz…z"<br/>
Fohl is still in a bear-like hibernation.<br/>
I quietly take an accessory that increases resistance to cold, and carefully put it around his neck. I can feel the bed warm up as I put it on him. I had put all sorts of useful charms on this accessory, making it quit valuable.<br/>
This is because out of the villagers, he has been working especially hard.<br/>
I have especially made his present a useful one… no, I’m just compensating for the share of presents that he would never receive from his parents.<br/>
"su~…"<br/>
His sleeping sounds became slightly more peaceful.<br/>
After that…<br/>
I leave the bag that Atlas was in alone, and put on top of it a pair of gloves I specially made so that spirits cannot pass through them.<br/>
This way, Fohl can now hold her hands.<br/>
I’m planning to make more equipment like this for her later,<br/>
"Ah, Naofumi-sama! Please open me up quickly" (Atlas)<br/>
"Fine, Fine. Well, see you later." (Naofumi)<br/>
"Could this be the so-called Abandonment Play? I’ll wait for you forever!" (Atlas)<br/>
(TL: SM stuff, I will not elaborate)<br/>
Good luck with that.<br/>
By the way, for Atlas, who wished for 「A steamy night with Naofumi」, I have gotten Imya to make a doll in my likeness.<br/>
Imya said he put a special material inside of the stuffed animal, but I wonder what it does.<br/>
"T-this item! It gives off the same presence as Naofumi! How wonderful." (Atlas)<br/>
Atlas seems happy as she hugs the doll.<br/>
(TL: the word used for hug here is not hug. It has a lewder intonation)<br/>
It seems this doll is a suitable replacement for me.<br/>
Now she can spend the entire night with ‘me’.<br/>
Is what I think as I leave more presents for the two of them and leave the house.<br/>
<br/>
