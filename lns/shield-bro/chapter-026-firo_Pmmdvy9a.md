Firo <br/>
 <br/>
The next morning. Raphtalia overslept due to staying up late last night. I groaned with the magic book in one hand. <br/>
Eh? I was brewing medical herbs into medicine. <br/>
While I prepare to leave and regain some time from oversleeping. <br/>
 <br/>
"Ah, it's hatching."(Naofumi) <br/>
 <br/>
I left the egg by a window in the room. Raphtalia noticed that the egg which I bought yesterday started to crack. <br/>
 <br/>
A fluffy wing with feathers could be seen peeking out from the gaps. <br/>
It's trying really hard to be born. <br/>
 <br/>
"Okay."(Naofumi) <br/>
 <br/>
I'm interested in what's going to hatch from the egg. <br/>
I watched the egg as more cracks appear. <br/>
The cracks noisily spread with a PikiPiki sound, the face of a baby demon emerged from the egg. <br/>
 <br/>
"Pii!"(Fledgling) <br/>
 <br/>
With soft, fluffy feathers and eyes of a demon the pink fledgling looked at me with a piece of shell on it's head. <br/>
 <br/>
"Pii!"(Fledgling) <br/>
 <br/>
It jumped cheerfully and collided with my face. <br/>
It wasn't painful at all, and the demon seems to be very energetic despite just being born. <br/>
Although I don't know the race, it seems the physical condition is good and it will grow up well if it's properly taken care of. <br/>
 <br/>
"What kind of demon is this? Is this thing from the Pikyu bird race?(Naofumi) <br/>
 <br/>
Pikyu is a demon that's similar to a condor that cannot fly high due to being deformed. <br/>
I observed the newborn chick's body. <br/>
The body seems more agile than the balloons and I can expect it to attack when it grows up due to it's beak. <br/>
 <br/>
"Hmm... Well I am not familiar with demons."(Raphtalia) <br/>
 <br/>
Raphtalia answers with an embarrassed face. <br/>
 <br/>
"It can't be helped. Should we go ask some villagers?"(Naofumi) <br/>
 <br/>
Because this is a purchased demon, it shouldn't be dangerous to bring around. If there is any trouble, it will obey my commands. <br/>
When I extend my hand to the demon chick, it runs up my hand onto my shoulder and jumps on top of my head to settle down. <br/>
 <br/>
"Piiii"(Fledgling) <br/>
 <br/>
*SuriSuri* slipping from my head to my cheeks <br/>
This is... really cute. <br/>
 <br/>
"Fufu, Naofumi-Sama It must think of you as it's father."(Raphtalia) <br/>
"Oh, it's probably due to imprinting."(Naofumi) <br/>
 <br/>
It might be registered beforehand because the one who moved it first was me, so it must have assumed I am it's parent. <br/>
When I picked up the egg shards, my shield reacted. <br/>
It might informed me what demon this is if I absorb a fragment of the egg. <br/>
Therefore, I let the shield absorb a fragment. <br/>
 <br/>
Requirement for Demon Trainer Shield have been revealed. <br/>
Requirement for Demon Egg Shield have been revealed. <br/>

 <br/>
Demon Egg Shield <br/>
Unsealing completed... Equipment Bonus: Cooking Skill +2 <br/>
 <br/>
...A shield I wasn't expecting came out. I'll change it into Demon Trainer Shield from Slave Trainer 2 Shield because it seems more convenient. <br/>
 <br/>
"Did you discover something?"(Raphtalia) <br/>
"No,but a shield I wasn't expecting came out though."(Naofumi) <br/>
 <br/>
What kind of demon is this young chick? Hopefully the guys from the village will know. <br/>
I thought about where to Level Up today while walking through the village that's in the middle of reconstruction. <br/>
Maybe we could go to the bog area near the western part of the village? I also want to search for a suitable enemy near the North-west mountains. <br/>
I saw a villager that I recognized. <br/>
 <br/>
"Ah, Hero of the Shield-sama."(Villager) <br/>
"Good morning."(Naofumi?) <br/>
"Good morning."(Raphtalia?) <br/>
 <br/>
This was where I was defending last week during the wave, it seems there's a lot of familiar faces here reconstructing the villager. <br/>
 <br/>
"Good morning."(Villager?) <br/>
 <br/>
He bowed his head very deeply. I'm feeling a little embarrassed <br/>
 <br/>
"Pi!"(Fledgling) <br/>
 <br/>
The chick on my head chirps rather cheerfully. <br/>
 <br/>
"Oya?"(Villager) <br/>
 <br/>
The villager looked at the chick on my head. <br/>
 <br/>
"What's wrong?"(Naofumi) <br/>
 <br/>
I pointed at the chick on my head. <br/>
 <br/>
"I bought an egg from a demon dealer."(Naofumi) <br/>
"Aah, I see."(Villager) <br/>
"However, I don't know which demon I bought. Do you guys know what kind of demon this is?"(Naofumi) <br/>
 <br/>
The villagers stared intently at the chick. <br/>
 <br/>
"Let's see...... Do you think that is a Philorial?"(Villager) <br/>
"Eh? The birds who pull carriages?"(Naofumi) <br/>
 <br/>
It would seem I made a little more than the money I paid...... Well, only if what the villagers say is true. <br/>
 <br/>
"Yeah, you can go see check with the ranch near the outskirts of the village."(Villager) <br/>
"Then I'm going to go see."(Naofumi) <br/>
 <br/>
We arrived at the house of the fellow who is managing the ranch. <br/>
The ranch seems have been damaged during the wave, half the bred demons were killed. <br/>
 <br/>
"In short, Is this demon a Philorial?"(Naofumi) <br/>
 <br/>
The ranch man nods when I ask. <br/>
 <br/>
"Let's see. This is a female Philorial."(Ranch man) <br/>
 <br/>
The young chick sits still while the ranch man appraises her. <br/>
 <br/>
"This breed of the Philo Aria Philorial species is good, however unless she pulls a cart she'll be restless."(Ranch man) <br/>
"......What kind of creature is that."(Naofumi) <br/>
"Is there something strange?"(Ranch man) <br/>
 <br/>
Oh, It's not strange if you're born in this world. <br/>
 <br/>
Hmm......I wonder if to these birds the carts are treated as their nest that protects their eggs. <br/>
 <br/>
"Well, at least I didn't lose any money."(Naofumi) <br/>
 <br/>
This isn't bad, when she matures, she'll go for at least 200 silver coins. Quite a good deal for 100 Silvers. <br/>
Though, I don't know how much time and money she will need before maturity. <br/>
 <br/>
"Pi!"(Fledgling) <br/>
 <br/>
The young Philorial chirps on my head. <br/>
 <br/>
"What does this fellow eat?"(Naofumi) <br/>
"In the beginning something soft, like boiled beans. After she matures anything is fine."(Ranch man) <br/>
"I see, Thanks."(Naofumi) <br/>
 <br/>
I'm surprised I can bow and say thanks this easily. <br/>
For now I should looked for boiled beans inside the village. <br/>
 <br/>
"Well, What should we name her?"(Raphtalia) <br/>
 <br/>
Raphtalia asked me while stroking the chick. <br/>
 <br/>
"You're going to name a pet which may be sold?"(Naofumi) <br/>
 <br/>
Well, you will be attached the moment a name is given, and when it is time to sell, you won't be able to. <br/>
 <br/>
"Do I call this Philorial chick all the time?"(Raphtalia) <br/>
"Mu......"(Naofumi) <br/>
 <br/>
This is surely troublesome. <br/>
 <br/>
"Then..... let's call you Firo."(Naofumi) <br/>
"...... So cheap."(Raphtalia) <br/>
"Shut up."(Naofumi) <br/>
"Pi!"(Firo) <br/>
 <br/>
The young chick chirped cheerfully when she understood she was named. <br/>
After we had breakfast we head out to hunt with Firo. <br/>
 <br/>
"Where should we go today?"(Raphtalia?) <br/>
"Pii?"(Firo) <br/>
"Let's see...... A place we can walk to safely."(Naofumi) <br/>
"Okay"(Raphtalia) <br/>
 <br/>
Raphtalia is very reliable. Fights were very easy compared to before. <br/>
Firo is happily chirping on my head. <br/>
It is noisy, but very comfortable. <br/>
 <br/>
When evening approached I noticed some strange sounds. <br/>
There were a lot of unexpected encounters with demons, but they were defeated easily. <br/>
It was probably due to the brand-new weapons and armor. I could defeat enemies coming from the front. <br/>
Today's results are. <br/>
 <br/>
Me Lvl 23 <br/>
Raphtalia Lvl 27 <br/>
Firo Lvl 12 <br/>
 <br/>
Though I hardly fought, I got enough experience for a level, while Firo's Level soared. <br/>
This is good. For young Demi-humans I heard the body grows rapidly when levelling up, it seems demons are the same. <br/>
But......I wondered..... <br/>
Firo's appearance changed considerably. <br/>
Before, Firo was a small chick that could be held with both hands, but now she's big and grown up. <br/>
Well...... Her figure seems to resemble a steamed bun. <br/>
And her feathers grew lighter, the color changed from pink to light pink. <br/>
I stroke the wings slowly for feathers. <br/>
 <br/>
Requirement for Demon Trainer Shield 2 have been released. <br/>
 <br/>
Demon Trainer Shield 2 <br/>
Unsealing completed……Equipment Bonus: Demon Status Correction (Small) <br/>
 <br/>
Still, I noticed Firo's growth when I didn't even notice Raphtalia's. <br/>
 <br/>
"Piyo"(Firo) <br/>
 <br/>
She changed her chirp and is beginning to walk on her own with a pitter-patter, because she's heavy. <br/>
Guuuu...... <br/>
There's an unpleasant premonition from Firo who is constantly chirping. <br/>
Though I bought a little too much feed, it seems grass on the roadside is already a suitable substitution. <br/>
Her appetite is unending......This was the proof of her rapid growth. <br/>
 <br/>
"Umm...Naofumi-sama..."(Raphtalia) <br/>
"I understand. Demons are amazing."(Naofumi) <br/>
 <br/>
To grow so much in one day...It's only a matter of time before she can be rode. <br/>
Though her body is strong, it's a little scary that her mind will be immature. <br/>
Therefore I performed a considerably severe limitation. <br/>
I returned to the hotel and showed the storekeeper Firo and asked where I can put her. <br/>
Afterwards, we were guided to the stable of the hotel and substituted straw for a nest. <br/>
 <br/>
"Hm? The meat and bone of the Chimera are put here."(Naofumi) <br/>
 <br/>
It seems this place hasn't been corrupted yet so the materials will rot slower. <br/>
 <br/>
"For the time being, I am waiting for it to soften so it will be easier to process."(Villager) <br/>
"Eh....."(Naofumi) <br/>
 <br/>
It isn't for food, does that make it easier to process and handle? <br/>
 <br/>
"After that, I'll make dried meat and look for buyers.I am still looking forward to selling them. It seems a few mages are coming."(Villager) <br/>
"That's good."(Naofumi) <br/>
 <br/>
Because it was quite a big chimera, there seems to be a lot of stock. It's probably around 2 cows. <br/>
It is inedible, but there are many who still want to research it. <br/>
This will be a place to acquire it. <br/>
 <br/>
"Piyo"(Firo) <br/>
 <br/>
Guu...... <br/>
Are you still hungry? <br/>
Though I got additional feed in the village and fed her, it still doesn't seem to be enough. <br/>
Where does it all go? <br/>
Biki ...... BikiBiki ...... <br/>
Is that the sound of meat and bones creaking? You're still growing up? <br/>
 <br/>
"To grow up so much in one day...... That's pretty unreasonable" <br/>
 <br/>
The shopkeeper watches my face anxiously. <br/>
 <br/>
"She is still Lvl 12."(Naofumi) <br/>
"Eh? 12?"(Villager) <br/>
 <br/>
The storekeeper is surprised at my answer. <br/>
 <br/>
"I think It is necessary to be around 20 and needs a few days to grow up but as expected of the power of a Hero-sama"(Villager) <br/>
 <br/>
Hmm... There is the possibility of Demon Growth Correction (Small) having an influence. <br/>
It changes every time I check her status. What growth. <br/>
I still can't send her to battle yet. <br/>
 <br/>
"Piyo"(Firo) <br/>
 <br/>
Firo who is growing up quickly and healthily chirps. <br/>
After I petted Firo to confirm if she's asleep, I head back to Raphtalia and my room. I study this world's letters afterwards. <br/>
The problem is that there are too many letters in this language.
