    <p>Thank you, everyone, for purchasing the seventh volume of 『Cooking with Wild Game』.</p>

    <p>If the book goes on sale according to schedule, half a year of 2016 should have passed by now.</p>

    <p>The speed that time goes by surprises me every time.</p>

    <p>And during this time, the seventh volume of this series has been published successfully.</p>

    <p>This is thanks to the support and care of all the readers, and I wish to express my deepest gratitude to everyone.</p>

    <p>Because there was too much content for this volume, I had to edit the drafts by a lot.</p>

    <p>The story didn’t change too much, but I actually cut away roughly 60 pages of the original draft. This is the first time I compressed the content by that much.</p>

    <p>Since the number of pages exceeded the norm by this much, you might think that splitting this into two volumes would be easier. However, I prefer to end this story in just this one volume.</p>

    <p>Compressing the passages is both joyful and sad. I pray that going through this arduous and happy process will bring about better results.</p>

    <p>The mid-meal snack is centered around Leina Wu.</p>

    <p>I wrote a lot of side stories for the other characters, but this is the first time I let Leina Wu take center stage.</p>

    <p>On second thought, aside from Rimee Wu in the first volume, I had not written any side stories for the Wu clan main house four sisters yet. They were central figures in the stories, so it was hard for me to write about them.</p>

    <p>I will want to feature the other Wu clan sisters as the main character in the future so everyone will have a chance to read a side story about Vena Wu and Lala Wu.</p>

    <p>Two innkeepers are illustrated this time.</p>

    <p>For readers who like old men, this must be a joyous occasion.</p>

    <p>Aside from them, I also asked the illustrator sensei to draw a middle-aged man who made his debut in this volume, but we had to give it up because of the page planning of the book. In the next volume… he won’t make an appearance either. The author hopes he will get to be in the limelight one day.</p>

    <p>And so, the next book is volume 8.</p>

    <p>To avoid spoilers, I won’t mention the story, but the author had a lot of fun writing volume 8.</p>

    <p>The 6th and 7th volumes are more serious so the readers can look forward to a cheery story. The atmosphere won’t be too different, but the content is more warming.</p>

    <p>The story structure will resemble episodic short stories. The posts I’m publishing recently is done in a similar way too.</p>

    <p>The content isn’t too different from before, so do look forward to the next volume’s development.</p>

    <p>Let me add some additional information. As there are plenty of pages in the next book, I might insert a side story I published online, or write tens of pages of new side story like I did for volume 2. I’m still considering both options.</p>

    <p>Finally, I will sign off with the usual thanking of my editor from HOBBY JAPAN, the illustrator Kochimo-sensei, all the staff who helped in the publishing of this volume, and all the readers who bought this book. Thank you, everyone.</p>

    <p>I hope to meet everyone in the next volume!</p>

    <p>May 2016, EDA</p>
