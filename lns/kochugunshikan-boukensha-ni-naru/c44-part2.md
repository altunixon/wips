In the data update Iris sent me, info on the Commerce Guild was included as well. The Commerce Guild actually offers a service of depositing and withdrawing money from their branches. So people can actually send and receive money through different branches within the continent. There’s a service fee of five thousand Guineas every time one sends money though.   So one can deposit some money along with the corresponding fee to a local Commerce Guild branch, and other people authorized to access said money will be able to withdraw them from another branch, even if that branch is located far away. <br/>
“That’s a great idea, Alan! It is true that we do not need that much money. And if we successfully manage to become high ranking adventurers, I’m sure we’ll be able to make plenty of earnings. We will be getting quite a lot of money eventually. Let us do as you suggested!”<br/>
We then discussed the amount of remittance Roberto will be receiving periodically. Roberto and his men will be making Cecilio kingdom, which is quite close to the Alois Kingdom, as their base of operations. <br/>
We eventually managed to finish all things we needed to discuss and went to the inn the rest of the royal guards were staying at. <br/>
It seems the rest of the guards were eagerly waiting for us as well. We gathered inside the large room we used last time. <br/>
“Everyone, Her Royal Highness has words to convey to you all. Be sure to listen attentively!”<br/>
After Captain Dalshim’s words, the rest of the royal guards got on one knee in a gesture of fealty.  <br/>
“Everyone, I shall first tell you about the things I did not manage to convey yesterday. Thank you all, for persevering and finding me. I feel truly sorry for all of the suffering you must have undergone in order to find me, but I am honestly glad to be able to meet you all once again.” <br/>
“We are undeserving of such words. It was part of our sworn duty to search for Your Highness. We do not need such thanks.” Captain Dalshim respectfully replied. <br/>
“I am gladdened by your unwavering loyalty, everyone. As you well know, the Starveek Kingdom is no more, and I am no longer a royal princess. You all have already fulfilled your duties enough. And there is no need to continue serving me as well. I am sure some of you may feel the want to come back to your home towns. The ones who want to return can freely relieve yourselves of your duties as part of the royal guards. I do not mind.”<br/>
“Your Highness, the ones gathered here have already strengthened their resolve. None of us wish to return to our home towns. We shall serve Your Highness until our last breaths.” <br/>
“I see… However, some of the men staying at Cecilio Kingdom may have different views. If you can, please confirm things with each and everyone of them.”<br/>
“…Certainly.” <br/>
“That goes for you as well, Roberto.”<br/>
“By your will.”<br/>
“Well then, I shall now discuss our future plans. Everyone, we have decided to create a new country!”<br/>
“””Oooh!”””<br/>
“The place we will be using as our base for this plan of creating a new country will be completed in one year’s time. After it is completed, we shall all move there and build up our strength. <br/>
Of course, we cannot hope to successfully create a country with our current numbers. And so, we plan on attaining nobility in this kingdom of Belta first. <br/>
Once we have attained a nobility and conferred a fief, we will then be able to increase the number of our allies. Once we have managed to build sufficient strength, we shall declare our independence, move to the creation of a new state, and eventually aim for hegemony over the entire continent.” <br/>
“””Ooooh!!!”””<br/>
“Of course, all of this will not be easy to achieve. Instead, it can even be called reckless, or even crazy.<br/>
But we have decided to stake our all on this dream. If you all feel that you can work toward fulfilling this dream as well, then I bid you to follow us. <br/>
I also intend to take back the Starveek Kingdom as long as I still draw breath.<br/>
Once we do so, you all will be considered my oldest, and most loyal vassals. At the very least, I shall confer you the rank of baron for your services.”<br/>
“””Oooooh!!!”””<br/>
“I shall follow you to the ends of the earth, Your Royal Highness!” <br/>
“I as well!”<br/>
“Let us do it, Royal Highness!” <br/>
“Aaah! I have been waiting for this!”<br/>
“We have already conveyed the details to Captain Dalshim and Roberto. Please think things over carefully and decide.” <br/>
“””By your will!”””<br/>
“Our princess shall be serving as an adventurer here at the Belta kingdom. We of the royal guard shall serve to assist her in her endeavors. We shall now head back to the Cecilio kingdom and bring the rest of the royal guards back here, and join up with Her Highness once more.”<br/>
“Captain, isn’t there a need to leave a number of us as Her Highness’ guards?” <br/>
“No, there is a need to guard the funds Alan-dono has entrusted to Baron Sergio.”<br/>
“I shall no longer require guards from now onwards. I plan on becoming strong enough to no longer require any guards. If I cannot do so, I feel that I do not have the qualifications to lead you all.”<br/>
“”Ooh!””<br/>
“Well then, we shall go first and journey toward the Great Demon Forest. I wish you well on your journey, everyone.”<br/>
“””Oooh!”””<br/>
The royal guards seemed to have a new spring in their steps as they prepared for their departure. <br/>
Since they were all busy with the preparations, we went out of the inn and headed to Tarus-sans mansion. <br/>
“Everyone seemed really into it.”<br/>
“Well, of course they are. It’s hard to keep one’s composure if you’re suddenly told you have the chance to become a baron or better after all.” Elna explained. <br/>
“But Elna and the rest of the royal guards are nobles, right?”<br/>
“Even if we are, most nobles who have joined the knight order are actually not the ones first in line for inheriting our house. No, in reality, we have next to no chance of becoming heirs.” <br/>
“I see. So that’s the case. So you also want to become a baron or something, Elna?”<br/>
“No. I only wish to serve at Cleria-samas side.”<br/>
“Do not hold yourself back, Elna. If it’s you, then becoming a countess is more than possible.” Cleria interjected. <br/>
“If it was up to me, I would instead rather aim to become the leader of a new order of royal guards.”<br/>
“That’s just like you, Elna. I honestly cannot say I approve.”  <br/>
When we reached Tarus-san’s mansion, we found Willy in front of the gates, so we called out to him. <br/>
“Hey there, Willy. Is Tarus-san home?”<br/>
“Good morning, Alan-san. He is. Please wait for a moment.”<br/>
Tarus-san went out of the mansion soon afterward. Jonas-san was with him as well.<br/>
“It’s nice to see you all again. It’s not good to continue standing here. Please go ahead and come to my office.”<br/>
We were then led to Tarus-san’s office and served some tea. They’ve always managed to serve us tea right away whenever we visit. Do they always have warm water ready for guests? <br/>
“Now that I got a good look at you all, it seems that your number has increased once again. Are they your new comrades?”<br/>
“That’s right. They are also adventurers and members of our party. Their names are Selena and Sharon.” <br/>
“I’m Sharon. It’s nice to make your acquaintance.” <br/>
“I’m Selena. Pleased to meet you.”<br/>
“We’re sorry for coming on short notice, but something important came up unexpectedly, and it was decided that we are to leave this city soon. That’s why we came for a visit. Oh, but the magic tools I promised you will be delivered on the scheduled date, of course. And I will also talk to the Magic Guild in order to entrust them with the maintenance and repairs. So there’s no need to worry.”<br/>
I’d have to leave the maintenance of the dryers to the chief later. I’ll pay them a visit later as well.<br/>
“Oh, so that’s the case. It is quite unfortunate. Can I at least ask for the reason?”<br/>
“We have decided to finally become active as adventurers. We were planning on journeying toward the Great Demon Forest.”<br/>
“I see. If you really are planning on becoming first rate adventurers, then that certainly is the perfect place to raise your ranks. But it really is unfortunate. I was thinking of having Alan-san’s help with some things actually. But now…”<br/>
“Do you have requests? Can I ask what they are?”<br/>
“Well, I and Jonas were thinking we would be able to cooperate with Alan-san to develop a lot more new, never-before-seen magic tools you see.”<br/>
“I see. So that’s what it is. Well, the Great Demon Forest isn’t that far from here anyway. We can still stay in contact with each other, so I’ll give you a heads up whenever I come up with something from now on.” <br/>
“Oh! Is that so!? Well then, it would be most welcome if we can receive a letter or two from you once you have settled down there.” <br/>
“I understand. I’ll do so.” <br/>
