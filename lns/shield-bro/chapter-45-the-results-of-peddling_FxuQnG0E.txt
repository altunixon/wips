This was quite a long chapter, and it took me a while......
As always, Enjoy~

Chapter 45. 

The results of peddling
 
This is a curse, isn't it?

After hurrying back to the village, I got Raphtalia to see the healers about her burns that I had caused.

Healer: "Even so, this kind is quite strong. The dragon corpse on the mountain had a curse that was this strong?"

Naofumi: "Eh... No... That is..."

Wondering how I was going to answer, I stammered.

Raphtalia: "Yes, I made a mistake and was accidentally burned by the dragon."

Raphtalia smiled while looking in my direction as if to say it was a secret.

Naofumi: "Can you do anything about it? If it's money, I'll pay whatever you need"

Raphtalia is a girl after all. If she has black marks like this, she would stand out which would be troublesome.

Healer: "It's not that it's impossible, but..."

During the preparation, the healers bring a bottle of transparent liquid to the room.

Healer: "It is quite powerful. It could heal her soon..."
Naofumi: "What is that?"
Healer: "It's holy water. To cure a curse, it's best to use holy power..."
Naofumi: "I see"

It seems the injuries would be slow to heal due to the effect of the curse shield until fully healed.

That is very dangerous.
There is no clear distinction between friend and foe. In addition, there is a counter effect on allies.
I can't even think about using it.

Also, after looking at the shield tree, the unsealing wasn't progressing at all.
It was only for a short time, but I cannot unseal that shield. I remember having that sort of hunch.

Healer: "Soak the holy water into the bandage..."

The healers apply the holy water soaked bandage to Raphtalia's blackened wounds.

Healer: "Sorry it's so simple for now. Please use powerful holy water made by the church in a large town if possible."

Naofumi: "How much will it heal?"

Healer: "To be honest... it's a fairly strong curse. Whether it can be truly cured... when it comes to the work of dragons..."

The truth is that I did it though. But to think the curse was so powerful that it could be considered the work of a dragon...

Naofumi: "Oh right. How much more medicine will be needed?"

(Tl note: all of above is translated by MIZUHOCHAN so all credit goes to him/her, I am merely copy/pasta and mtling the rest)
(Tl note: Healer = Treatment master.)

Treatment Master: "This is all I can do for now. Saint-sama, please help the people who are suffering from the illness."
Naofumi: "Okay"

I left Raphtalia in the room with the Treatment master and head to the building where they gather the sick.
As expected of medicine made by a professional.
The sickness that could not be cured with my treatment medicine was easily cured by this.
I felt relieved looking at the sick people breathing calmly in their sleep.
…… I want strength, but not from relying on that kind of shield.
Saving someone from sickness is significant, but I still curse my weakness.
There may come a time where even Firo could get hurt. Thankfully, she was fine this time.
My head blanked in an instant when I thought she died.
I've thought this many times. This world is not a game.
Nobody will revive if they die.
I watch the graveyard behind the isolation facility deep in thought.
I was betrayed and swindled----But I want to protect the people who believe in me no matter what.
I returned to the Treatment room and spoke to Raphtalia who is wrapped in bandages.

Naofumi: "I'm sorry"
Raphtalia: "It's alright"
Naofumi: "But....."
Raphtalia: "I was afraid. Afraid that Naofumi-sama went somewhere far away."
Naofumi: "Eh?"
Raphtalia: "That power, it's trying to drag Naofumi-sama somewhere. That's what I feel. Therefore, this is a cheap price to pay if I was able to stop Naofumi-sama."

Raphtalia's laughing expression pierces my heart.
I must absolutely protect her. With determination, I swear not to lose to that shield.

Naofumi: "Raphtalia, is your sickness cured?"
Raphtalia: "It should be alright for now……"
Naofumi: 'Next time I administer medicine, stay close to me. It will serve as prevention."
Raphtalia: "Okay"

Thus, we slept in the village that day.
We worked on the extermination of the epidemic as hard as possible on the next day.
I asked the treatment master if I could help make the medicine and the work was completed earlier than scheduled.
I wanted to learn, but I felt something inside me that was interfering.
(Tl note: I'm a little confused with this 教わろうかと思ったが今の俺ではかえって邪魔になる気がした。)
People suffering from illness disappeared and the village becomes peaceful again.

Raphtalia: "Where will we peddle next? Did you ask the treatment master on how to make medicine?"

Procuring holy water for Raphtalia is top-priority now, but I do want to learn how to make High Class medicine.

Raphtalia: "Naofumi-sama? Won't the wave start soon?"

Eh!?
That reminds me.
What Raphtalia says return me from my thoughts.
I hastily open the arrival prediction window.
There are only 3 and a half days left!

Naofumi: "This is bad! We only have a little over 3 days remaining!"

Preparations will be insufficient.

Naofumi: "Firo, let's hurry to the castle town!"
Firo: "Roger~"
Village Chief:"Uhmm Saint-sama…this……"

I was presented a bag full of money by the village chief.

Village Chief: "Saint-sama this is the money you asked for. Please accept it."

Come to think of it, my real identity is still hidden.

Naofumi: "Yeah……"

I receive the bag of money and count how much is inside.
……I put half in another bag and return it

Village Chief: "Eh?"
Naofumi: "It wasn't my power alone. This is for the outstanding treatment master who is in this village. Hand it to him."
Village Chief: "O-okay……"

Yup, it would have been really dangerous this time if that treatment master was not here.
Because just suppressing the illness is already my limit.
That person contributed just as much.

Naofumi: "See ya."
Village Chief: "Ah, thank you very much!"

The group of villagers saw us off together.
When these guys know my real identity, will they look at me in disgust?
It's a complicated feeling.
I stow it away in the corner of my head, because there are preparations to be made.
I can't care about the condition of the carriage at a time like this!
We rushed to the castle town.
There was a rumour about a carriage that was roaring down the road with frightening speed after that day.

On the way.

Firo: "Master~ something is-"
Naofumi: "Hm?"

I come out of the carriage.

Wild Philorial A appears!
Wild Philorial B appears!
Wild Philorial C appears!

Wild Philorials:"""Gua!?"""

Firo looked at the Philorial with an astonished expression.
Philorial A, B and C looked at Firo with the same expression and ran away.

Naofumi: "What was that?"

Running away right when encountering……
That is the behaviour pattern of rare monsters that have delicious experiences points and money.
Though, I can't expect a lot of experience from Philorials in such a place.
Maybe they were just surprised to see a Philorial Queen and ran away.

Firo: "What an appetizing bird. Whenever we pass someone, they have one."
Naofumi: "They are from the same family as you."

I noted that Firo is licking her lips. Is there anything this fellow doesn't see as food?
It is scary that she is likely to perform cannibalism 

Firo: "Master, if we chase now we can still kill them~"
Naofumi: "……Stop it."

It's still not too late now?
This fellow has no sense of tension at all.
That reminds me, I did not check our lvl after the fight with the zombie dragon.

Me Lvl 38
Raphtalia Lv 40 ★
Firo Lv 40 ★

★...... Star?

Naofumi: "Hey, do you guys know of the star next to your lvls?"

I have a bad feeling. What could it be?

Raphtalia: "No……"
Firo: "Firo has no idea"

Hmm..... Let's see, Help.
……I don't understand it.
I can't find anything on the ★.

At long last, we arrived at the castle town.

Naofumi: "Let's go to the old man and get some weapons and armour to prepare for the wave"

After a long absence, the old man from the weapons shop just watches us with a hand on the middle of his forehead and seems to be lost in thought.

Old Man: "Hey lad, don’t just appear so suddenly."
Naofumi: “Don’t you know sudden events go hand in hand with business?"
Old Man: "Well, that's true. So, what's your budget?"
Naofumi: "Let's see"

I put my month's earnings on the counter in front of the old man. It's about four large bags of money.

Naofumi: "This is all the silver coins."
Old Man: "Count properly lad! How did you make such a killing!?"
Naofumi: "Hahaha, this is the result of peddling"
Old Man: "Seriously…… What a surprising hobby for you to have"
Naofumi: "It's not unfortunate."
Old Man: "Well, did you count how much there is?"
Naofumi: "Uhh"

The contents of the money bags were counted by Raphtalia, the old man and me.

Old Man: "So, how did the missy get injured?"

The old man points at Raphtalia while counting money.

Raphtalia: "Uhh, earlier I received a powerful curse attack by a powerful demon."

I stop counting and looked at Raphtalia.

Old Man: "Ah, yea curses are troublesome. Did you get any treatment?"
Naofumi: "Yeah, after this we will go buy some holy water at the church."
Old Man: "I see"

Why are you lying……? Is it because it's a curse that I gave?
Phew.

Naofumi: "After buying equipment, can I request a carriage made of metal?"
Old Man: "Don’t order anything from me lad"
Naofumi: "You can't do it?"
Old Man: "Well…… I'm familiar with dealing with metal"

Though it may look like a lot, but there is surprisingly little after being converted from silver coins.

Old Man: "This is equivalent to 70 gold coins! Lad, your earnings are tremendous"
Naofumi: "I am aware of my business talents"

Though I'm not sure if I actually possess such talents, I am conceited.
I feel like I have done a few things similar to merchants of death.

Naofumi: "Oh right, there is various equipments taken off of thieves."

I gave instructions to Firo who has been restless within the goods store and told her to bring in the various armours from the carriage.

Naofumi: "This is for trade-ins"
Old Man: "Lad, this is too much"
Naofumi: "How much equipment can I get with only this much?"
Old Man: "Let's see…… The missy can get a new weapon and you can get some gauntlets."

The old man is rather impressive and I start to think.

Old Man: "I am thankful that you're favouring my shop, but go to another shop to trade-in."
Naofumi: "What do you mean?"
Old Man: "Recently, the other heroes haven't been seen, so you could go check out the other excellent shops."
Naofumi: "Hmmm......"

I haven't considered that. Because they have knowledge from games, the possibility of knowing where they can get better equipment than from the old man shop is quite high.
Let's assume that the best shop in this city is the old man's…… Are they somewhere in another country?

Naofumi: "Do you have any idea?"
Old Man: "There might be something in the neighbouring country."
Naofumi: "Your shop is good enough, I'd rather not waste time on speculations."
Old Man:"Lad......"
Naofumi: "Even the worse weapons and armours I've seen you make are quite good. Is that a skill?"
Old Man: "What are you saying! I was a disciple of a master craftsman in the east when I was young."
Naofumi: "Exactly. I'll be in your care because it's efficient."
Old Man: "Lad. I understand. I'll live up to your expectations!"

The old man left the counter and started browsing the wares in his own shop.

Old Man: "Let's see…… For the missy, a High class magic sword should be adequate. Needless to say the Blood Clean coating will be applied after it's completed."

It cost 10 gold. Of course there were some trade-ins included in the 10 gold.

Old Man: "Next is magic silver armour that has a magic defence within an appropriate range."
Naofumi: "Magic Defence?"
Old Man: "The process of absorbing the magical power of the wielder to boost defence."
Naofumi: "I see."

I want to make Raphtalia's defence as high as it can because there is a possibility I could hurt Raphtalia.
The old man moves 10 pieces of gold again. It's quite expensive.
But......

Naofumi: "Hey, isn't there better equipment that I can buy?"
Old Man: "The metal carriage and the missy's treatment will be quite expensive. Also, it is absurd to have equipment that doesn't balance with you."
Naofumi: "That makes sense."
Old Man: "This is also the limit for equipment around here for now."
Naofumi: "Ah, so that's why."

I'll take the old man's word for it if the equipment is good enough.

Old Man: "From here on out it needs to be custom-made. Come back later."
Naofumi: "So for the trouble, but the wave comes in 3 days, will it be done in time?"
Old Man: "I won't have enough time if I have to procure the materials."

……that's what I figured.

Old Man:"I already have various materials, but it's not enough."
Naofumi: "Well…… Can you use the skin of a decaying dragon?"
Old Man: "That's not a problem, what are you going to do lad?"
Naofumi: "What am I going to do?"

Old Man: "I can lighten the heavy equipment because you prefer it, and I can make new equipment with any materials you bring."
Naofumi: "By the way, will the performance be good?"
Old Man: "It can be done easily, the durability will be good too."

Naofumi: "Hmm..... by the way, would the performance go up if you add bone to the armour? Similar to the armour of the savage tribes."
Old Man:"Ah, I was going to recommend that. Chimera and Dragon materials are amazing! It would be perfect to protect the core of the armour with dragon skin too."

The core of the armour was that souvenir from Firo and a certain dragon. It seems it will become some good armour.

Naofumi: "Then…… can I order it?"
Old Man: "Thanks for business, there will be extra fees for processing costs and material charges."

After saying so, the old man moves another 5 pieces of gold and takes the materials to the inner part of the counter.

Old Man: "I can put the bone armour onto what you already have equipped."
Naofumi: "Okay"

I go to the changing room to change and put the armour on the counter.

Firo: "Master is just like a villager"
Naofumi: "Shut up"

This bird has a foul mouth.

Firo: "Hey Hey, What about Firo?"
Naofumi: "You're getting a new carriage"

I made the arrangements with the old man for a metal carriage. It was quite costly.
It cost me 10 gold coins.
Well, there were some bonuses added in.

Firo: "Firo wants armour like Raphtalia Onee-san and Master~"
Naofumi: "No"
Firo: "I want it! I want it! I want it!"

I'm pretty frustrated by this bird's whining.

Old Man: "Don't be like that lad. I'll do you a favour and lend you the equipment for that little bird missy"
Naofumi: "You see......"

I tell him this fellow's offensive ability already surpasses Raphtalia and that's with her bare hands.
That is already sufficient.

Naofumi: "Is there anything?"
Old Man: "Hmm. Does the Bird missy usually fight in her Demon form?"
Naofumi: "Yeah"
Old Man: "Well then that's outside of my jurisdiction. It's not impossible to acquire equipment from demon shops though."
Naofumi: "Demon trader......"

I am reminded of that nasty smile. The gentleman in my imagination.

Old Man: "Do you need me to introduce you?"
Naofumi: "No, I know someone."

Should we go meet him?

Old Man: "Then..... Come back two days later for the equipment."
Naofumi: 'Okay. So…… Old man"
Old Man: "What's up?"
Naofumi: "Do you know about the stars attached next to a Lvl?"

Old Man:"Oh? Did you get strong enough to Class-up?"
Naofumi: "Class up?"
Old Man:"The lad doesn't know? The class up is a growth limit breakthrough. When levels are raised to their limit, a class up can be done, after that power can rise even further."

What was that!?
In other words, it's a rite of passage for a job change in gaming terms.
Unless a Class up is performed, they can't get stronger?

Old Man: "Originally, if you are a knight loyal to the country or a magician adventurer, you can get a class up. But will you be granted one as a Hero?"

When I think about it, it was no wonder thief groups were so weak. The highest Lv is 40. Using the fact that, unworthy adventurers and villages cannot class up, power is managed.
The reason is that if the country does not deem you trustworthy a class up is not granted……

Old Man: "There are worries as to what direction to take during a class up…… But if you get a star, then all the possibilities are open."
Naofumi: "......Where can I class up?'
Old Man: "It can be done in at the Hourglass of the Dragon's era."

You can do it in such a place? No wonder the management was so strict.
…… Then meeting the other heroes there, Was it because of Class up?
I wonder what their Levels are.
As expected, I feel irritated.

Naofumi: "Then I'm going to head out"

If it's possible, I should do it as quickly as I can.
We left the weapon shop and hurry to the Hourglass of the Dragon's era.
Because our carriage has reached its limit, we left it at the back of the weapon shop.
Firo is in human form.

Raphtalia: "What are we going to do?"
Naofumi: "Um......"

Every day, I feel that there is some kind of weird atmosphere in the inn.
(tl note: Not sure what this means　毎日、宿屋で見ているはずなのに、何か珍しい構図になってしまっているような気がする。)
It seems there were many people with birds similar to this fellow.
That would be the result.

Naofumi: "Now that I think about it, what exactly does class up expand?"
Raphtalia: "I want to Class up as per Naofumi-sama's request."
Naofumi: "......Stop that. Raphtalia, you must decide your own possibility yourself."

In the games of old, the class change would let you choose between a light route and a dark route, the person in question has to make the choice themselves.

Naofumi: "When the wave is over and I return to my own world, you must live for yourself."
Raphtalia: "Eh…… Naofumi-sama will go back?"
Naofumi: "Yeah"

I have no attachments to this world either. There are people that I want to repay, but I will do that by saving the world.
I do not wish to remain in such an unpleasant world.

Raphtalia: "Can you take me with you?"
Naofumi: "Where?"

Where would you stay? If someone like Raphtalia comes to my world, it would look strange.

Firo: "Firo wants to go too. Where are you going?"
Naofumi: "Firo is impossible......"
Firo: "Really?"
Naofumi: "Oh well. Firo what class up do you want?"
Firo: "Firo wants to be able to spit poison~!"
Naofumi: "............"

I was at a loss for words. All I can muster is. What is up with this bird?
Was it that? Recently we've been fighting a lot of demons that had the ability to use poison.
Like that Bio Plant and Zombie dragon.

Naofumi: "You’re already poisonous enough"

By that I mean your tongue.

Firo: "Really!?"

Firo exhales and checks her breath.

Firo: "It's not coming out?"
Naofumi: "That's not what I meant. Anyways, let's go."

As for us, we head to the Hourglass of the Dragon's era full of expectations.
