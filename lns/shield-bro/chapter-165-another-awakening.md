Chapter 165: Another Awakening<br/>
The inn we stayed at didn’t include food, so we all, Motoyasu included, went off to the bar.<br/>
As soon as we step in, Motoyasu rushes over to the counter and orders some alcohol. And he hangs his head while downing it at an alarming rate.<br/>
He really has nothing but women on his head, this one. When he loses them, this is the inevitable result.<br/>
Some people who don’t realize his identity try to converse with him, but he brushes them aside.<br/>
"Ara, do you want to have a drink with this Onee-san?" (Older Woman)<br/>
"… I’m sorry. I kinda want to drink alone now. Please don’t mind me." (Motoyasu)<br/>
He even brushes away the females.<br/>
This may be more serious than I thought.<br/>
Bitch was always like that. Did you really believe in her that much?<br/>
The rest of us order dinner.<br/>
Though I don’t really think that a bar should have good food, after asking around, I found that this bar had the best taste in town.<br/>
The servings are also quite large and the price isn’t that high.<br/>
And after having her fill of good food, the Human-form Firo begins to sing along with the bar’s bard.<br/>
The egg on my back is a nuisance. I try to stay inconspicuous.<br/>
"Young girl, let’s sing another one!" (Bard)<br/>
"Sure, let’s go~!" (Firo)<br/>
Firo starts singing with an unnerving amount of energy. Her voice is quite good.<br/>
She gets carried away and begins singing a strange tune. It sounds like an Anime song.<br/>
It might be my imagination… but the people in front of the stage seem to have a strange look in their eyes.<br/>
"… Naofumi-sama, I’ve heard that there is a type of monster that uses its singing voice to lead ships astray at sea." (Rafatalia)<br/>
"What a coincidence, I was thinking of that monster as well." (Naofumi)<br/>
The people listening to the song seem to be mesmerized, as if they were being bewitched by the Sirens.<br/>
After Firo finally finishes her song, the establishment is shaken by an explosive cheer from the crowd.<br/>
Quite a few people call for an encore, but it seems Firo got bored. She shouts, ‘No!’ and gets off the stage.<br/>
She’s become quite popular, and some people are handing her bouquets of flowers.<br/>
Someone also hands her a vegetable that looks like a carrot. Firo stares at it and licks her lips. After seeing this, numerous people begin giving her food.<br/>
I don’t know if she’s lost her mind, but Firo, carrying a mountain of gifts, goes over and sits down next to Motoyasu.<br/>
"What’s wrong? You’re not energetic like usual. What happened?" (Firo)<br/>
"…" (Motoyasu)<br/>
Motoyasu directs an annoyed glance at Firo.<br/>
He’s even acting this way towards his beloved human-form Firo. This truly is serious.<br/>
"Are you hungry? If you’re hungry, you won’t feel good. Do you want me to sing a song to give you energy?" (Firo)<br/>
Firo makes her way back to the stage, and starts singing again.<br/>
It’s quite an upbeat song. Almost as if…<br/>
"Firo knows quite a few songs. I never knew." (Naofumi)<br/>
"Well we did travel around a lot. She loves to sing, you know." (Rafatalia)<br/>
Firo stares out Motoyasu as she sings. She also begins dancing.<br/>
Just looking at her seems to give me energy. It sounds like a song from that one anime with a transforming plane. (TL: According to the comments, this is a Macross reference. I’m off to go watch it.)<br/>
The song ends, and Firo goes back to Motoyasu’s side.<br/>
"Please, just ignore me." (Motoyasu)<br/>
"Ye\~s" (Firo)<br/>
Is what she says. She starts rummaging through the various items she received.<br/>
"Eat this. It always gives me energy." (Firo)<br/>
Motoyasu finally takes the food and flowers presented to him.<br/>
Firo is acting out of pure curiosity right now.<br/>
Her interest was probably peaked upon seeing the usually-energetic Motoyasu acting this down.<br/>
Wha?<br/>
"U, UWAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA!?" (Motoyasu)<br/>
Motoyasu lets out a cry and suddenly clings to Firo.<br/>
"NYAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA!?" (Firo)<br/>
And Firo lets out a surprised cry that doesn’t lose to his.<br/>
And she begins twisting her body to get out of Motoyasu’s grasp, but Motoyasu uses all of his power to prevent her escape.<br/>
"U…uuuuuuuu…" (Motoyasu)<br/>
Motoyasu seriously starts crying.<br/>
"Master! Save me!" (Firo)<br/>
Firo is also crying as she looks at me for help.<br/>
… Is he an idiot?<br/>
"What the hell are you doing?" (Naofumi)<br/>
I approach the two to save Firo, but Motoyasu suddenly presses his head into Firo’s chest and sobs harder.<br/>
Since Witch was no good, he turned to Firo?<br/>
No… Motoyasu has been showing interest in Firo for a long time.<br/>
"Return to your original form. Motoyasu will probably let go." (Naofumi)<br/>
"G-got it!" (Firo)<br/>
Motoyasu should have a trauma for Firo’s original form.<br/>
He never approaches her when she looks like that.<br/>
Firo transforms as per my request.<br/>
The people in the bar begin screaming in surprise but I ignore it.<br/>
However.<br/>
"Super… Firo-chan’s smell… Sniff…Sniff…" (Motoyasu)<br/>
… Motoyasu continues to hold onto monster-form Firo, and takes in her scent.<br/>
How indecent!<br/>
"He’s not letting go! He’s not letting go, master!" (Firo)<br/>
He’s not even backing off from Monster-form Firo!?<br/>
How could this be! Wait, I can imagine his reasons.<br/>
"He’s like this because you offered kind words to him when he was depressed! Take responsibility, and look after him." (Naofumi)<br/>
"Wait a second. Using that logic, Naofumi-sama has to look after me!" (Rafatalia)<br/>
"What are you talking about, Rafatalia!?" (Naofumi)<br/>
Rafatalia seems to be caught up in the chaos as well.<br/>
"No!" (Firo)<br/>
"Firo-tan Firo-tan…" (Motoyasu)<br/>
Motoyasu begins nestling his face in Firo’s plumage.<br/>
Firo tries to use her superhuman strength to lift him off, but Motoyasu grips her with his entire body, and he isn’t moving.<br/>
When she tries to get him off, her feathers come with him. The pain prevents her from going all out.<br/>
Firo is one who hates pain.<br/>
"Save me!" (Firo)<br/>
Firo is pleading at me for help with teary eyes. What should I do.<br/>
"Fine… Motoyasu." (Naofumi)<br/>
This is no good. He can’t hear me. He can’t even hear Firo.<br/>
Motoyasu has finally broken.<br/>
Or perhaps… he has awakened to a new fetish.<br/>
He’s even accepting Monster-form Firo. Has he become a Masochist?<br/>
"Master!" (Firo)<br/>
I’m supposed to take Motoyasu to the castle, but will it be possible like this?<br/>
"If you don’t like it, just tell him and dump him." (Naofumi)<br/>
"Got it!" (Firo)<br/>
Firo walks out of the bar with Motoyasu still clinging to her.<br/>
"Eh…" (Rafatalia)<br/>
Rafatalia lets out a confused voice.<br/>
"Anyways… We’ll have to have to put turning Motoyasu in on hold. If he doesn’t suffer some more, I won’t be satisfied." (Naofumi)<br/>
"I think he has transcended the state of suffering and reached some form of enlightenment…" (Rafatalia)<br/>
"If we get Firo to act like an evil woman, he’ll probably snap out of it. Get her to tell him that she only approached him for food." (Naofumi)<br/>
"I see…" (Rafatalia)<br/>
"It’ll probably work… Probably." (Naofumi)<br/>
I have a bad premonition about this. But if I don’t do this, we’ll never get rid of him.<br/>
It’s fine. It’s Motoyasu. He should be back to skirt-chasing in no time.<br/>
And so we spent a peaceful night, and morning came.<br/>
By the way, it seems Firo finally managed to dump Motoyasu. Down a cliff.<br/>
The amount of feathers on her body has decreased.<br/>
"Now then, since we’re putting turning Motoyasu in on hold, should we wait for Shadow to return, then head back to the village?" (Naofumi)<br/>
I planned to stay away until the egg hatched, but it should hatch any minute now.<br/>
It moves occasionally. It should hatch soon.<br/>
"We should do that." (Rafatalia)<br/>
"Master, Firo want’s to leave soon…" (Firo)<br/>
Firo looks at me with fearful eyes.<br/>
She has developed yet another trauma. She hated the man from the beginning anyways.<br/>
Why did she approach him even though she hated him?<br/>
"Why did you try to cheer him on?" (Naofumi)<br/>
"Because he didn’t have any energy. He seemed like the village children when we first met them." (Firo)<br/>
But the medicine was too potent for Motoyasu.<br/>
He’s going to become annoying.<br/>
"Next time you see him, tell him the lines I taught you in advance." (Naofumi)<br/>
"Yes\~" (Firo)<br/>
"Well then, let’s get breakfast and prepare to depart." (Naofumi)<br/>
I open the door to the room.<br/>
"Good Morning, dear father-in-law." (Motoyasu)<br/>
I slam the door… Was that Motoyasu?<br/>
I must be going crazy. Let me recollect myself.<br/>
"What was that…" (Naofumi)<br/>
"Did something happen?" (Rafatalia)<br/>
"Well…" (Naofumi)<br/>
What was Father-in-Law supposed to mean? Why was Motoyasu on standby in front of the door?<br/>
I just got up, my mind isn’t working properly yet.<br/>
Explaining is a pain. I step aside and offer the door handle to Rafatalia.<br/>
Rafatalia tilts her head to the side and opens it.<br/>
"Why is the Tanuki-pig in Firo-tan’s room!?" (Motoyasu)<br/>
…<br/>
"Fuge!?" (Motoyasu)<br/>
A vein pops up on Rafatalia’s forehead. While smiling, she whacks his head and slams the door.<br/>
Tanuki-pig… I’m hearing some amazing things so early in the morning.<br/>
What is he doing?<br/>
"Well…" (Rafatalia)<br/>
Rafatalia looks just as confused as me.<br/>
"I understand the situation. What should we do…?" (Rafatalia)<br/>
"And from when was he standing in front of the door?" (Naofumi)<br/>
"I heard a banging sound quite a while ago, but he couldn’t have been there for that long…" (Rafatalia)<br/>
"I heard it too. I thought it was an adventurer wandering around, but was that Motoyasu?" (Naofumi)<br/>
He seems too energetic for having been pushed off a cliff.<br/>
"Firo." (Naofumi)<br/>
"No!" (Firo)<br/>
"If you don’t clearly tell him, he’ll never leave you alone, that man." (Naofumi)<br/>
"Uu….." (Firo)<br/>
Firo opens the door while frowning.<br/>
"Oh, Firo-tan!" (Motoyasu)<br/>
Motoyasu jumps at Firo, but Rafatalia halts him with an iron claw to the face.<br/>
"Unhand me, Tanuki-pig! I must embrace my beloved Firo-tan!" (Motoyasu)<br/>
"…" (Rafatalia)<br/>
She’s smiling, but she’s letting out a dark aura.<br/>
What is Motoyasu doing?<br/>
"Um, I only approached you for food. Don’t misunderstand my intentions." (Firo)<br/>
"Love is something that stems from misunderstandings, dear Firo-tan. It’s fine, I’ll accept your selfishness as well." (Motoyasu)<br/>
"No!" (Firo)<br/>
She’s shivering. This is no good.<br/>
I try to comprehend the current situation, and Motoyasu turns to me with serious eyes.<br/>
"Dear Father-In-Law. Please leave your daughter to me." (Motoyasu)<br/>
"Who are you calling Father-in-Law!?" (Naofumi)<br/>
I don’t remember becoming the father of this gluttonous devil-bird.<br/>
I may have raised her, but I don’t remember making her my daughter.<br/>
"Father-in-Law. I was saved by your daughter, and have realized my true feelings for her. I’ll definitely make her happy. Please leave your daughter to me!" (Motoyasu)<br/>
"And I’m saying I’m not this girl’s father!" (Naofumi)<br/>
"You can’t say that! A father shouldn’t think that way about his daughter, Father-in-Law!" (Motoyasu)<br/>
"Are you even listening to me? She isn’t my daughter!" (Naofumi)<br/>
"That sort or relationship between father and daughter is immoral, Father-in-Law!" (Motoyasu)<br/>
"Just be quiet already!" (Naofumi)<br/>
Rafatalia drives Motoyasu out and slams the door again.<br/>
This is exponentially more serious than I had previous thought.<br/>
If I deal with this poorly he might end up with irreparable mental damage.<br/>
"Step down, Tanuki-Pig! Release Firo-tan and Father-in-Law!" (Motoyasu)<br/>
Motoyasu bangs on the room’s door.<br/>
My head is hurting a lot…<br/>
I could never reason with him before, but his brain was never this messed up.<br/>
He’s become a complete stalker now.<br/>
The reason for this is… probably because Firo treated him nicely.<br/>
If you corner humans, they may develop unimaginable levels of devotion to their goals.<br/>
My and Ren’s cases prove that.<br/>
Though I don’t get what part of yesterday’s events led to… this. But it seems that Motoyasu views Firo as his savior.<br/>
Motoyasu seems to be the type that gets obsessed easily.<br/>
From Motoyasu’s reaction, is he the type of person who keeps trying until his target develops feelings for him?<br/>
… I really REALLY don’t want to involve myself in this. This is a major waste of time.<br/>
"You’re being too loud!" (Adventurer)<br/>
A female adventurer staying in the same inn begin to complain.<br/>
"You pigs are the ones who are being loud! Quit your squealing!" (Motoyasu)<br/>
"P-pigs!? What is this man saying!?" (Adventurer)<br/>
… The skirt-chasing Motoyasu is now verbally abusing women.<br/>
What sort of woman could it be? I slowly stick my head into the doorway.<br/>
The woman Motoyasu is quarrelling with is quite a beauty.<br/>
I think it’s the Onee-san that approached him earlier.<br/>
I can’t understand what drove him this far.<br/>
What the hell is going through his head…<br/>
What do Rafatalia and that Woman look like to him?<br/>
"What should we do? We won’t be able to leave like this." (Rafatalia)<br/>
"Firo, take responsibility and marr-" (Naofumi)<br/>
"No!" (Firo)<br/>
Really, what should we do? It doesn’t seem Motoyasu will leave us alone any time soon.<br/>
"Let’s leave through the window. We can explain our situation to the inn manager and run." (Rafatalia)<br/>
"U-understood." (Naofumi)<br/>
Is Motoyasu truly an idiot?<br/>
What could have led to this? I can’t even imagine it.<br/>
Why do we have to run from him?<br/>
Shouldn’t it be the reverse?<br/>
And so we left the Inn.<br/>
Afterwards, while we were travelling, Firo randomly began running off to kick things.<br/>
I can imagine what she’s kicking.<br/>
To withstand Firo’s kicks, he must have quite a bit of stamina.<br/>
Or perhaps Firo’s trauma prevents her from finding the strength to kick with all her might.<br/>
Recently I’ve been seeing Witch’s wanted poster hanging around.<br/>
She is to be captured on sight.<br/>
The problem is that she’s travelling with Ren.<br/>
And we began our escape from the clutches of the Broken Motoyasu.<br/>
