<br/>
"A Goddess…?" (Makoto)<br/>
An unbelievable beauty was standing in front of me.<br/>
Her glistening silver hair and sapphire-like eyes. Her pristine clean white skin. Her body that still has a bit of childishness remaining but is charming and bewitching. <br/>
She is so perfect like a doll, it is actually a bit scary. <br/>
"Uhm, do you have any business with me?" (Makoto)<br/>
This world is ruled by Gods. <br/>
If she really is a Goddess, then it would be better not to go against her. <br/>
Thanks to my [Clear Mind], I can stay calm even in front of a Goddess.<br/>
"I have been watching you all this time. Saving that merchant from the goblins just now regardless of the danger was a splendid act. I will welcome you as one of my own." <br/>
The Goddess smiles.<br/>
"A Goddess welcoming me…?" (Makoto)<br/>
Those words make my memories of 1 year ago resurface.<br/>
◇◇<br/>
Soon after coming to this world, there was someone who called herself the Oracle of the Water Temple. <br/>
An Oracle is a special existence even within this country’s sacred professions.<br/>
They can hear the voice of the Goddess. <br/>
The words of the Oracle are taken as the words of the Gods.<br/>
I heard that she normally acts within the church, but this time around, she came to see the otherworldlers.<br/>
Her objective was scouting.<br/>
Oracles have the ability to grant divine protection to the people that become believers of the Goddess. <br/>
The powerful Stats and rare Skills of otherworldlers must be attractive.<br/>
The one who showed up in front of us was the Water Oracle, Sofia Rozes. <br/>
She is also the princess of the Water Country, Rozes.<br/>
An important among the important. The most important person in this country.<br/>
The skills of my 1-A classmates must have been that excelling that someone like that came directly.<br/>
"You are a High Grade Mage, huh. That’s great. I will grant you the divine protection of the Water Goddess. In order to make that possible, you will have to become a believer of our Goddess, is that okay?" (Sofia)<br/>
"Ara, you have the Golden Knight skill. I will grant you the divine protection of the Water Goddess. In order to make that…" (Sofia)<br/>
And like this, she would invite more and more of my classmates.<br/>
Mostly people with rare skills.<br/>
And then, the moment she saw my Soul Book…<br/>
"You have Water Magic…Elementary Grade, huh. Do your best." (Sofia)<br/>
She smiled at me and passed by.<br/>
Eh? <br/>
"I-Is that all?" (Makoto)<br/>
"Oi, the Oracle-sama is busy." <br/>
When I tried to draw closer to her, a knight blocked my way.<br/>
Later I learned that he was the guardian knight of the Oracle.<br/>
"I will become a believer of the Water Goddess! So please can I get her divine protection?!" (Makoto)<br/>
At that time, I was desperate because I only got weak skills, so I pleaded.<br/>
When you obtain the divine protection of a Goddess, you get a variety of benefits. <br/>
I wanted the divine protection of the Water Goddess no matter what.<br/>
I was that desperate. <br/>
But the attitude of the Oracle was ice-cold.<br/>
"It seems like you need to train a bit more. Maybe next time." (Sofia)<br/>
The Water Oracle, Sofia, didn’t even look back and left.<br/>
◇◇<br/>
After that, no matter how much I trained, I didn’t get the divine protection.<br/>
Not only my classmates, but even the people of the temple were looking at me with pity, and I wet my pillow with my tears.<br/>
Since then, I began to hate the Water Oracle and the Church. I ended up hating the Goddess they worship too.<br/>
It was a bitter memory.<br/>
Remembering those times pisses me off even now. <br/>
Calm down… Don’t mind it, don’t mind it.<br/>
"That matter with the Oracle was terrible. It is okay to not believe in the Goddess that those kinds of people worship." <br/>
She spoke as if she read my mind.<br/>
Did she? <br/>
Or more like, she knows about the incident with the Water Oracle, too?<br/>
So the part about ‘I have been watching you’ was true.<br/>
"I don’t want to remember that, so let’s stop there. By the way, can you tell me your name, Goddess-sama?" (Makoto)<br/>
The Goddesses of this world have names.<br/>
The Light Hero, Sakurai, got the divine protection called [The Favor of the Sun Goddess Athena], and it is a cheat divine protection that doubles his stats related to battle. <br/>
Seriously, doesn’t he have it way too easy?<br/>
Even if I don’t get a divine protection as strong as that, if it is a famous Goddess, I can expect a divine protection, so I tried asking with that kind of ulterior motive.<br/>
"Fufu, I am a minor Goddess, so I don’t think you would know me." <br/>
"You may say that, but I would like to know the name of the Goddess I might be following." (Makoto)<br/>
"Then, I will tell you one day." <br/>
She is trying to push it off.<br/>
Why?<br/>
Can’t do anything about it, so I changed the topic.<br/>
"Will I be able to make it as an adventurer in this world?" (Makoto)<br/>
"You are worried about your low stats, right?" <br/>
"Kinda…" (Makoto)<br/>
With my magic alone, I cannot even defeat a single slime.<br/>
The power is way too low.<br/>
Also, I run out of mana in an instant.<br/>
How’s that gonna function as an adventurer?<br/>
"You have handy skills, don’t you?" <br/>
"[Clear Mind] and [RPG Player]? They are indeed handy, but it doesn’t hold a candle to the skills of mages and warriors." (Makoto)<br/>
I ended up taking a sulking tone towards a Goddess.<br/>
But these are my true feelings.<br/>
"Do you know about your classmates Suzuki-san, Yamashita-san, and Endo-san?" <br/>
She suddenly changed the topic.<br/>
The classmates I came together with.<br/>
It is not like we got along, but I do know them.<br/>
They all should have had warrior and mage skills that were above High Grade.<br/>
"Those 3 are currently missing, or dead." <br/>
"Huh?" (Makoto)<br/>
"They were overconfident about their skills. They fought monsters that were above their ability, and challenged a high difficulty dungeon, and failed." <br/>
"I see…" (Makoto)<br/>
I was cooped up in the temple for a year, so I didn’t know.<br/>
"You were in a peaceful country like Japan after all. No matter how strong of a skill you people get, your hearts won’t change. [Clear Mind] is a good skill that stops overconfidence and negligence, you know?" <br/>
"About the RPG Player skill, this is a unique skill of an otherworldler. I think this is an interesting skill, too." <br/>
"Isn’t it just a skill that changes the perspective?" (Makoto)<br/>
"By looking at yourself from the outside, you can stop surprise attacks, look 360°, and see from a far perspective. Also, it automatically does a [Mapping] of the places you have gone to. Moreover, it also has [Treasure Box Detection]. Such a handy skill like this is pretty rare, you know?"<br/>
Hmm, when you put it like that, it doesn’t sound that bad.<br/>
 I see. <br/>
Meaning that it is all about how you use it.<br/>
I feel a little bit better.<br/>
I try another question.<br/>
"You said you were watching me all the time, but why is it that you didn’t talk to me until now?" (Makoto)<br/>
"The Water Temple is under the jurisdiction of the Water Goddess. I was showing restraint." <br/>
"There were scouts of other Gods even within the Water Temple though." (Makoto)<br/>
The Light Hero Sakurai became a Light Goddess believer after all.<br/>
"Well, isn’t it fine?" <br/>
She gives a vague response.<br/>
"Makoto, will you become my believer?" <br/>
The Goddess is really pushy. <br/>
I ponder.<br/>
At first, I had my eyes stolen by her astounding beauty. <br/>
But now that I am calm, the Goddess in front of me is a bit suspicious. <br/>
Why does she want to make a person like me with weak stats and weird skills into her believer?<br/>
In the RPGs that I have played, early events like this that look good at a glance normally have something behind it when you easily choose [YES].<br/>
That’s what my gamer instinct is telling me.<br/>
Moreover, this is not like a game where I can reset.<br/>
"Let me think about it for a bit." (Makoto)<br/>
"Eh?!" <br/>
The elegant gestures of the Goddess were gone after that, and she made a panicked expression.<br/>
"W-Wait, please. You will be the follower of a Goddess, you know?! Moreover, a Goddess spoke to you personally. That’s an incredible honor, you know?!" <br/>
That’s right.<br/>
A Goddess appearing personally almost never happens.<br/>
Even the Oracle we talked about just a moment ago would only hear the Goddess’s voice at most. <br/>
It may be within a dream, but for a common person like me to see and talk with a Goddess personally…I have never heard of it before.<br/>
If she is the real deal, that is…<br/>
My [Clear Mind] is whispering to me.<br/>
"I am the real deal!" <br/>
"Eh?" (Makoto)<br/>
"Ah, shoot!" <br/>
She really is reading my mind.<br/>
"Well, if you are a Goddess, you should be able to do at least that much." (Makoto)<br/>
"Y-You are really calm…" <br/>
That’s my only redeeming feature.<br/>
I did panic a bit before though.<br/>
"H-Hey, a God coming to the human plane is difficult, you know? Can you form the contract today?" <br/>
She holds my hand as if pleading, and talks to me with an upward glance.<br/>
Kuh, her body is close.<br/>
Her beautiful face closes onto mine.<br/>
It is like how cabaret girls would deal with their customers in that TV show I saw before.<br/>
The blue eyes of the Goddess were glowing lightly. <br/>
My head is getting hazy, and it felt like it shut down for a bit there.<br/>
Is this…charm magic?<br/>
I learned about the existence of charm magic in the magic lessons of the temple.<br/>
It is a Skill that’s apparently often used by women working in brothels. <br/>
There’s a variety of charm spells in this world, but the basics are: ‘Look at the target’s eyes’, ‘and while speaking to the target in a soft voice’, ‘touch their body’.<br/>
Beginner adventurers who get caught in this charm magic, would pour all their money into the industry, and end up in debt.<br/>
It is apparently something that happens often.<br/>
Isn’t this exactly what’s being done to me right now?<br/>
But because of the third person perspective of [RPG Player] always being on, I am looking at my own state, as well as the state of the person I am speaking to, from several meters apart.<br/>
Because of that, in principle, I don’t end up in situations where I am meeting eye to eye with the other party. Also, because of the skill, it is hard to feel like the body contact is with me.<br/>
On top of that, the [Clear Mind] skill.<br/>
My mind is calm.<br/>
‘I think it would be really hard for you to get caught in charm magic, Makoto-kun’, is what the teacher at the temple told me.<br/>
"Goddess-sama, for now, please get away from me. You are close." (Makoto)<br/>
The result is that I didn’t really get distracted and I took a step back.<br/>
"E-Eh? Why isn’t it working?!" <br/>
Isn’t that a slip of the tongue, Goddess-sama?<br/>
Using charm magic to get a believer?<br/>
It feels like a recruitment for a suspicious cult.<br/>
"It isn’t suspicious!" <br/>
"Right, you can read minds." (Makoto)<br/>
Muttering things in my mind is pointless.<br/>
"In that case, you understand why I am doubting you this much, right? It would be great if you were to give up for today." (Makoto)<br/>
"No!! This is the chance I finally got after 1,000 years to obtain a believer, so I will definitely have you become my believer!!" <br/>
She finally fell on her back and began to flail her arms and legs.<br/>
Her majesty from the beginning is completely gone. <br/>
Her one piece is short, it feels as if I would be able to see it…and yet I can’t.<br/>
Is this the absolute territory of the Goddess?<br/>
While I was thinking something stupid, the Goddess asks.<br/>
"If I show you the inside of my skirt, will you become my believer?" <br/>
"What are you even proposing?" (Makoto)<br/>
The Goddess was still on her back as she looked at me with tears in her eyes.<br/>
Cute. Cute, but…<br/>
Becoming a believer is another story.<br/>
"Please please please! Become my believer. Please!" <br/>
She grabbed my shoulders and was shaking me.<br/>
As I said, you are too close.<br/>
What to do…<br/>
Honestly, I don’t know her intentions.<br/>
But I can feel how serious she is.<br/>
Anyways, I wasn’t planning on becoming a believer of any of the 6 major Goddesses. <br/>
Mostly because of the bad impression the Water Oracle gave me though.<br/>
She is going so far here.<br/>
Let’s believe that she won’t be treating me badly.<br/>
The RPG Player skill brings out the decision window.<br/>
Become a believer ←<br/>
Don’t become a believer<br/>
"Got it. I will become your believer." (Makoto)<br/>
"Eh, really? Y-Yay!" <br/>
The Goddess cheers and hops.<br/>
"Then, can you lend me your Soul Book?" <br/>
Do I have it even within my dreams?<br/>
When I looked for it, it was in the inside pocket of my clothes. <br/>
"Here you go." (Makoto)<br/>
"Yes, let’s see." <br/>
The Goddess traces her finger on my Soul Book. <br/>
I felt like the paper shone for a moment. <br/>
When I look at the contract area, it was written [First Believer of the Goddess].<br/>
"You have no one aside from me?" (Makoto)<br/>
"That’s right! You are the first! Consider it an honor!!" <br/>
My uneasiness increases. <br/>
That’s way too minor.<br/>
Just how unpopular of a Goddess are you.<br/>
It really does worry me. <br/>
If I had to point out another thing that bothers me, it would be…<br/>
"Will I get some sort of divine protection from you, Goddess-sama?" (Makoto)<br/>
This may be impudent right after becoming a believer, but it is an important point.<br/>
However, the Goddess makes a troubled expression.<br/>
"Actually, I am a young and minor God, so I can’t grant divine protection to my believers immediately. If you pray to me everyday, you might one day get one." <br/>
Eh, no way.<br/>
"Don’t worry! In exchange, I will give you this! This is the divine treasure that will be proof of our contract. It is incredible, I will have you know!" <br/>
She gave me a dagger.<br/>
"A weapon?" (Makoto)<br/>
"You can also use it as a weapon! It is a weapon forged by a Goddess, so it won’t break by normal means! When you are praying to me, pray while holding this, okay?" <br/>
Is it something like a cross?<br/>
"Then, it is about time I go. If you are troubled with anything, rely on me!" <br/>
"Ah, wait, don’t you have an instruction or something?" (Makoto)<br/>
I hurriedly checked, and the Goddess had a surprised expression.<br/>
"You don’t want me to tell you what to do, right? You like free scenarios, right?" <br/>
"Well, yeah…" (Makoto)<br/>
She really does know everything.<br/>
"In these kinds of situations, the Goddess normally gives out a mission of sorts." (Makoto)<br/>
"To think you would personally ask for it, you are a considerate believer. Hmm, then, one thing only. Get strong!!" <br/>
"Is that an order?" (Makoto)<br/>
"It isn’t an order. This is just a request of mine. You are my only believer, so I won’t forgive you if you just go and die, okay?! I have high expectations of you." <br/>
She winks at me and gives me a thumbs up, telling me: "Good luck", as she disappears.<br/>
 ◇◇<br/>
When I woke up, it was already morning, and there was an unsheathed dagger near my pillow. <br/>
T-That’s dangerous.<br/>
"Hm? Isn’t this the dagger I stole from the goblin yesterday?" (Makoto)<br/>
The rusted and tattered dagger had been reborn into something beautiful.<br/>
I hesitantly hold it in my hand.<br/>
Not too light, not too heavy; just the right weight.<br/>
My hand got used to it as if it were being sucked into it, and I felt like mana was seeping into my body. <br/>
A magic weapon?<br/>
The blade is slightly bluish, and it is releasing a mysterious light.<br/>
"Goddess-sama, thank you very much." (Makoto)<br/>
I placed both of my hands together and prayed, and at that moment, I noticed there was a dim crest at my right hand.<br/>
The crest of a dog-like animal holding a dagger in its mouth. <br/>
First time I have seen a crest like this. I should research it later.<br/>
The Soul Book says I am a believer of the Goddess.<br/>
It wasn’t a dream.<br/>
"Hm? Takatsuki-san, you had a dagger?" <br/>
Oops, that’s dangerous.<br/>
I didn’t notice that the merchant was up.<br/>
"Yeah, I was praying to the Goddess for a bit." (Makoto)<br/>
"I will pray, too. Goddess of Luck, I thank you for my meeting with Takatsuki-san." <br/>
Haha… <br/>
"Now, let’s depart. I think we will arrive in the city at around noon." <br/>
◇◇<br/>
 —Water City, Makkaren.—<br/>
It is the 20th biggest city on this continent. <br/>
The stream that flows from the Spirit Forest and the Great Forest becomes a waterway, and eventually arrives at the Shimei Lake. <br/>
At the end of the causeway of that lake there’s a beautiful city. <br/>
Inside the city there’s a lot of waterways, and people use ferries as transportation. <br/>
Wine brewing prospers here, and it is popular. The strong alcoholic drinks made in Makkaren are liked by the whole continent.<br/>
That’s what I heard from the merchant.<br/>
"We arrived safely. I truly thank you very much, Takatsuki-san." <br/>
"Same here. Thanks for teaching me a variety of things." (Makoto)<br/>
Before arriving at the city, he taught me information about the influential people of the city, the place where the adventurer guild is, the stores where I can buy cheap weapons and items, good eateries, and a decent inn. <br/>
While at it, I had him check the dagger I got from the Goddess, but he said he couldn’t check it with the [Appraisal: Elementary] of his.<br/>
We bid farewell when he arrived at his own company. <br/>
I head to the Adventurer Guild that’s downtown. <br/>
By the way, the church is apparently at the center of the city.<br/>
The power of the church in the Water Country is strong.<br/>
Because of that, a city was created with the church as the center.<br/>
However, the Water Goddess is the one that the Water Country worships, and at the center of it, there’s that Oracle.<br/>
I won’t go anywhere close to there, okay?<br/>
I fervently swore in my heart.<br/>
◇◇<br/>
 I soon found the Adventurer Guild.<br/>
It was bigger than I imagined, and it is a well-made stone structure. <br/>
When I went in, there was a wide open space where food and weapon stalls were lined up. <br/>
Is this the entrance?<br/>
"Ooi, how about a drink? We got nice cold ale!" <br/>
"We got some good weapons here that we just got from the Earth Country. If you buy them now, it will be 10% off." <br/>
It is lively.<br/>
There’s simplistic tables here and there, and there’s people who are partying as well.<br/>
When I look at the information board: there’s the resting area (you can stay the night as well, men and women separated), the training area, and there’s a storehouse for the subjugated monsters. <br/>
I thought the Adventurer Guild was simply the place where you get the adventurer license, so I thought it would be like when getting a car license, but this is more like a sports gym with entertainment facilities included. <br/>
The place to issue a license is the same place where you get quests.<br/>
Luckily, there weren’t many lined up, and I was able to get to the reception window.<br/>
"Good day, what will your business for today be?" <br/>
The receptionist lady is a beauty. <br/>
When I looked around to check the other receptionists, they were all high level as well.   <br/>
"Can I register as an adventurer?" (Makoto)<br/>
"Your first time here, I see. Then, please fill the required information in this paper here. Also, you have a Soul Book, right?" <br/>
I gave the Soul Book to the receptionist lady.<br/>
I write my name, personal history, skills, and class.<br/>
"I’m done." (Makoto)<br/>
"Thank you very much. I will confirm it then." <br/>
The receptionist lady was slightly surprised at my name and personal history saying I am an otherworldler, but she didn’t say anything.<br/>
"There’s no issues. Will you leave your class as ‘Mage Apprentice’?" <br/>
"Yes, just as it is." (Makoto)<br/>
"Please give us a bit of time to issue your license. Take this numbered paper and wait to be called." <br/>
I thought that I would get in some trouble with hoodlum adventurers since a newbie is joining the Adventurer Guild, but even when looking around, nothing like that happened.<br/>
I was able to get my adventurer license without any issues.<br/>

I got to level 2 from defeating the goblins.<br/>
About the other things, there’s the average stats that I have seen a whole lot at the temple.<br/>
I am weak.<br/>
I knew that, but it really drops my mood every time I see it.<br/>
"Oh well." (Makoto)<br/>
Thanks to [Clear Mind] I can switch gears fast.<br/>
I put away the license card, and left the Adventurer Guild.<br/>
Okay, next place.<br/>
The place I am heading to now is the Fujiwara Shop that I heard from the merchant of.<br/>
Right, my classmate Fuji-yan already has his own store.<br/>
