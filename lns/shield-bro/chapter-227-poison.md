CHAPTER 227: POISON<br/>
The rope that had connected the caterpillar and the carriage had broken, and the carriage was gone.<br/>
Kiel and the others were nowhere to be seen.<br/>
"What happened!?" (Naofumi)<br/>
As soon as the Caterpillar saw me, it quickly ran towards me.<br/>
It mumbled something while staring and clinging to me.<br/>
"I was attacked when I was peddling! The children who were riding in the carriage were kidnapped? Eh? That’s not it?" (Taniko)<br/>
Taniko tried to understand the Caterpillar, but she did not seem to understand its words well.<br/>
It was only being transmitted that something had happened.<br/>
"Where was the place!?" (Ren)<br/>
Ren asked Taniko.<br/>
"Well…" (Taniko)<br/>
"It should be in the direction where this fellow came from?" (Ren)<br/>
"Probably." (Taniko)<br/>
Ren traced back the caterpillar’s foot prints and started running.<br/>
"Oh, wait! Don’t leave me!" (Female Knight)<br/>
The female knight chased after him.<br/>
But that wouldn’t be enough.<br/>
"Filo, go with Ren." (Naofumi)<br/>
"Kue!"(Filo)<br/>
The filo which was next to me, on my instruction, started running to accompany them.<br/>
It would be best if the case was resolved with this, but….<br/>
I suppressed the uneasiness in my chest. (not sure about this)<br/>
"First, we’re treating this guy. Call Rat." (Naofumi)<br/>
While chanting recovery magic, I told Taniko to call Rat.<br/>
Recovery magic was not very effective on monsters. In this case, natural recovery or recovery by medicine would work better.<br/>
Taniko ran to Rat’s laboratory.<br/>
Suddenly, a problem started.<br/>
The caterpillar started to behave violently and tried to return the way he came until Rat arrived.<br/>
It was hard to say, but he had a powerful desire to become strong. He grieved over his cowardliness for not going after Ren. (cannot make a better translation than this)<br/>
"Okay? What happened?" (Rat)<br/>
"Apparently, thieves attacked the carriage and kidnapped the slaves." (Naofumi)<br/>
After hearing the commotion, Gaelion came flying.<br/>
The caterpillar began to tell something to Gaelion.<br/>
"Hmm… Hmm… What?" (Gaelion)<br/>
"Did you understand something? " (Naofumi)<br/>
"The fact is that there was a surprise attack that came from both the front and back" (Gaelion)   (this took the longest to translate and i think its still not good.someone can check this for me)<br/>
"What do you mean?" (Naofumi)<br/>
For a moment, I thought that the protection shields that the slaves received were rotten.<br/>
To be frank, they are much stronger than any ordinary adventurers.<br/>
I thought that the uncle of Imia class up was done and that they were defeated by smaller force, although it seems to have been different. (this may be wrong)<br/>
Still, I would like to investigate thoroughly.<br/>
Motoyasu, who was not here, came to my mind first, but I think it’s different.<br/>
Reasonably, this was Itsuki’s way of doing things.<br/>
However, a question still remained.<br/>
Itsuki, despite his selfishness, is all about his sense of justice.<br/>
This was my evaluation as a guy who investigates thoroughly.<br/>
However, even the possibility that Itsuki is moving with the mystery theory like Ren and Motoyasu is conceivably sufficient, because the Itsuki that I saw in Zeltbur got broken in various ways.<br/>
Even though it remained the same and didn’t appear, I think it’s really insidious.<br/>
These events were extremely annoying.<br/>
This bad feeling was doubled because the former Motoyasu did not hide anything that did not seem pretty.<br/>
Well, I think isn’t it Perfect-Hidden-Justice.<br/>
Huh… Anyway, it was unfortunate that Itsuki did not get captured.<br/>
Through my work, the former Ren and Motoyasu have become better already.<br/>
They changed drastically, but the way they are now is much better.<br/>
"Caterpillar also says he was attacked and fled for his life." (Gaelion)<br/>
After conveying his message properly, caterpillar felt relieved and lost all his strength. (this is the best meaning i can make)<br/>
Dead! I thought and checked his pulse.<br/>
He was breathing and not dead. He probably pushed himself in the emergency.<br/>
Well, he reached me properly and lost consciousness in a reassuring place.<br/>
But… why did Ren go to such a dangerous place?<br/>
Is it dangerous?<br/>
I need to rush after them.<br/>
It can’t be helped. I confirmed that Rat is coming, and I get ready to go out.<br/>
"Filorials." (Naofumi)<br/>
" " "KUE!""" (Filorials)<br/>
"Also, Gaelion, Rishia, and Alta will go with me!" (Naofumi)<br/>
"Yes." (Gaelion)<br/>
"Okay!"(Rishia)<br/>
" " "KUE!?""" (Filorials)<br/>
"What is it? Are you dissatisfied? The remaining members are to guard the village! Maintain the caution until I return!" (Naofumi)<br/>
I led the group while I rode on the back of Gaelion.<br/>
The Filorials and the others ran and followed me from the ground.<br/>
Though I caught up with Ren and the others before long from the sky, as expected, there was nothing in the spot where Kiel and the others were attacked.<br/>
I let Gaelion track them by smell, but he was not able to track them even halfway.<br/>
The sun had set, and I was forced to abandon the search.<br/>
Ren was not done yet, but he finally resigned after I warned him to not let a second accident occur.<br/>
I returned to the village, counted both the number of monsters and slaves, and began to prepare for dinner.<br/>
Certainly, the numbers have been reduced little by little recently.<br/>
It’s not that I didn’t notice, but I thought that peddling took time.<br/>
Now’s not the time to look away.<br/>
The Slave Crests were still functioning and have not been removed.<br/>
The numbers have not decreased, and they should be in range according to what I remember.<br/>
Yet, I do not know their whereabouts.<br/>
Because no conclusive evidence had been found today, I felt that the air in the village was heavier.<br/>
Will Raphtalia be okay? Is she training well? I pray that nothing has happened.<br/>
But, I still need to issue her instructions to come back since a problem has occurred.<br/>
The problem is… whether the instructions will arrive.<br/>
I cut today’s material with a kitchen knife and threw it into the pan.<br/>
Though I stewed it, it’s being boiled. It doesn’t stick to the hand so much.<br/>
Ren also seemed restless.<br/>
But the situation would not improve for the better even if we searched at night.<br/>
Because I could not calm down, I cooked.<br/>
Heroes are powerless at this time, and there’s no chance for me to do anything.<br/>
For now, we can only wait for something to happen. (cannot make a better translation)<br/>
"Oh! What’s with this?" I said while trying the soup that I cooked today. (Naofumi)<br/>
It’s dangerous!<br/>
Alerts sound in my head.<br/>
"Huh…" (Naofumi)<br/>
What is it? Did I add something dangerous to the dish to make it a failure?<br/>
There were no such things so far, and the soup connoisseur worked in my sight.<br/>
Toxic substance. Toxicity… middle degree. Breathing hindrance. Natural poison.<br/>
I used an antidote, and the detoxification magic cured me immediately.<br/>
What?<br/>
No, no one could make such a dangerous poison with the materials right here.<br/>
Did I mess up and make a dangerous thing with alchemy by mistake?<br/>
"Is it done?" The slave in charge of cooking asked while seeing the soup. (Slave)<br/>
"No, looks like I failed." (Naofumi)<br/>
"Eh? When it smells so good?" (Slave)<br/>
"Indeed." (Naofumi)<br/>
While saying so, I wash away the soup with a bottle of water.<br/>
Danger!<br/>
The same alerts from before were reflected in my field of vision.<br/>
What!?<br/>
Was it the water?<br/>
I carefully asked the connoisseur about the water.<br/>
"Hey, where was this water taken from?" (Naofumi)<br/>
"What? From the well that we always use…" (Slave)<br/>
But what do I say that it is mixing or it is poisonous?<br/>
I had an unpleasant hunch.<br/>
"It’s useless!" (Naofumi)<br/>
"I don’t get it." (Slave)<br/>
"Anyway, it’s no use and it’s painful." (Naofumi)<br/>
When I looked outside at the dining room, a Filorial picked a quarrel with a slave and prevented him from drinking the well water.<br/>
Filorials have wild intuition. He is talking, since I’m not there, and interfering.<br/>
The Filorial did well. I will prepare a reward for him later.<br/>
"All members, do not drink the water." (Naofumi)<br/>
I gave instructions in a loud voice.<br/>
"What happened?" (Slaves)<br/>
"There is a possibility that a poison was mixed into the well" (Naofumi)<br/>
"Is that true?" (Slaves)<br/>
"It is like that, and I will investigate it in a little bit." (Naofumi)<br/>
I called for Rat, who finished treatment of caterpillar, to investigate the well and the nearby river.<br/>
The result was that poison was mixed in both.<br/>
Fortunately, the bio-plant was detoxifying, and the poison won’t soak into the earth.<br/>
However, if you look closely, fish-type monsters were dead and floated in the river.<br/>
The sun had set, and in the dark, the search for the criminal who poisoned the river did not go well.<br/>
However, I found a corpse of a Demi-Human adventurer upstream.<br/>
"Is this fellow the culprit?" (Naofumi)<br/>
"I don’t know." (Rat)<br/>
Rat checked the corpse like a doctor.<br/>
Did this demi-human pour the poison into my village? Even if I’m mistaken, this person is certainly not from my village.<br/>
In the village which I command, for the time being, I seem to be their religion’s God.<br/>
Could it be the people of the Schildwelt or Schildfrieden?<br/>
I cannot pinpoint it from the corpse, which won’t speak.<br/>
"Earl, look over here." (Rat)<br/>
Rat pointed at the corpse of the demi-human.<br/>
"There’s a paper in his hand. Something is written on it." (Rat)<br/>
"Can you read it?" (Naofumi)<br/>
"It is the judgment of the person who calls himself a god. But, aren’t these letters from Melromarc’s official language?" (Rat)<br/>
"What?" (Naofumi)<br/>
Wait a minute, did the radicals of the Religion of the Shield attack me?<br/>
No, that’s doubtful. It’s Melromarc’s official language.<br/>
The official language of Schildwelt or Schildfrieden should have been used if that was the case.<br/>
"Looks like you wrote and translated it well. It’s feeling that you got used to by understanding the habit of the characters, right?" (cannot find any better translation)<br/>
"Such a thing?" (Naofumi)<br/>
"Yes, also…"(rat)<br/>
Rat picked up a medicine and dripped it onto the chest of the demi-human.<br/>
Then, on the chest of the body,… A slave crest shone faintly.<br/>
It was a slave crest that disappears upon death. They intended to cover it, but they cannot deceive us.<br/>
"It’s a slave I… Oh, it is white." (Naofumi)<br/>
"Well." (Rat)<br/>
For a demi-human Schildwelt or Schildfrieden slave to poison and then commit suicide for a religious reason… would be impossible.<br/>
I heard in that in such countries, demi-human and human slaves have the same family/tribe crest.<br/>
The possession of the paper, the mystery of the concealed slave crest, there must be a hidden, decisive reason.<br/>
Moreover, it was obvious that their wrath is aimed at me…<br/>
It seems that they want me to be suspected.<br/>
I will let you make a human slave if it is me.<br/>
What a childish trick.<br/>
The one which made the criminal demi-humans affiliates or gave a bad impression and stood up…<br/>
"Bury it carefully." (Naofumi)<br/>
"Is that okay?" (Rat)<br/>
"He was a victim. He would have gone through a lot of hardships so far. I will treat the dead politely at least." (Naofumi)<br/>
