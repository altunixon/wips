This is not from Satou's POV (Nana's POV) <br/>

<br/>
Intermission: Golden Knight and the Caged Birds<br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
The sight monitoring system has raised an emergency directive.<br/>
Adding the object before my sight with priority tag.<br/>
<br/>
There are two figures of young organisms over there.<br/>
They are imprisoned in the birdcage hanged in front of the slave trader.<br/>
<br/>
The logic circuit urges to have me rescue them.<br/>
<br/>
Executing rescue--Error.<br/>
Re-execute--Error.<br/>
<br/>
This is a grave situation.<br/>
Confirming that the reason for the error is Master's commands which have the maximum priority.<br/>
<br/>
There is an entry that prohibits me from relocating articles without being accompanied with money transfer.<br/>
It cannot be helped.<br/>
<br/>
I do not have the authority to break the prohibited matter.<br/>
I step into the firm, and proceed to secure the young organism via the regular route.<br/>
<br/>
"Proprietor, I want to release these children, so I claim."<br/>
"If it isn't explorer young lady, you have discerning eyes. These are quite a rare species even among the featherkins--"<br/>
<br/>
In summary, "Bring me 100 gold coins if you want to own the young organisms", such an unreasonable thing has been established.<br/>
<br/>
The money in hand, two gold coins.<br/>
Lacking 98 gold coins more.<br/>
<br/>
I will have Master's support.<br/>
In accordance to the answer from logic circuit, I leave the shop.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
◇<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
"No."<br/>
"Please reconsider."<br/>
"No."<br/>
<br/>
Master refuses to secure the young organisms.<br/>
I tried to entice him with puff-puff, but Lulu interfered.<br/>
<br/>
Logic circuit announces that without Master's support, helping the young organisms is hopeless.<br/>
I am troubled.<br/>
<br/>
"What's wrong? Nana-sama"<br/>
<br/>
The beastkin person who works as a teacher of the training school applies for a conversation.<br/>
<br/>
"I am currently searching the way to secure fund. If you have a good idea, please present it."<br/>
"Let's see, I think everyone from Pendragon probably can subjugate the Ruby Golem in the upper Area 33 for quick money?"<br/>
<br/>
After searching the name 'ruby', I've identified that it is a kind of gem.<br/>
The size of the ruby that composes the body of a golem should be worth at least 100 gold coins.<br/>
I tell my thank to the informant and leave right away.<br/>
<br/>
"Ah, Nana-sama. Nearby the Ruby Golem, Deadly Poison Slimes are--"<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
◇<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
I confirm the route on the explorer guild, and depart to the labyrinth.<br/>
I change my equipments with Orichalcum ones, and raise my moving pace. If I were slow, the permitted time to release them would expire.<br/>
<br/>
Following Master's example, I exterminate the small fries with Flexible Swords, and crush the strong ones by smashing them with the Orichalcum great sword.<br/>
<br/>
『What's that? A golden knight?』<br/>
『Oy oy, who the heck is that? It killed the labyrinth scorpion with a single blow.』<br/>
『Maybe it's some Red Iron bunch?』<br/>
『There's no one that showy!』<br/>
<br/>
Sometimes I pass by other explorers, but since dealing with them has low priority, I put actions like talking with them to the furthest end of the processing queue.<br/>
<br/>
Against opponents that occasionally appear and are ineffective against material sword, I promptly eliminate them with nature magic.<br/>
<br/>
『Oy, did it just use chantless magic?』<br/>
『Chantless, the hero-sama?』<br/>
『It's the golden hero-sama!』<br/>
<br/>
Some explorers that I've saved by chance apply for a conversation with me, but since my processing queue is packed, I cannot respond.<br/>
<br/>
This time, a hydra with five heads is blocking the way.<br/>
I want to promptly eliminate it, but since other explorers are fighting it, eliminating the hydra would classify as one of the prohibited matter, [Sideswipe].<br/>
<br/>
Every one of the explorers is acting inefficiently.<br/>
I searched for the way to cope with this, and got one conclusion.<br/>
<br/>
"I ask! Do you wish for relief!"<br/>
<br/>
Yes, if the other party requests relief, it won't qualify as a prohibited matter.<br/>
It's an excellent idea if I do say so myself, so I praise myself.<br/>
<br/>
"Please help us!"<br/>
"I take charge of the relief."<br/>
<br/>
Activating the function [Fortress] on the equipment that Master has given me.<br/>
Eight force shields and three magic walls block the hydra's fire and poison breath.<br/>
<br/>
I do not have overwhelming offensive power like Liza and Pochi.<br/>
However, I have the the impregnable defensive power that Master has bestowed.<br/>
<br/>
I nullify the entire attacks, and eliminate the hostile unit with plain great sword attack.<br/>
<br/>
"Ooh! The hydra's head is cut with one swing of the great sword!"<br/>
"Apart from that, why is it fine against the hydra's flame that can even melt iron!"<br/>
<br/>
I am equipped with Master's armor.<br/>
This result is natural so I analyze.<br/>
<br/>
I eliminate the hydra and hurry toward Area 33.<br/>
Noise asking about the core entered my hearing circuit from behind, but since its sequence priority was low, I canceled it.<br/>
In order to increase my moving speed, I grant myself physical reinforcement with nature magic.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
◇<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
I check that here is Area 33 from the Sign Monument.<br/>
I could have defined the Ruby Golem's location if I had Master's enemy searching function.<br/>
<br/>
Discovered a passage full of slimes ahead.<br/>
<br/>
Using Force Spear to eliminate them--failed. Confirmed it absorbs force spear.<br/>
Using Flexible Sword to eliminate them--failed. Cutting is not effective. Confirmed it absorbs the blade.<br/>
Using the great sword to eliminate them--failed. Cutting is not effective.<br/>
<br/>
Searching for effective countermeasures--not applicable.<br/>
I evade the slimes and continue searching.<br/>
<br/>
Discovered a Ruby Golem in the space ahead.<br/>
Confirmed several slimes along the way.<br/>
<br/>
Searching for effective countermeasures--not applicable.<br/>
Searching for ways to get close to Ruby Golem--not applicable.<br/>
<br/>
Searching for effective countermeasures--not applicable.<br/>

<br/>
Searching for effective countermeasures--not applicable.<br/>
Searching for ways to get close to Ruby Golem--not applicable.<br/>
<br/>
Confirmed that the logic circuit is looping.<br/>
Analyzing breakthrough measure--discovered Arisa's collection of sayings, commencing search....<br/>
<br/>
Discovered the countermeasure.<br/>
<br/>
Booting up multiple [Shelters].<br/>
Activating Orichalcum Armor's emergency vernier.<br/>
<br/>
I pass through the defending camping slimes with the sudden acceleration.<br/>
Confirming the scattered slimes behind me.<br/>
Threat level, low. I leave them alone.<br/>
<br/>
"Ruby Golem! If you think that you're great since you're a gem, that's a misunderstanding, so I refute!"<br/>
<br/>
I crushed the approaching Ruby Golem with continuous [Force Spear (Javelin)] blows.<br/>
Since the objective is rebelling, I use the great sword carefully, I'm worried with my remaining mana.<br/>
The condition that allows the use of emergency measure has been cleared--utilizing the magic recovery potion.<br/>
<br/>
All Mission Complete.<br/>
Commencing return.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
◇<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
"This is a Ruby Golem! How did you get it in complete shape!"<br/>
"Conversion."<br/>
"No, how did--"<br/>
"Conversion."<br/>
"Ah, yes. Please wait a moment."<br/>
<br/>
I've safely secured 100 gold coins.<br/>
Successfully safeguard the young organisms in the slave firm.<br/>
<br/>
Naming the white featherkin young organism [Shiro].<br/>
Naming the black featherkin young organism [Kuro]--error.<br/>
<br/>
Searching the library, re-naming it to [Crow].<br/>
<br/>
After returning home, I introduce them to Master.<br/>
<br/>
"I have secured them. They are Shiro and Crow."<br/>
"Return them."<br/>
<br/>
Master-!<br/>
Searching for countermeasures to oppose the merciless order--Requesting supports from friendly units.<br/>
<br/>
"Please reconsider."<br/>
"No."<br/>
"Isn't it fine, raised right, they can be the communication unit, or the bombardment survey unit~"<br/>
"Cute~?"<br/>
"That's right nanodesu!　Cute is justice nanodesu!"<br/>
"Nn."<br/>
"Master, I would also like to ask for it."<br/>
"I am sorry to intrude, but since Nana has bought them as slaves, how about training them as maid apprentices?"<br/>
<br/>
With the help of friendly units reinforcement, Master finally raises the white flag, and I have safely acquired the permission to let Shiro and Crow take a new post in the mansion.<br/>
With feeling full of gratitude, I was going to do puff-puff that Master liked when we were going to bed, but I received concentrated bombardment from the friendly units.<br/>
<br/>
It is absurdly baffling.<br/>
<br/>
I evaluate that expressing gratitude is something with high degree of difficulty.<br/>
While being confused with bewilderment and delight, I wrapped myself with Shiro's and Crow's wings, and fell asleep.<br/>
