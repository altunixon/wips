Original translator: 黒曜石ペガサス Original chapter<br/>
So I don’t know Yoraikun’s plans, but I feel like it would be a waste of his time to re-translate chapter 264. So, I took the liberty of editing it. I don’t know how accurate it is, and maybe Yoraikun is going to re-translate it anyway, but hopefully, I could save him some effort and go straight to chapter 265.<br/>
Edit: Good Job everyone! Thanks for all pitching in! Special thanks to rafutalio for a great TLC.<br/>
<br/>
Chapter 264 (Edited)<br/>
"Where to next?" (Raphtalia)<br/>
"Let’s see… let’s go to to Firo’s room." (Naofumi)<br/>
I gave Firo a room once. Specifically, a room in my house.<br/>
I thought the Filo Rial barn would be fine, but since Firo wanted it, it couldn’t be helped.<br/>
Children want their own rooms, don’t they? It’s the same as that.<br/>
She herself hasn’t really used it though.<br/>
I put a lock in place just in case, but I guess it’s a good time to see what she’s been up to.<br/>
We go into my house, and I open the door to Firo’s room.<br/>
"This is…." (Naofumi)<br/>
Children’s toys and shiny things are scattered all over the place. It looks just like a little kid’s room.<br/>
Except, there’s a bird nest made of straw.<br/>
Has she used it? There aren’t many traces of it.<br/>
"There may be eggs around." (Naofumi)<br/>
"Can Firo even lay eggs?" (Raphtalia)<br/>
"Well, maybe she made some with Motoyasu… no, Melty." (Naofumi)<br/>
"Melty’s a human girl!" (Raphtalia)<br/>
Raphtalia’s retort is sharp huh.<br/>
But, while Rafutalia may not know, Firo and Melty have that kind of relationship.<br/>
The main cause for that was me though.<br/>
That whole affair is way over my head.<br/>
She herself claims it isn’t like that however.<br/>
"I don’t know, some might even be Naofumi-sama’s." (Raphtalia)<br/>
"As if that’s possible!" (Naofumi)<br/>
God, Raphtalia, who would think that?<br/>
Don’t talk nonsense like making Firo my partner. (ED: In a sexual way)<br/>
…Just a little while ago she attacked me, however. [ED: also translatable as raped lol]<br/>
In any case, is such a messy room even worth investigating? But…<br/>
So, while thinking ‘is there even anything in such a disordered room,’ I investigate, however……<br/>
Some quite expensive-looking minerals and ornaments were carelessly placed around.<br/>
Just where did this come from?<br/>
Then, these bones inside the nest, the hell are they? Leftovers?<br/>
Firo that girl, if I think about it she does have two sides to her.<br/>
The airheaded, pure side and the wild animal, proper, side. Perhaps, the wild animal one is her true nature.<br/>
Well I’ve been careful before, there aren’t pellets so it’s fine but……<br/>
This bone…is dragon-ish.<br/>
Are these the spoils of war from when I let Firo go wild and had her raise her Lv?<br/>
"She’d probably get mad if we take them away, huh?" (Naofumi)<br/>
"I think she’d be angry from you looking around at your own accord." (Raphtalia)<br/>
"Yeah…" (Naofumi)<br/>
…huh?<br/>
""Pii!""<br/>
Filo Rial chicks come out from the insides of my armor and start examining the room.<br/>
"What is this?!" (Raphtalia)<br/>
"Well, some chicks I received from Firo, but just from where did they come from?" (Naofumi)<br/>
When I take my armor they’re not there, even when I take off my clothes they don’t come out.<br/>
At times, they come out from the gaps in my armor.<br/>
What are these Filo Rial chicks?<br/>
"Naofumi-sama, could they be… parasitic?" (Raphtalia)<br/>
"What did you say?" (Naofumi)<br/>
These two chicks, it can’t be, they are parasitizing me?<br/>
Don’t joke around!<br/>
""Pii!""<br/>
The two baby chicks go and take something from the nest.<br/>
What is that?<br/>
They come back with a gem a little bigger than my fist.<br/>
"What a pretty gem. It’s light-pink colored." (Raphtalia)<br/>
"Yeah… What is it?" (Naofumi)<br/>
"Who knows." (Raphtalia)<br/>
With my [Judgment], I try to identify it. [ED: Judgement here is used as a name of an ability. Exactly when Naofumi got it is unknown to me.]<br/>
Firo’s …Magic Stone?<br/>
""Pii!""<br/>
With the magic stone, the two monster chicks jump into my hand .<br/>
"I hold it and then?" (Naofumi)<br/>
""Pii!""<br/>
"If Firo finds out about this, won’t it be dangerous?" (Naofumi)<br/>
""Pii!""<br/>
The two monster chicks buzz and shake their necks.<br/>
What are you two doing!?<br/>
While I was wondering about this, the magic stone in my hand melts and then evaporates.<br/>
"UWAAAA" (Naofumi)<br/>
A cloud of smoke billows up, and some kind of vapor flies towards me.<br/>
Ah Crap! Watch out!<br/>
Immediately after I thought that, the smoke wraps around me….and clears up.<br/>
"Wha, what was that?" (Naofumi)<br/>
"Naofumi-sama, are you all right?" (Raphtalia)<br/>
"I don’t feel particularly weird…." (Naofumi)<br/>
Just in case, I confirm my Status.<br/>
I would be troubled if I got some Status Abnormality while I didn’t notice.<br/>
It may be bad judgement from me, but I feel as though my magic power has increased. Actually…What’s going on?<br/>
Something like Gaelion’s divine protection seems to have been applied.<br/>
Also, I feel like I can tell where Firo is.<br/>
Presumably, she’s heading my direction.<br/>
Seriously, what’s going on here?<br/>
"Pii!"<br/>
"Seriously you-!" (Naofumi)<br/>
As I think that, the two chick’s monster crest begin to change.<br/>
The shield is shining.<br/>
Skill < Filo-Rial: Familiar> Mastered.<br/>
Skill <Filo-Rial: Mode-Change><br/>
Familiar?<br/>
It’s like those familiars from games right…?<br/>
What exactly is it?<br/>
But, if I mind it too much it’ll be dangerous.<br/>
Firo is very soon coming back home!<br/>
"Raphtalia. Hurry and get out. Firo is coming back!" (Naofumi)<br/>
"Eh? Um, yeah!" (Raphtalia)<br/>
We leave from the room in a hurry.<br/>
Immediately after that.<br/>
"I’m back!ー" (Firo)<br/>
Firo comes happily through the front door.<br/>
"Welcome back." (Raphtalia)<br/>
"Y, you seem to have known I was coming back huh." (Firo)<br/>
"Well, somehow." (Naofumi)<br/>
I wonder what’s that?<br/>
I can feel where Firo is without checking for things like Ki.<br/>
Speaking of which, Familiar ・ Firo Rial and Monster Change ・ Filo Rial are what exactly?<br/>
"Ah, Masterー. You seeー, Fitoria’s learned Skill, the thanks for the other timeー" (Firo)<br/>
She saw through me!?<br/>
In that case, there’s no need to hide, huh?<br/>
"Well, you seeー, those children were entrusted by Fitoria and sent to Master, butー…They’re monsters created to be able to protect Master any timeー" (Firo)<br/>
"I see, so is that why they appear all of a sudden?" (Naofumi)<br/>
"Un. She said they stayed quiet until they adapted to Masters magicー" (Firo)<br/>
"They’re not parasites inside me?" (Naofumi)<br/>
"Yeah, um ….huh? I can’t hear her voice anymore!?" (Firo) (TL: Fitoria’s voice)<br/>
Firo touches her ahoge and answers.<br/>
I knew it.<br/>
These Filo Rial chicks ARE parasites inside of me!<br/>
"If you dislike it, we can attach it to Firo though." (Firo)<br/>
"Heh-" (Naofumi)<br/>
"It’s become possible for Master’s magic power to be granted to Firo, so Firo knows where Master is." (Firo)<br/>
"Ah, that’s right" (Naofumi)<br/>
"…A while ago, weren’t you in Firo’s room?" (Firo)<br/>
Gulp…<br/>
Well, even if it’s exposed to Firo, there’s no particular problem.<br/>
"Well, we went to go see your room. Be a little more organized." (Naofumi)<br/>
"Boo-" (Firo)<br/>
"In your nest, we found a cherry pink stone." (Naofumi)<br/>
"There was such a thingー? Firo didn’t know at allー" (Firo)<br/>
"Didn’t know huh?" (Naofumi)<br/>
"Now that you mention it… Melty-chan said she saw it too, the next morning from when we slept together."(Firo)<br/>
"Wow-" (Naofumi)<br/>
"Recently, the Melty had the same kids as Master. Did she get it the same way?" (Firo)<br/>
Melty was parasited too?<br/>
She simply has a worrisome nature too.<br/>
Is it wrong to say that I’m the cause?<br/>
"Pii"<br/>
At any rate, it bothers me so let’s stick them to Firo.<br/>
I grab the two and press them against Firo. They become soft and go into her.<br/>
"Eh?"<br/>
Raphtalia is wide eyed.<br/>
The human form Firo’s wings shine.<br/>
An icon for FiloRial: Mode Change pops up into my view.<br/>
….It seems to have some sort of numerical pattern.<br/>
Default settings such as power, speed, and magic, as well as various other things, pop up.<br/>
For the time being, let’s try power.<br/>
"Ah, I feel like some kind of power is surging out of me" (Firo)<br/>
"Fumu." (Naofumi)<br/>
Ah, so I can tamper with Firo’s settings with this?<br/>
Let’s change it back to default. If she ends up going out of control, it’ll be troublesome.<br/>
"Pii"<br/>
The two chicks slip into my armor.<br/>
Damn! GET OUT!<br/>
Thus, I took off my armor, but they didn’t come out! They’re not underneath my clothes either.<br/>
Jeez, Filo Rials are unnecessary things to install on me.<br/>
Or maybe I should say, Firo strangely got a power up possibility, that kind of thing? Don’t screw with me.<br/>
It would’ve been better if I never examined Firo’s room.<br/>
I think I’ll give her multiple, unreasonable instructions in spite!<br/>
"Firo, your room is surprisingly dirty. I want it cleaned regularly!" (Naofumi)<br/>
"YEAH!" (Firo)<br/>
Somehow happy, Firo starts cleaning her room as per my instructions.<br/>
The expensive-looking minerals etc. aren’t needed, so she took them to the storehouse. At least a little bit of her judgement seems to have improved.<br/>
"Somehow, you seeーI feel like now I can understand Master betterー" (Firo)<br/>
"Is that so" (Naofumi)<br/>
"I won’t lose to Onee-chan." (Firo)<br/>
"What are you talking about?" (Naofumi) (TL: Sorry Raphtalia, dense mofo)<br/>
"Master, after this are you going to look around the rooms of the other children in the village?" (Firo)<br/>
"Ah." (Naofumi)<br/>
I had thought about looking through the village once.<br/>
As long as it’s not my stuff we’re all going to see, it’s all right.<br/>
So after that, we take Firo around the village to inspect things in everyone else’s rooms.<br/>
Next, we go to the Loincloth dog… I mean, Kiel’s room, and find her diary.<br/>
Of course we read it and, the contents were things like what delicious food she ate that day, how to wear the loincloth, ‘in order to become a honorable man,’ etc.<br/>
……Inside the room there is a dog house, what does that mean!? That Loincloth dog…<br/>
Next is valley girl. (TL: Taniko)<br/>
She seems to be researching monster ecology, but it’s an orderly room.<br/>
All of my monsters are cataloged and organized in books by size, shape, and personality, with details written very meticulously on each page.<br/>
She loves her monsters the same as ever I guess.<br/>
"Somehow, all this seems like a bad thing… I guess everyone’s got a unique personality right?" (Raphtalia)<br/>
"Yeah!" (Firo)<br/>
"I guess so…" (Naofumi)<br/>
Next up is Atlas and Fohl’s house.<br/>
In fact, until recently, Atlas is the one who used it.<br/>
……I check inside and the cleaning seems to be thorough.<br/>
Well, Atla always hangs by my place, so if Fohl isn’t around, it mostly goes unused?<br/>
First is Fohl’s room.<br/>
There’s only a table and a well-made bed haphazardly shoved in the room.<br/>
Well, he came back today so there’s no reason for there to be any changes.<br/>
Inside Atlas’s room, it somehow explosively became full of stuffed animals.<br/>
Atlas never gave indication she was into that, did she?<br/>
Wait a sec, these couldn’t be Fohl’s belongings, could they?<br/>
Really?<br/>
Rather than Atlas’s room…this is Fohl’s room!?<br/>
I feel like it’s become more fancy than when I saw it before.<br/>
Pink wallpaper hung on the walls. There’s not much evidence that the bed was used.<br/>
Somehow…… it feels disconnected from all the rooms I’ve seen up until now, this room.<br/>
Like a girl vibe for instance…<br/>
"It’s such a lovely room. Is this the room Atla-chan sleeps in?" (Raphtalia)<br/>
"No. It’s probably more likely that the room won’t be used until Fohl gets back." (Naofumi) (TL: poor Fohl)<br/>
"True, Atlas is usually always sleeping in the bed next to Master." (Firo)<br/>
"……That’s my bed!?" (Raphtalia)<br/>
"Now that you mention it, that’s true. She and Sadina sleep together." (Naofumi)<br/>
"I’m stuck with sleeping on the bed with Atla-chan and Sadina-neesan’s smell, is it……?" (Raphtalia)<br/>
Raphtalia’s eyebrows rise a little frustratedly.<br/>
Come on now, don’t be like that.<br/>
What Atlas actually wants is to sleep in my bed, but pointing that out doesn’t seem necessary.<br/>
Let’s leave it as Fohl’s dream room.<br/>
So…… about Sadina’s room, it’s not in this village.<br/>
Her house is in that secret base.<br/>
After that is Imia’s room.<br/>
The Lumos prepared their residence under the village.<br/>
I hear it’s been built such that a cave-in doesn’t happen.<br/>
Because it’s not made from Camping Plant, I can’t force my way in, but there was no lock.<br/>
The inside of Imya’s room is full of drawings of clothes. What appear to be molding models, etc, were put around, so I can see she was tackling dressmaking seriously.<br/>
Oh? The sunglasses I made are decorating the room it seems.<br/>
The one she’s using now is one I later asked another of the Lumo race to make.<br/>
‘It’s better than the one I made off the cuff, right?’ as such I recommended it.<br/>
To greatly value her things, what a good girl.<br/>
The main stuff is here, huh?<br/>
The remaining slaves’ stuff are pretty similar.<br/>
Except, just like Firo’s, many of them are pretty dirty.<br/>
At dinner, I inform them that I did the surprise inspection and caution them.<br/>
