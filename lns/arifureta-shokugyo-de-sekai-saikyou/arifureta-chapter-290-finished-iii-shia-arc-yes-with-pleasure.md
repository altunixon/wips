Arifureta After III   Shia Arc   Yes, With Pleasure!!<br/>
<br/>
The scene of death that Shia’s characteristic magic, "Future Sight" showed wasn’t simple.<br/>
In the end, it was something that could possibly kill both the demon king and the bug bunny.<br/>
Shia was glaring at the black metal box she sent flying from Hajime’s hand while her rabbit ears stood on end.<br/>
Hajime also fully put up his guard seeing Shia acting like that.<br/>
But, after contemplating for a while, he approached the metal box with brisk steps. And then, he casually picked it up.<br/>
「Yosh, let’s open it.」<br/>
「WHYYY!?」<br/>
Shia retortedtsukkomi while slapping Hajime’s hand. Hajime lightly dodged it.<br/>
「Hajime-san, are you listening? That is bad news, you know? Something that can kill even us is inside it, you know? And yet why are you going to open it so calmly like that! Hah, don’t tell me, do you have some kind of worry that you cannot say to us!? Please don’t be rash! Suicide is no good, absolutely――」<br/>
「Calm down.」<br/>
A sure kill artificial arm finger flick burst on Shia’s forehead. Shia bent backward as though she was just sniped on her forehead. She was holding her head saying 「NUOOOOOH; my brain is shakiiing!?」 while arching like a bridge.<br/>
「Uu, why is it that I’m unable to defend against Hajime-san’s tsukkomi? The current me is alert, and my physical abilities are also increased, so just a finger flick shouldn’t be this painful……」<br/>
「That’s because it’s "Super Penetrating Finger Flick" after all. I have a lot of penetrating type skills to transmit impact to the inside that I mastered for your sake.」<br/>
「……Why is that, for my sake?」<br/>
Shia’s posture was flexibly returning from the bridge shape to normal while she asked with a fixed stare.<br/>
Hajime returned a complicated expression in response.<br/>
「Because you, ain’t you a Termin○tor bunny who made *kan-* sound when fired upon by normal bullets and repelled it like it’s a normal thing. The railgun is too dangerous, and as expected I don’t want to try to hit you seriously. In that case, I’ll need a technique that can go through you to a certain degree even if it’s just a blow, right?」<br/>
Just as Hajime said, while Shia was using "Steel Clothes" she could use her flesh body to repel attacks if it was just on the level of a normal bullet. Although the bullet wasn’t electromagnetically accelerated, as expected even Hajime would look at Shia with a twitching expression thinking 「This girl ain’t a living thing anymore」 when a bullet made a *kan-* sound and got deflected back during training.<br/>
Although, Hajime was also a man. He didn’t want to take the option of not doing anything while his card was sealed by his lover. There, so that he could inflict a telling blow even against Shia in the state of "Or rather this rabbit, don’t mention blade, even a bullet doesn’t work anymore, seriously", he mastered a technique of the type that penetrated inside the body.<br/>
「U, unknowingly, I was strengthening Hajime-san even further.」<br/>
「Not just my artificial arm, I became able to do it even with my fleshy parts. I also developed a special stun bullet that gives pain but no damage――I named it "Gag Bullet".」<br/>
「What pointlessly high technological strength.」<br/>
‘Wait, that’s not the point!’, Shia returned the deviating talk back on track.<br/>
「If Hajime-san isn’t trying to avert your eyes from a particularly harsh reality, then why the heck are you going to leap headfirst into your own death?」<br/>
Hajime’s answer toward Shia’s question was extremely simple.<br/>
「No, I’m not gonna die.」<br/>
「Eh, no, but……」<br/>
Certainly, Shia’s Future Sight that informed her of her death had activated. Thus Shia couldn’t hide her bewilderment toward Hajime who, for some reason, was convinced that he wasn’t going to die.<br/>
Hajime spoke the truth toward such Shia with an exasperated face.<br/>
「Now see here, try recalling it carefully. That ability of yours, it’s simply showing "the possibility of death". In the end, it’s not like it’s settled that you are really going to die for sure if you are following that path.」<br/>
「Uu~n?」<br/>
「For example……try remembering when you saved Aiko at the city of Ur. At that time, you should’ve seen the image of you being pierced by the magic of a devil race together with Aiko and died.」<br/>
「That’s right. Because I was accidentally in the line of fire. But but, I was saved because I avoided that future, you know?」<br/>
「What are you saying. You wouldn’t die even if you didn’t dodge for sure. At that point in time, even if your heart was pierced, I had the god water on hand, y’know?」<br/>
「Aa……」<br/>
Shia finally guessed what Hajime was trying to say.<br/>
Yes, regarding the event that connected to Shia’s death, her "vision of death" didn’t go as far as including the "response" after that to make the judgment whether she would actually die or not. In the end, it was only showing her the event that was directly connected to her death.<br/>
At that time, Shia got hit directly by the magic and got lethally wounded. Certainly, if after that "nothing was done to her", even if it was Shia, no matter how tough her body and life force were, she should die.<br/>
However, if she was made to drink the god water by Hajime, then naturally, she would be saved.<br/>
In other words, other than "evading beforehand" the event that would directly connect to her death, "the vision of death" could also be averted by "evading death by dealing with the aftermath".<br/>
「Certainly, the inside of this metal box could possibly kill us if we are planning to get killed obediently. But naturally, we are going to react, so, well, surely we aren’t going to die.」<br/>
「Uu~, I see desu. We also have healing medicine here.」<br/>
「Of course, this is "something" on the level that exposes me, who has resistance against poison, and you with your bugged physical ability to danger. It’s possible that our countermeasures might not be effective, but……」<br/>
There Hajime paused for a moment, then with a smartphone in one hand,<br/>
「Even if we die, it’s fine if we are resurrected.」<br/>
「Ah, yes. That’s right isn’t it.」<br/>
That thing that was referred to with a light tone as though saying ‘if there is no bread then~’ was――resurrection of the dead.<br/>
Actually, one of the smartphone’s functions was to monitor the vitals of the owner continuously, and in the case of the owner’s vitals entering a critical stage because of some abnormality, the smartphone would automatically open a small gate.<br/>
What would fly out from the gate, was the light of the satellite type resurrection magic radiator artifact operating outside the Earth’s atmosphere――Bel Agarta.<br/>
Today too Bel Agartalight of blessings and resurrection was shining above the head of the demon king. That’s why it’s okay even if you die, isn’t it! You will be able to come back to life, you know!<br/>
「And so, just in case, I’ll put up a barrier and try to open it quickly now.」<br/>
「U, uu~. I, guess. I understand that it’s all right, but……」<br/>
Even though she was the bug bunny who always made do somehow with her fighting spirit, right now she was really indecisive. Her rabbit ears were timidly moving limply *henyon henyon*. Her rabbit ears were saying 「But still, in the vision Hajime-san somehow looked like he was really suffering see~, it’s fine even if that box isn’t opened I think~」 more eloquently than anything.<br/>
Honestly speaking, for Hajime, even if he was told that this thing might possibly kill him, in the end, it would be no problem at all with the light of resurrection magic, so he wasn’t worried at all, and his curiosity won out.<br/>
Conversely speaking, it also meant that he was purposefully going to risk danger just because of curiosity.<br/>
(This is troubling……I didn’t intend to cause her to make that kind of face though……. Did I get too high spirited?)<br/>
Hajime wouldn’t keep insisting until it made Shia worried. Above all else, it also could be said that his sense of danger was slightly dimming just because they were on Earth. Perhaps he was unknowingly too conceited and thinking that Hajime smiled bitterly at Shia whose rabbit ears were still going *henyon henyon*.<br/>
「I get it already Shia. I won’t open it. I also don’t have the intention of ending up like Pandora.」<br/>
「Hajime-san……ehehe, that’s right. That way is better desu.」<br/>
The Shia’s expression, which sensed he was considering her feelings, burst into a wide and loose grin *nihee~*. She immediately hugged Hajime’s arm and rubbed her rabbit ears on him though Hajime’s expression became really conflicted when rabbit fur entered his mouth.<br/>
「Although, I wonder what the deal with this is. If those guys above are aiming for this thing, then they surely don’t have any decent thoughts.」<br/>
「Honestly speaking, I just want to leave this thing here untouched, but……it feels like those guys will absolutely reach this far.」<br/>
「Leaving it as it is certainly isn’t a smart plan. Yosh, we couldn’t snatch any precious treasure, but let’s implement that.」<br/>
「The phantom thief "Demon King and Rabbit"! Isn’t it!」<br/>
The highly murderous treasure that was being searched for by a company. There was no way such a thing could just be handed over to them carelessly, so the two of them would take only the metal box with them.<br/>
While they were at it, just like their initial plan, they would leave behind a message that would without a doubt rub the nerves of Wilford and co, who would arrive here with exultation after struggling through mountains of lethal traps, the wrong way.<br/>
Hajime was starting to carve letters using transmutation magic on the wall at the deepest part of the room. Shia was glancing at that while staring fixedly at the completely decayed corpse.<br/>
「You have been all alone all this time in this kind of dark underground labyrinth, haven’t you……Just who and where did you come from? With what kind of feelings were you staying here with I wonder.」<br/>
Somehow the image of the blonde-haired crimson-eyed vampire princess who was her beloved friend and also big sister passed through the back of her mind.<br/>
Shia crouched beside the silent corpse and fixedly stared at the corpse. And then, she suddenly reached out with her hand and embraced the corpse as though she was hugging an ornament. She thought that at the very least she would bury the corpse in the land on the surface near the ruins.<br/>
*gakon-*<br/>
「!」<br/>
「……Shia. What did you do?」<br/>
Shia’s rabbit ears jumped up *usa-!?*. At the same time Hajime, who was in the middle of carving letters, began turning around with a stiff movement like a machine that hadn’t been oiled. His expression was greatly convulsing.<br/>
「N, no, I didn’t do anything……I was just, wanting to bring this corpse-san to the surface――」<br/>
She was thinking of bringing it together with them to the surface……those very kind words were interrupted by the sound of the rumbling ground.<br/>
When Hajime and Shia simultaneously looked at the place where the corpse was at, only the part of the stone paved floor below the corpse was rising up slightly from the other part of the floor.<br/>
No matter how they looked at it, it was a trap that was activated due to a change in weight.<br/>
Even though the trap didn’t move when the metal box was taken, but when the corpse was taken it moved. Hajime and Shia’s eyes were twitching from that fact.<br/>
The rumble of the ground was gradually growing bigger. Suddenly amidst the sound, *slosh slosh* a watery sound was starting to become audible.<br/>
It came exactly from the wall that Hajime was currently carving letters on.<br/>
Hajime returned his gaze to the wall. Water was seeping out from the whole wall. At the same time, *snap-crack crack* cracks were entering the wall.<br/>
「No way」<br/>
「My goodwill is betrayed! Desuu!」<br/>
Hajime’s mouth twitched while Shia tossed away the corpse, and it was at that moment.<br/>
Roaring sound!<br/>
Water flew out with a terrific momentum from the wall that crumbled in one go. The wall’s surface that once consisted of stone soon became a wall of water that surged forward with a vast amount of water. That momentum was like a ruptured dam!<br/>
「Absurd déjà vu!?」<br/>
「It doesn’t need to resemble Raisen’s Great Labyrinth even in this aspect desuuuuuuuu-」<br/>
Hajime and Shia had their feet scooped from under them and washed away by the terrific water current that was like a flash flood. They were pushed out from the room and were washed through the underground labyrinth following the path they came from.<br/>
The two were jostled around inside the water.<br/>
They were restoring their stance somehow while raising their faces to the water’s surface.<br/>
「Puhah. Shia! Are you safeee!?」<br/>
「Kefuu! I’m fine desuu!」<br/>
They confirmed each other’s safety while being washed away. Hajime immediately made his Treasure Warehouse shine to open a gate for escaping quickly.<br/>
But, before he could take it out,<br/>
「Wha-!? Re, retreaaat! Run away! HURRYYYYY-」<br/>
A scream resounded from the front. After looking in that direction, Wilford and others could be seen with convulsing faces! It seemed they had finished the excavation and were advancing through the underground labyrinth.<br/>
They showed their backs in a panic toward the flash flood that was advancing from the front and started running.<br/>
But, there was no way the speed of a human’s running speed could match the speed of a flash flood.<br/>
Wilford and others were swallowed instantly by the violent current. Wilford, who brought his face out to the surface, met the eyes of Hajime.<br/>
「!? The young man from that day!? Why are you here!?」<br/>
「Just passing through.」<br/>
「That’s just too unusual!」<br/>
Whether it was this situation or Hajime’s answer.<br/>
Wilford wanted to question just what was going on, but naturally, he had no such leeway. He was immediately swallowed by the fierce current and submerged once more.<br/>
And then, Hajime too, just before he could take out the Crystal Key because the floor widely opened its lid, was falling right straight down as though being swallowed by the stream of a falling waterfall while yelling 「Aa~!」. Shia too also yelled 「Abaa~!」 while being swallowed by the waterfall.<br/>
All the people inside the underground labyrinth were following the guidance of the water and were washed away somewhere else without exception.<br/>
–<br/>
–<br/>
–<br/>
At the surface near the ancient ruins along the river.<br/>
Suddenly, the shoal on the riverbed near the bank bubbled. *Blub blub blub* Bubbles were being generated intensely.<br/>
In the next instant, a water pillar burst out as though it was piercing the sky. The riverbed was blown apart, and a violent amount of water rose to the sky along with mud.<br/>
And then,<br/>
「DOWAAAAAAAA――!」<br/>
「YAFUUUUUUUUUH!」<br/>
A pair, a man and woman, flew out. The two who floated high in the sky raised a grand scream……one of them sounded cheerful, for some reason, but putting that aside, the two raised their voices while flying out, and then *splosh!* they fell toward the shoal.<br/>
Next, along with screams like 「GYAAAAH」 or 「OH GOOOOOODD」 or 「MAMAA―――!!」, men were flying out one after another.<br/>
They too were falling toward the shoal along the river with *splish splash* sounds.<br/>
「That was a terrible experience. As I thought, it must be that; I’ve gotta reflect a little. I understand really well that I’m omitting various mistakes just because this is Earth.」<br/>
「Ahaha, certainly we might have been a bit conceited there~. But but, personally, I was having a lot of fun in there though! Besides, this time I didn’t drown!」<br/>
「That’s」<br/>
Hajime stood up and wrung out the water from his clothes with a wry smile while Shia was laughing cheerfully and hyperactively.<br/>
There, a voice mixed with groans reached them.<br/>
「Kuh, this is why what is called life is always moving in unpredictable directions……wait, young man! Can I ask you to explain just what in the world is going on!」<br/>
Wilford stood up while spraying water everywhere. The armed men, Brandon, and others, a total of fifteen people who were also washed away together, were standing up while shaking their heads that were choking from almost drowning.<br/>
It seemed that a considerable number of the local people were also safely (?) washed away. They were starting to stand up while groaning and looking at Hajime and Shia with dubious expressions.<br/>
‘Now then, how to answer this’, Hajime and Shia were deliberating while looking at each other’s face.<br/>
「-! You two……what’s that? Where did you find it?」<br/>
Wilford’s eyes narrowed quietly. He was staring hard at the black metal box Hajime was carrying.<br/>
「It’s our lunch box. It will be noon before long after all.」<br/>
「You think there are any lunch boxes that are welded shut!? Your answer is too unusual! Even if you are going to lie, think about it a bit more!」<br/>
Wilford-san unexpectedly might have a straight man attribute.<br/>
Wilford coughed once and calmed his heart somehow, and then he suddenly pasted a cheerful smile on his face and opened his mouth.<br/>
「On this occasion, let’s put aside the fact of who you two are or how you two came ahead of us. Let’s continue the negotiation at the restaurant. Won’t you hand over that box to us? I will pay as much money as you wish.」<br/>
Even after coming this far by spending a vast amount of expenses and effort, at this point Wilford was still attempting to solve it with money. Seeing that, perhaps Wilford could still be called a rational human.<br/>
Although, inside his eyes, a terrifying level of coldness could be seen appearing and disappearing. Most likely, this monetary negotiation was his last warning. Only this time, he didn’t plan to withdraw like the time with the boat negotiation.<br/>
Before giving an answer, Shia asked.<br/>
「Do you know what is inside this box?」<br/>
「Of course I know. How about you two? If not, there is no way you will obtain it this time.」<br/>
「Then, what are Luffy-san and others planning to do with this dangerous object?」<br/>
「Do you mean me when you say Luffy?」<br/>
「What is Luffy-san planning to do with this dangerous object?」<br/>
「No, see, my name is Wilford――」<br/>
「What is pirate king-san planning to do with this dangerous object?」<br/>
「Who are you calling the rub○er man who ate rubber ○bber fruit!?」<br/>
Wilford-san. It seems he was also knowledgeable of subculture. Or rather, perhaps it was a certain work that was too famous. And then, as expected he had a straight man attribute.<br/>
「Cough-. About your question of what I’m planning to do with that, that’s not my place to know. I am just an unworthy company employee. I will even go on adventures if it’s the company’s order, but the result of it will be decided by the company.」<br/>
「Uu~n. A company that knows what is inside this and employs something like an armed group……it doesn’t look like something decent doesn’t iiit.」<br/>
「There is no need for you two to be bothered about that, right? Now, how about we do business here. I will be able to complete my job, and you two will be able to obtain a vast compensation. See, it’s a win-win relationship.」<br/>
‘What to do?’ Shia looked at Hajime questioningly. Hajime shrugged. Shia understood just from that.<br/>
She couldn’t imagine a satisfactory future from handing this kind of dangerous object to this kind of suspicious company. If in the small chance that one day someone related to them got harmed by it somewhere, it surely wouldn’t end with just a regret that made them want to punch themselves.<br/>
They didn’t need money or anything. There didn’t exist any reason for them to hand it over intentionally. After thinking of the worst case scenario, they had a greater reason not to hand it over. Even if for example, the company of Wilford and co was thinking to use it for the sake of some kind of good deed, then they could just investigate it later and hand it to them when it seemed like there would be no problem.<br/>
In any case, it was out of the question to exchange this object for money here.<br/>
「By the way, what will happen if we refuse?」<br/>
「I don’t recommend that. It’s not the smartest thing you could do. Don’t you think so?」<br/>
When Wilford waved his hand, the men readied their guns. Furthermore, the water blast just now must’ve been visible. There was the presence of a lot of people from the direction of the ruins rushing this way.<br/>
「I see, it’s easy to understand.」<br/>
「It’s best to take the simplest approach to everything. After all, a human’s life is already full of unexpected things, even at the best of time.」<br/>
They grinned widely at each other. The smile similarly didn’t reach their eyes at all.<br/>
A moment later.<br/>
A single gunshot instantly rang out. The sound that sounded as though it was slightly lengthened was the proof of a god speed quick draw. Six bullets hit the legs or shoulders of the six armed men directly!<br/>
There weren’t any misses or even any consideration for the opponent’s life in the attack. There was only one aim for this type of shooting. Because the impact shifted the gun muzzle of the men that were shot, the remaining armed men were at the end of the shifted muzzles. The triggers that were pulled reflexively caused the men to attack themselves.<br/>
「Guwah!?」<br/>
「Stupid idiot-」<br/>
Chaos descended instantly. Wilford took out a handgun with speed unbecoming for a businessman. As Wilford aimed at Hajime, Hajime dropped something cylindrical.<br/>
Right after that, *bowanh* an intense white smoke enveloped Hajime and Shia, and their figures were hidden instantly.<br/>
Wilford pulled his trigger repeatedly without minding that. Bursting sounds echoed, and the white smoke was pierced repeatedly.<br/>
But, there wasn’t any scream or the sound of a person falling.<br/>
The wind blew a beat later, and the white smoke was washed away.<br/>
「Chih, they ran.」<br/>
There was no one when the white smoke was cleared. The armed men, for some reason, raised their voices 「Ou! Japanese ninja!」 in high tension.<br/>
「This is not the time for admiration! They are still nearby! If they are running away, they should be using that boat! We are going back to the boats too! Hurry!」<br/>
The armed men moved out in a hurry after hearing Wilford’s command.<br/>
–<br/>
–<br/>
–<br/>
On the other hand.<br/>
Just as Wilford predicted, Hajime and Shia moved to the nearby riverbank, and from there Hajime took out Triana and boarded it to descend the river.<br/>
「How unexpected~」<br/>
Shia, whose rabbit ears were flapping from the wind, was talking to Hajime who was steering the boat.<br/>
「I thought Hajime-san would surely make them all into food for the fish.」<br/>
「Oi Shia. How many times should I say it until you understand? I am an exemplary Japanese person who is virtuous and peaceful y’know. There is no way I’ll mass produce gunshot corpses in a place where there are a lot of locals who are just hired workers.」<br/>
「If you put it another way, if there were no locals, Hajime-san would be an exemplary Japanese person who will slaughter everyone, isn’t it? I get it.」<br/>
It was already exemplary by the point of time he didn’t erase the witness too. Perhaps Hajime personally wanted to say that.<br/>
「And, what will we do after this?」<br/>
「I am intentionally using Triana and not using Gate to withdraw from this area in order to decide that too. Aren’t they going to come soon?」<br/>
The boat’s cruising speed was really relaxed for someone attempting to escape, but it seemed that the reason for that was because Hajime was waiting for the pursuers.<br/>
Shia’s rabbit ears suddenly perceived a motorboat engine sound and the sound of water spraying. Looking back, they could see Wilford and others riding five boats chasing after them.<br/>
The boats were only the high-performance boats that Wilford and co had prepared beforehand, and the people riding it were also only foreigners armed with firearms. It appeared that they left behind the locals because they would only be a hindrance.<br/>
「I see……the witnesses, are gone now.」<br/>
‘Aa~aa’, Shia looked up to the sky with a face that seemed to say that.<br/>
As she continued to stare up into the sky like that, the boats of Wilford and others were closing the distance. And then they mercilessly fired upon Hajime and Shia. *dadada-dadada-* The bullets that were fired from the semi-auto rifles caused splashes of water to start appearing around Triana. <br/>
「Waa~~, they are firing at uuus~, if it is like this then I have no other choice but to lose myself in counterattacking yeaaah~」<br/>
「Uwaa~, that sounds really monotone desuu~. Who are you making that guarantee too? There is a limit even in being shameless you know!」<br/>
Even Shia’s tsukkomi was only treated as a passing wind. Hajime grinned wiiidely while pulling out Donner and pulling the trigger toward the boat that was running parallel to them at the moment.<br/>
There were three armed men riding on the boat. What they were readying to fire were newly made rifles. The bullets of Donner were sent flying straight into the muzzles of the guns as though they were being sucked into them.<br/>
The men’s hands and shoulder areas were turned into pitiful states. Terrible screams echoed between the sprays of water from the river, but Hajime-san mercilessly aimed at the fuel tank and pulled the trigger.<br/>
The bullet that flew in an accurate trajectory toward the tank was a Burst Bullet. The exploding bullet turned the fuel tank into a small explosive and caused a large explosion. The impact caused the boat to somersault, and because the boat was going at high speed, it danced in the air like a leaf fanned by the headwind being accompanied by the blood-soaked men.<br/>
Wilford and co were in a daze dumbfounded while they reflexively tried to escape from the line of fire. They circled behind Triana.<br/>
「I’m glad I brought the sea mine’s complete set. Kaclick.」<br/>
The red button that had ‘Don’t push it! Absolutely don’t push it!’ written on it went *click-*. Countless sea mines were pouring out from the back of the ship!<br/>
Those things that mixed into the jet water current of Triana and flowed backward couldn’t be avoided by the closest boat.<br/>
A thunderous sound resounded along the river. A large boat danced in the air once more. It back-flipped many times. Incidentally, people also flew in the sky. Beautiful, they were drawing a beautiful parabola arc.<br/>
Wilford and others were passing through with convulsing expressions under the arch that was decorated by a boat, a flame blast, water spray, and then men with the white of their eyes bared open.<br/>
「Disperse! Disperse now!」<br/>
Wilford’s angry yell reached Hajime and Shia. Wilford, who always looked calm, now looked desperate.<br/>
Two boats raised their speed and sprang out in front of Triana. The men on board aimed their rifles.<br/>
「Sentori-sensei! Please-」<br/>
「Hajime-san’s tension is high!? Are you that happy that you can use that weapon!? Is that it!?」<br/>
*Gashon-!* Sentori-senseiSentry Gun showed up. ‘Anything and everything that moves will be wrecked, yeah!’ It was as though that volley of bullets wanted to say that!<br/>
「Hiih, get down! Get down!」<br/>
「Get out of the line of fire! Quick-」<br/>
「What the hell is that boat!」<br/>
「Are those two from MI6 huh!? Q must be behind them!」<br/>
A rain of bullets passed by above the heads of the men who flattened themselves on the bottom of the boat. The edge of the boat was pulverized in the blink of an eye.<br/>
「Shit-, if it’s like this, then only desperate measures are left!」<br/>
One person took out a rocket launcher from a box while lying down. And then he took the chance while Sentori-sensei was reloading to stand up, and aimed the muzzle at Triana.<br/>
「……」<br/>
However, he then saw it.<br/>
*Shaaaaaa-* A tubular object heading their way underwater showing glimpses of its figure on the water’s surface.<br/>
‘Eeeeh? I’ve seen that thing somewhere before……wait, NOOOOOOOO-!’<br/>
The man tossed away the launcher and jumped out of the boat without hesitation.<br/>
The men must be excellent mercenaries (?). Their expressions changed when they saw their comrades swiftly escape from the boat wordlessly, and then without hesitation, they similarly jumped toward the river without delay.<br/>
Right after that, the torpedo impacted the boat.<br/>
Two boats, decorated with flame blasts, were now dancing in midair.<br/>
「Is this a joke! Even being unexpected has a limit! Damn it all!」<br/>
Wilford threw his dramatic flair out the wind and evaded the falling boat while doggedly pursuing from behind. He shook the boat left and right diagonally behind Triana while shooting his handgun.<br/>
Surprisingly, regardless of being above a shaking boat, and what’s more while the boat was meandering left and right, his aim was terrifyingly accurate. Even if by mistake it wasn’t a stunt that a mere businessman could do.<br/>
Although, a monster who could easily surpass that terrifying skill was right here.<br/>
*DopaaaN-!* Together with that slightly lengthened gunshot sound, sparks scattered in the air between the last boat Wilford was riding and Triana.<br/>
「……Ha?」<br/>
Wilford reflexively leaked out a stupid sounding voice.<br/>
For the time being, he changed his gun’s magazine and fired three consecutive shots.<br/>
Sparks were generated midair once more.<br/>
After looking carefully, there was the figure of Hajime steering the boat while holding a large revolver in one hand, its muzzle aimed in Wilford’s direction.<br/>
「That’s impossible……」<br/>
Wilford denied the most plausible event by himself. It was only reasonable. Just who in the world would be able to believe that a bullet could be shot down by another bullet.<br/>
「Impossible! That’s not on the level of being unexpected anymore! Eei, you, lend me that!」<br/>
「Ye, yes.」<br/>
Wilford snatched a rifle from the man beside him, and firmly put the stock on his shoulder and fixed it there. Then he fired repeatedly in full auto mode. As though to deny reality, the strength he put into the finger pulling on the trigger was abnormal.<br/>
「Hah.」<br/>
A smile that was obviously fearless even from afar appeared on Hajime’s face. What was pulled out was an even larger revolver. It was directed at Wilford, matching Donner that had been reloaded without anyone noticing.<br/>
Once more there were two lengthened bursting sounds. The number of fired bullets could only amount to twelve.<br/>
In contrast, the magazine of the rifle Wilford was using had thirty shots.<br/>
Even if, for example, an impossible phenomenon occurred, it was obvious which side would win just from the simple difference in quantity.<br/>
Regardless of that, Wilford witnessed it.<br/>
The countless sparks danced madly in midair. And then, the sight of not even a single bullet he fired reaching the target. No bullet even scratched the boat’s frame!<br/>
Furthermore, when he moved his gaze toward an impact sound, there was a bullet hole created in his boat’s engine. White smoke was spewing out. He didn’t know if Hajime intentionally aimed there, but it seemed that even his boat’s engine was destroyed.<br/>
In addition, the action that overturned the difference in quantity was simple. One bullet from Hajime intercepted two~three shots altogether. It was the so-called reflection shot. After a bullet deflected the first bullet, its trajectory would change and deflect other bullets. It was just like playing billiards.<br/>
The sound of the engine stopped, and a voice resounded as if to fill that silence.<br/>
「Now then, self-proclaimed businessman. Won’t you talk a little bit with me?」<br/>
Even though Hajime was reloading slowly, Wilford and his men didn’t have the slightest intention to take advantage of that opening.<br/>
Triana was approaching their boat that was now dead on the water. Hajime-san was grinning widely.<br/>
Although Wilford’s face was absurdly convulsing, he somehow returned a smile.<br/>
「Yes, with pleasure!」<br/>
He responded to the dialogue invitation.<br/>
