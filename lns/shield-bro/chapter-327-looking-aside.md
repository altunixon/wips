I thought the Sheep Rabbit had too many banners to DIO, but I just realized that my website theme supports randomized headers as well. Ah, I’m not touching Rin, and the Akiba Art Magazine girl’s reflection is a pain.<br/>
Chapter 327: Looking Aside<br/>
Raphtalia and the Kitsune woman are exchanging stares.<br/>
From what I see, the Kitsune is but a little girl.<br/>
However, her speech pattern reaks of old age.<br/>
Is she that Loli-baba thing that’s all the rage these days?<br/>
(TL: Loli = Loli, Baba = Baba, I.E. Shiroyasha)<br/>
"Raccoon Wench, do you think you stand a chance of victory with me as your opponent?"<br/>
"I don’t really know. From what I see, you’re a mix between a Fox Race, and a Zveal Race, but what sort of grudge do you hold against me?" (Raphtalia)<br/>
"Foolish Raccoon, who knows not your place, don’t get cocky because you tricked me once before!"<br/>
"… I think I’ve heard a story about that, but you’re looking too far back there," (Raphtalia)<br/>
There is a Demi-Human legend about something like that.<br/>
I looked it up because I wanted to see what sort of Race Raphtalia’s was.<br/>
Apparently, the Raccoons used their magic to… seal a great Youkai of the Fox race through deception. There’s a legend like that.<br/>
They’re still stuck up on that?<br/>
The amount of Tails on the Kitsune woman began increasing.<br/>
Eh? So she’s a nine tailed fox. How grand.<br/>
"That humiliation… I definitely won’t forgive you!"<br/>
"That’s a false accusation, but you made an enemy of Naofumi-sama, and sided with that egotistic sunnavabitch. I won’t hold back." (Raphtalia)<br/>
The Kitsune takes out a slender sword, and gets into position.<br/>
The air resounds with the sound of metal hitting metal. Raphtalia and the Kitsune Woman… Tulna, I think… they use illusions to make clones, and use a wide variety of magic as they exchange blows.<br/>
It would be accurate to call it a battle of deception.<br/>
The moment it looked like Raphtalia had pierced her, Tulna’s sword had gone through her heart.<br/>
Of course, in the end, it was but an illusion, and none of those events actually happened.<br/>
It will be difficult for her to force her way through this fight.<br/>
We managed to cover the level gap with extreme Support Magic, but this woman seems skillful.<br/>
With this, neither side can concentrate on anything but the enemy before them.<br/>
"Rafu~"<br/>
Now then… I wonder if that Kitsune Woman’s noticed that a single animal had snuck onto the battlefield.<br/>
–<br/>
Next is Fohl.<br/>
"If you surrender immediately, I don’t mind forgiving you, Aotatsu woman." (Fohl)<br/>
"What do you think you’re saying to the strongest head of the Aotatsu Tribe? Hakuko… No, from your smell, are you a mix blood? How idiotic."<br/>
"Like I care. I have no interest in my roots." (Fohl)<br/>
Fohl changes to beast form, and holds his front paws out before him.<br/>
I’m worried about just how much of a gap exists between the Four and Seven, but from the look in Fohl’s eyes, it seems that he’ll be alright.<br/>
"Let me show you the true terror of the Aotatsu race."<br/>
The woman opposing Fohl… Nellishen’s Silhouette gradually expands in size.<br/>
"…"<br/>
Eventually, Nallishen changed shape into a large oriental dragon.<br/>
"Throughout our long history, the ones who could take on this form were named chief! Can a Hakuko Mutt keep up with me?"<br/>
"Worthless. Even if I had a form like that, I wouldn’t use it against the likes of you." (Fohl)<br/>
He hits his fists together, and provokes the dragon.<br/>
"Now, Hakuko Hero of the Gauntlet! Let’s put an end to this long cycle of fate! The Aotatsu are the strongest race in the world!"<br/>
Nellishen chants water magic, and smashes it at Fohl.<br/>
Fohl lightly dodges it, and instantly closes in on her. He lands a kick in the center of her face.<br/>
"Were you trying to do something?" (Fohl)<br/>
"DON’T LOOK DOWN ON MEEEEEE!"<br/>
Thunder roars, as bolts of electricity begin raining down on Fohl.<br/>
A race that can use water and wind together… apparently.<br/>
「Erst Rush V」!<br/>
"Uguh!"<br/>
Fohl implants his fist into Nellishen’s abdomen.<br/>
"Ah, ga… gu…"<br/>
Fohl isn’t just some Hakuko kid. He’s the Hero of the Gauntlet.<br/>
I’m doubtful that the Aotatsu chief is a match for the current Fohl.<br/>
With a storming sky as the backdrop, Sadina and that Shatte person exchanged murderous looks.<br/>
From the magic that Nellishen used, the area was now covered in a layer of water.<br/>
Shatte had assumed her battle form, in which she looked like a shark Beastman.<br/>
"Die!"<br/>
Shatte rushed straight forward, and launched an attack. In response, Sadina…<br/>
"You see, this Oneesan is never around when the important things are happening. But I’m glad that this time is different…" (Sadina)<br/>
Sadina takes the tail thrust from Shatte head on, and bends backwards to absorb the impact.<br/>
"Because I couldn’t protect anyone. Because I found my hated enemy." (Sadina)<br/>
"Just how long will you be able to stay on your high horse!?"<br/>
Sadina spits up some blood, and glares at Shatte.<br/>
"Even if it’s me, I’ll never forgive Atlas-chan’s enemy. So please step aside this instant. If you do… you’ll live a little longer." (Sadina)<br/>
Sadina firmly grasped the harpoon in Shatte’s possession with one hand.<br/>
"So before you start regretting standing before me, Noid Kusha halfbreed…" (Sadina)<br/>
Even though her skin was that of a shark, I saw what looked like goosebumps appearing on Shatte. She took a large step back.<br/>
"What will you do?" (Sadina)<br/>
"D… don’t look down on me!"<br/>
Shatte snaps, and swings her harpoon high above her head. She releases a magic attack.<br/>
「Maelstrom Spear」!<br/>
The attack leaves behind swirling trails in the air as it heads towards Sadina.<br/>
"Ah, right. You seemed to be misunderstanding something." (Sadina)<br/>
Sadina casts her favorite lightning magic, and absorbs it into her Harpoon.<br/>
Seeing sparks come from the weapon in Sadina’s hands, Shatte seems dumbfound.<br/>
"Wha… A Luka… used lightning!?"<br/>
"Oneesan never said she was a Luka, you know. I may be closely related, but… please don’t group me with those weaklings." (Sadina)<br/>
Sadina’s lightning impaler, I think it was called, easily pierces through Shatte’s attack.<br/>
"You see, I’m a little angry right now. How long will you stand… as a target for me to take my anger out on? I’m going to fight seriously here." (Sadina)<br/>
Sparks fly around her, and… Sadina does another level of transformation.<br/>
There are plenty of things I’d like to retort here. I was even pretty sure she hadn’t undergone a full recovery yet.<br/>
"Let’s see just how powerful the power Naofumi-sama gave me is." (Sadina)<br/>
She looks like a sea lion. She’s changed into a brown colored monster.<br/>
–<br/>
Last is the mid-air battle.<br/>
That’s the front Ren’s on.<br/>
IT would be a bit dangerous for Gaelion alone, but now they don’t have a chance of failure.<br/>
That’s just how great the difference in power is… with Heroes.<br/>
"I’ll pound the terror of a Dragon Emperor into your body!"<br/>
The giant dragon Reldia spews out a fire breath much more powerful  than the one Adult Gaelion can cast.<br/>
「Mega Prominence Nova」!<br/>
Ren held his sword up high, and cast magic.<br/>
「Revelation Magic Enchant X」!<br/>
The sure-death flames start flowing into Ren’s sword.<br/>
I believe magic enchant was able to absorb magic attacks, and augment their abilities into the sword.<br/>
It appears that dragon breath is included in the attacks it works on.<br/>
「High Quick~」<br/>
「High Quick」!<br/>
Around that battle, zoomed a pair of shadows. It was Firo, and the Gryphon.<br/>
Firo seems to be having an easier time.<br/>
"A flying Filo Rial… They should have died out in the war! How did you survive!?"<br/>
R-really?<br/>
The Gryphons caused the extinction of flying Filo Rials…?<br/>
That’s the first true revelation I’ve had upon coming here.<br/>
Though I think they should just start fighting already.<br/>
"Wrong~" (Firo)<br/>
As they exchange various questions, Firo and the Gryphon circle  around each other, and release various attacks.<br/>
「Dreifach Tornado」!<br/>
「Spiral Strike」! (Firo)<br/>
「Screw Strike」!<br/>
And in another area of the sky, Gaelion started inhaling air, as he prepared to release his breath.<br/>
「KYUAAAAAAAAAAA」!<br/>
It was white.<br/>
I think older Gaelion said something about that.<br/>
About practicing a special sort of breath attack.<br/>
What was it? Something about a difficult attack involving interference, or something.<br/>
Yep, that’s probably what it is.<br/>
"Gu… What!?"<br/>
Reldia seems short of breath as she cries out.<br/>
"Next’s my turn!" (Ren)<br/>
Ren declares as such, and points his sword.<br/>
The blades edge was basked in a red light.<br/>
「Flame Edge, Meteor Sword X」!<br/>
A dark crimson shockwave shot towards the giant Dragon Emperess.<br/>
Yeah, no one here seems to need my help.<br/>
