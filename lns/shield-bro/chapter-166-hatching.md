Chapter 166: Hatching<br/>
We frantically drive the carriage to get away from the broken Motoyasu, and head for our village.<br/>
Paki… paki.<br/>
I hear some sounds from my back. It seems the egg is about to hatch.<br/>
I take it off of my back and examine it.<br/>
"Is the egg ready to hatch?" (Rafatalia)<br/>
"It seems that’s the case." (Naofumi)<br/>
The carriage is shaking. Firo is running with all of her might.<br/>
Well, something terrible did happen to her…<br/>
This egg is much bigger than Firo’s. It’s not big enough that I’d have to carry it under my arm, but it’s about as big as an ostrich’s.<br/>
Cracks begin to spread across the surface of the egg, and from it a small dragon begins to emerge.<br/>
"What do dragons even eat?" (Naofumi)<br/>
"I think it’s probably meat." (Rafatalia)<br/>
"Did we have any meat?" (Naofumi)<br/>
We should have some extra smoked fish and jerky in the store house, so we should be fine…<br/>
"I’ll ask Rat later." (Naofumi)<br/>
"Let’s do that." (Rafatalia)<br/>
Even if she hates it, she will probably talk.<br/>
Taniko has been getting annoying lately.<br/>
"KYUAAAA!" (Dragon)<br/>
The dragon’s head is fully out of the shell. It lets out a cry.<br/>
"Did it hatch?" (Firo)<br/>
"Yeah." (Naofumi)<br/>
How nostalgic. Firo was also born like this… no she was much more energetic than this.<br/>
The dragon chick is about the size of my head. Much bigger than Firo was.<br/>
"Doesn’t it look a little strange?" (Naofumi)<br/>
Its body is charcoal colored with a metallic gloss. On its back are wings way too small for the body.<br/>
Its tail is quite thick.<br/>
It has two horns, and it hasn’t grown any scales yet.<br/>
I try to lift it up and find it to be quite warm.<br/>
"KYUA!" (Dragon)<br/>
It starts blinking and rests its gaze on me.<br/>
"KYUAA!" (Dragon)<br/>
It raises one of its arms as if to greet me, and lets out a sound.<br/>
"What should we name it?" (Rafatalia)<br/>
"What would be good? Let’s ask the villagers." (Naofumi)<br/>
"Fine, let’s decide one together." (Rafatalia)<br/>
"Then should Firo rush to the village?" (Firo)<br/>
"We’re already quite close. There’s no need to rush." (Naofumi)<br/>
It would be troublesome if it died on the ride right after we got it.<br/>
Ah, right.<br/>
I should feed the egg shell to the shield.<br/>
I touch the shell to the shield.<br/>
… bang!<br/>
What? The shield lets out some sparks.<br/>
… series is currently locked.<br/>
Lock?<br/>
Now that I think about it… I raised my level quite a bit, but I haven’t unlocked any dragon-based shields.<br/>
The Zombie Dragon didn’t give me such a shield, and I haven’t met any other dragons.<br/>
I don’t know the reason, but my shield has yet to unlock any dragon shields.<br/>
The closest thing I have at the moment is the Wrath Shield.<br/>
Should I take Rafatalia and Firo to the mountains later?<br/>
I don’t know how well I will be able to fight under this curse.<br/>
However there are many things I need to test out.<br/>
Ah, I forgot because of that incident with Motoyasu, but I have to go to the Castle Town soon.<br/>
I need to get some Dragon Hourglass sand to unlock the Warp Skill, and get some weapons from the Old Man.<br/>
"Fufu… It looks cute. It reminds me of when Firo was little." (Rafatalia)<br/>
Rafatalia gently pokes the baby dragon.<br/>
The dragon grabs hold of Rafatalia’s finger and lightly gnaws on it.<br/>
This is supposed to be an incarnation of carnal lust?<br/>
I better raise it carefully.<br/>
We arrive at the village, and I park the carriage next to Rat’s research lab.<br/>
Rafatalia goes off to talk to the other villagers, and Firo goes off to find Melty in the neighboring town.<br/>
And I walk into the Laboratory.<br/>
"Yo." (Naofumi)<br/>
"Hm? It seems the dragon has finally hatched." (Rat)<br/>
"Yeah." (Naofumi)<br/>
I lift the Dragon up and show it to Rat.<br/>
"Well then, let me give it a medical examination." (Rat)<br/>
Rat carefully examines the chick, and does some light palpations on it.<br/>
"Okay, there are no problems to report. It is a male." (Rat)<br/>
"That’s good." (Naofumi)<br/>
There should be no problems if he gets the ability to turn human like Firo. No, the ability to turn human is a problem in itself.<br/>
"What should I feed him? Is it meat?" (Naofumi)<br/>
"Though it has carnivorous tendencies, it is an omnivore. You can feed it whatever you want." (Rat)<br/>
As Rat begins speaking, the Dragon chick jumps out of her arms and starts climbing up my leg. What is he doing?<br/>
"Is there anything particular I have to watch out for?" (Naofumi)<br/>
"Don’t feed it after midnight. Bad things will happen." (Rat)<br/>
What sort of Demon is that? (TL: Gremlins reference.)<br/>
Is it that one? The one you can’t splash water on?<br/>
"By the way, that was a joke. Well just be careful what you feed it. It might end up chasing you to make you cook more." (Rat)<br/>
"I see." (Naofumi)<br/>
"I recommend taking it hunting soon. The appetite of a growing dragon is not something to be trifled with. You better get it out of the way quickly." (Rat)<br/>
"… Is that something I should worry over?" (Naofumi)<br/>
"Yeah, but Count, most of the kids in your village won’t lose out appetite-wise even to a hungry dragon." (Rat)<br/>
Rat begins talking in a haughty tone. She seems to have arbitrarily come to her own conclusion.<br/>
"What species is this dragon?" (Naofumi)<br/>
"It’s part of the Wyr race. It’s a race with exceptionally high loyalty. It seems to be a mix of a pure-blood Wyr and a Tyrera." (Rat) (TL: ウィル the common romanization of Wyrm without an m. Perhaps It is supposed to be something else.)<br/>
"Tyrera?" (Naofumi)<br/>
"It’s a monster that looks like a giant lizard. They don’t fly but make for good vehicles. Though they aren’t exactly common." (Rat)<br/>
"I see…" (Naofumi)<br/>
I’ve never heard of or seen one.<br/>
"It’s not a monster native to Melromark, so you probably haven’t seen one. I don’t think anyone even keeps one in this area." (Rat)<br/>
"Is that how it is?" (Naofumi)<br/>
"It’s much more common in Faubrey, Shildfrieden and Silt Welt. Its natural habitat is quite limited." (Rat)<br/>
"Hmm…" (Naofumi)<br/>
"Your area of operation is quite small, you know, Count." (Rat)<br/>
"I’m well aware." (Naofumi)<br/>
Don’t stress over things that don’t concern you.<br/>
When the other three heroes were sent to other countries, I had to remain here.<br/>
I never received any international missions.<br/>
If I can make a profit overseas, I should probably consider it but now is not the time for that.<br/>
But I don’t think I will be freed of my work here soon… Perhaps I should let the slaves branch out my company.<br/>
I’ll ask the Queen about it later.<br/>
"So you were over here." (Female Knight)<br/>
Female Knight arrives at the Lab with Taniko.<br/>
"What’s up? Did something happen?" (Naofumi)<br/>
"Well-" (Female Knight)<br/>
"Is this the Dragon child that came from the egg?" (Taniko)<br/>
Taniko interrupts Female Knight and stares intently at the baby dragon.<br/>
"Kyua!" (Dragon)<br/>
The dragon seems to give off a smile. It doesn’t seem to be afraid of strangers.<br/>
"For now, you can go play with the chick. I have some business to speak of with Naofumi-dono." (Female Knight)<br/>
"Ye~s!" (Taniko)<br/>
"Why do you listen to her words, but not mine!?" (Naofumi)<br/>
I’m technically your master, you know!<br/>
… Well, she’ll be taking a burden off my hands for a while.<br/>
I hand the dragon chick over to Taniko and face Female Knight.<br/>
"And? What happened?" (Naofumi)<br/>
"Ah, it seems that the country has sent over a military instructor for you." (Female Knight)<br/>
"Military Instructor?" (Naofumi)<br/>
"You know the definition, right?" (Female Knight)<br/>
"Well, yeah… someone who teaches how to fight, right? I thought you were already teaching the villagers." (Naofumi)<br/>
"You’re not wrong. But the person sent is a specialist in the field." (Female Knight)<br/>
Female Knight seems to want to drag me over to him quickly. She starts explaining the situation.<br/>
"It’s a practitioner of a legendary style, Hengen Musou. That person volunteered to lend Iwatani-dono their power." (Female Knight) (TL: Hengen Musou literally means Unparalleled Transformation)<br/>
"Hengen Musou? What is that? What sort of style?" (Naofumi)<br/>
It sounds like something someone with Chuunibyou would think of.<br/>
"It’s a legendary style that is said to have never lost on the battlefield I heard tales of it while growing up. The last remaining practitioner said that the style was no longer needed in this world, and planned to take it to the grave with them. But after being helped by Iwatani-dono, that person has decided to pass on the legend for the sake of the world." (Female Knight)<br/>
"Hmm… Is it strong?" (Naofumi)<br/>
"Of course. The style has left its mark on the histories of countries around the globe. Just like the Four Summoned and Seven Star heroes." (Female Knight)<br/>
"It’s that famous? It must be an interesting style." (Naofumi)<br/>
"However half a century ago, internal discord caused the death of a majority of its practitioners. Those left all swore to never pass it on. And this is the last practitioner left alive." (Female Knight)<br/>
Really, what sort of style is it? I imagine it coming from a land plagued by bandits.<br/>
Something like that one godly martial arts style. (TL: Fist of the North Star)<br/>
"That person is a famous individual who participated in Melromark’s previous major war." (Female Knight)<br/>
"Who?" (Naofumi)<br/>
"They said they were on friendly terms with you, but…" (Female Knight)<br/>
Who is it? Did I know such a person?<br/>
"If you can’t remember, I think it’s best if you met them. I want to undertake that person’s lessons as soon as possible." (Female Knight)<br/>
By Female Knight’s behavior, a really amazing person must have come.<br/>
Female Knight grabs my arm and begins pulling me away.<br/>
"I’m off. Is there anything you need to report?" (Naofumi)<br/>
"Could you come to see my progress on the Bioplant later? I think you will have to preform a modification on it." (Rat)<br/>
"Understood." (Naofumi)<br/>
"KYUA!" (Dragon)<br/>
"You should… go feed him something. I’m going to take him leveling soon." (Naofumi)<br/>
Taniko, who is cuddling with the baby dragon, nods at my orders.<br/>
I guess she’ll listen to my words this time around.<br/>
She does not protest against the slaying of innocent wild monsters.<br/>
Her philosophy is closest to Survival of the Fittest.<br/>
What exactly is she trying to accomplish?<br/>
"Your name is now Gaelion." (Taniko)<br/>
"Don’t go arbitrarily naming it." (Naofumi)<br/>
"KYUA!" (Gaelion)<br/>
The Dragon chick cries out. Was that a yes, or a no?<br/>
By the way, the villagers had also been trying to think of a name for the baby.<br/>
However after hearing that Taniko already gave it one, they lost interest.<br/>
