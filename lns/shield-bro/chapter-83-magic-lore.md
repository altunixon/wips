Someone said he was working 84, so I’ll skip that for now, but if it’s not uploaded within 24 hours or if he doesn’t contact me, then I will do it myself.<br/>
Magic Lore<br/>
Raphtalia:"Fortunately, the ship did not sink, cast us adrift, and force us to start living on an uninhabited island."<br/>
Naofumi:"Don’t joke about those things."<br/>
Raphtalia:"It wasn’t a joke."<br/>
Naofumi:"Anyway, let’s get to the hotel early today. We can’t start the member change if we don’t know the schedule right?"<br/>
That reminds me, the queen told me to go and greet the one in charge of this island.<br/>
Although this is a remote region, he should have quite a lot of authority since a lot of people visit.<br/>
Mysterious Person:"I welcome the four holy heroes and their companions."<br/>
A suspicious fellow who is holding a flag like a tour guide approaches us, while we wait for the other heroes to recover before departing.<br/>
He is wearing a Melromarc military uniform, and he looks to be a little past middle age……That flag does not suit him.<br/>
Hapenburg:"I am Count Hapenbug, and I have been entrusted with this Cal Mira Archipelago."<br/>
Naofumi:"I-I see……"<br/>
The only hero who is completely fine is me, so I have to respond.<br/>
Hapenburg:"I look forward to our subsequent acquaintanceship."<br/>
Naofumi:"Ah……Best regards."<br/>
Every hero greets Count Hapenburg and the guide employees following him.<br/>
Hapenburg:"Now then, Hero-samas I will tell you all about Cal Mira Archipelago, starting from the beginning."<br/>
Eh……<br/>
He really was a tour guide. This is troublesome and annoying.<br/>
Naofumi:"We did not come here particularly for sightseeing……"<br/>
I would rather not go on a sightseeing tour and learn the island traditions, while there is delicious experience points to be earned.<br/>
Hapenburg:"Now now, since ancient times, the four holy heroes have trained here–"<br/>
While the count explains, we are guided past a market.<br/>
There were some strange objects.<br/>
Is that a penguin, rabbit, squirrel, and a dog with a santa hat? There is a totem pole made of four animals on top of one another and decorated.<br/>
The penguin has a fishing rod, the rabbit is using a hoe, the squirrel has a saw, and the dog is equipped with rope.<br/>
What the hell is that?<br/>
Hapenburg:"Oh? Hero of the Shield-sama has a good eye. Those are the pioneers who developed this island, Pengy, Bunny, Squirrley, and Doggy."<br/>
All Japanese-like. No, it’s probably due to the legendary weapon’s translations.<br/>
Hapenburg:"By the way, the Four Holy Hero-samas were the ones who named them."<br/>
For the Four Holy Heroes naming sense to be-<br/>
Ah, the count is still talking.<br/>
Hapenburg:"The Hero-samas befriended these demons, and gave them names similar to the animals in their world."<br/>
Their naming sense is terrible anyway.<br/>
Couldn’t they have changed a little more?<br/>
Naofumi:"Then, are they somewhere on this island?"<br/>
Hapenburg:" No, when pioneering was completed, they left to look for new land. Afterwards, they were never seen again."<br/>
……In short, they went extinct.<br/>
Also their existence is doubtful. Not to mention, demons pioneering……<br/>
Firo:"Ehh…… they look delicious."<br/>
Firo says while drooling.<br/>
……If I think carefully, this demon gets supreme joy just by pulling a carriage.<br/>
It is quite mysterious.<br/>
Something besides the totem pole catches my eye.<br/>
Naofumi:" What’s that?"<br/>
Hapenburg:"It seems to be an inscription left by the Four Holy Heroes."<br/>
Naofumi:" Interesting."<br/>
I approach it slowly.<br/>
The possibility of the Four Holy Heroes being Japanese is high.<br/>
Even if it’s not japanese, there might be some significant information from somewhere else on Earth.<br/>
It’s not written in Japanese, what is it?<br/>
What……<br/>
Motoyasu:"Oi! This isn’t Japanese. It’s a fake!"<br/>
The other heroes approached the inscription and verify that it cannot be read.<br/>
Hapenburg:"That is strange……There is a tradition that this was prepared for when new heroes would appear……"<br/>
Motoyasu:"……Are you joking? This is a magical letter from this world."<br/>
Magical letter…… This is rather troublesome. Besides me, the other fellows didn’t learn any letters.<br/>
What can I say……The letters change according to the person. Such is the existence of magical letters.<br/>
For example, If I try to read Raphtalia’s magic book on illusions, I won’t be able to decipher it.<br/>
They just become funny words when I translate it.<br/>
However, Raphtalia can decipher it and chant the magic.<br/>
Though there is a common language for magic letters, it is still impractical, and unless you have an aptitude for it, you cannot use it.<br/>
Motoyasu:"Can you read it?"<br/>
Naofumi:"All of you relied on the crystal ball that trash gave, while I didn’t receive any. I had to learn to read."<br/>
Motoyasu:"So what does it say?"<br/>
Naofumi:"Lets see……"<br/>
I read and try to decipher the inscription.<br/>
It is written in unexpectedly simple words.<br/>
"The Hero of the Shield……commands the origin of power. I have read and deciphered a legend. Enhance everything!"<br/>
"Tzuvait ・Aura……"<br/>
I can use it on someone else. Let’s see…..Shall I test it on Firo?<br/>
After waving my hand at Firo, she is coated in a film of transparent magic.<br/>
Firo:"Wa! Somehow Firo is full of power!"<br/>
Firo bounces around.<br/>
Even in her human form she jumps very high.<br/>
The status screen says that all stats have increased.<br/>
Itsuki’s companion:"Aura……Used by the legendary hero. It is an origin magic that raises all abilities."<br/>
Mutters one of Itsuki’s companions in a quiet voice.<br/>
There is such a legend?<br/>
Itsuki:"Awesome! We’ll learn it too!"<br/>
They start trying to read the magic I deciphered together like it’s a game.<br/>
However.<br/>
Itsuki:"Huh……I can’t read it."<br/>
Naofumi:"That reminds me, you guys don’t know the magic language."<br/>
These guys are frustrated, since they learnt magic from the crystal ball easily.<br/>
Itsuki:"Naofumi-san"<br/>
Itsuki turns to me and calls my name.<br/>
Naofumi:"What?"<br/>
Itsuki:"When did you get magic language comprehension on your shield?"<br/>
Naofumi:"I learnt it myself! Don’t depend on your weapon for everything!"<br/>
Itsuki:"So stingy!"<br/>
Motoyasu:"That’s right! Tell us!"<br/>
Seriously, these guys……<br/>
It’s like they have a problem understanding what I say.<br/>
The efforts you put in yourself will show in the power of your weapon.<br/>
Naofumi:"I was able to learn aura magic, but that does not necessarily mean you are able to as well."<br/>
Itsuki:"If you say so. If that’s the case then there should be better magic for us."<br/>
He looks offended.<br/>
The reason is probably from thinking he is beneath me, even though I told him the truth. He was barely able to do anything against the pope.<br/>
He also already lost to me once.<br/>
Naofumi:"So where are we going next?"<br/>
Hapenburg:"Moving along, there are various inns located at Cal Mira Archipelago and the transportation–"<br/>
I will sum up the count’s long story.<br/>
Since Cal Mira Island is active now, the demons are starting to increase.<br/>
Due to the increase in demons, the situation is troubling, so heroes and adventurers are called to subjugate them.<br/>
While we take advantage of the situation to raise our levels.<br/>
That’s why, he would be grateful if we could go get rid of demons as quick as possible.<br/>
It is unnecessary for us to yield for any adventurers, but it would still be better to avoid any possible confrontations.<br/>
……Just like manners in a net game.<br/>
There is always a small boat ferrying passengers across islands.<br/>
Worst case scenario, I should be able to cross it by swimming.<br/>
The hotel prepared by the queen was of the highest class.<br/>
It is better than all the hotels I’ve lived in before…… It could even equal the top-class ones in my world.<br/>
……Was this originally a castle or something?<br/>
Anyway, it was gorgeous and the atmosphere was nice. The walls are made of marble and shining.<br/>
There is a stone statue in the middle that acts as a fountain from my world.<br/>
Did I come to Hawaii?<br/>
There was a luxurious carpet to walk on as we were guided to our rooms.<br/>
The hotel also took responsibility for the luggage and Firo’s carriage.<br/>
Shadow:"Here is the schedule explaining the upcoming events degojaru."<br/>
The shadow that had a familiar speaking pattern was disguised as Melty.<br/>
Naofumi:"Melty?"<br/>
Firo:"Master~, That’s not Melty?"<br/>
Shadow:"That’s right degojaru."<br/>
Naofumi:"You……"<br/>
That’s a confusing disguise. I seriously thought for a second that Melty came.<br/>
I can’t even retort at how she was able to change her height.<br/>
Shadow:"Right degojaru. I was appointed to exclusively help the Hero of the Shield-dono degojaru."<br/>
Naofumi:"I know disguising yourself is your specialty……But why Melty?"<br/>
Shadow:"So that Hero of the Shield-dono will feel at ease degojaru."<br/>
Naofumi:"This makes me feel sick instead, so stop it."<br/>
Shadow:"Understood degojaru."<br/>
The shadow takes of her Melty disguise and returns to her ninja garb.<br/>
It is disgusting seeing an acquaintance’s face getting peeled off.<br/>
Naofumi:"Speaking of which……What’s with the way you talk?"<br/>
Shadow:"Gojaru?"<br/>
Naofumi:"Yea, that."<br/>
Shadow:"Just a habit degojaru. I can stop if necessary degojaruyo<br/>
That reminds me, of when I had a bounty, and that villager in disguise helped me.<br/>
I didn’t notice at all that time.<br/>
Shadow:"This is the result of princess Melty enjoying the way I speak, so I was made her exclusive bodyguard degojaruga."<br/>
Naofumi:"Ah, well it certainly makes you easier to distinguish from the other shadows."<br/>
Shadow:"……You should not believe you can identify an individual shadow degojaruyo."<br/>
What? That is a very suspicious comment. It’s like that shadow at the time was a completely different person.<br/>
Well, if I think about it, then it would be a problem if a shadow could be identified.<br/>
Naofumi:"So you are a different shadow from that one?"<br/>
Shadow:"You are mistaken degojaru."<br/>
Naofumi:"……"<br/>
Pain in the ass-!<br/>
Shadow:" I am just warning you not to identify me with just my speaking habits degojaru."<br/>
Naofumi:"Whatever."<br/>
I don’t intend to learn how to tell you all apart either.<br/>
What I just learned changed nothing.<br/>
Shadow:"Let us continue our talk degojaruka. I will explain our schedule degojaru."<br/>
Naofumi:"Ah……the staff exchange, wasn’t every hero’s agreement necessary?<br/>
Shadow:" Does Hero of the Shield-dono disagree degojaru?<br/>
Naofumi:"No, I don’t……It’s just."<br/>
The other heroes will dislike it.<br/>
I don’t know about Motoyasu, but Ren and Itsuki seem to have a habit of hiding themselves.<br/>
Actually, these guys have no idea of what I was doing<br/>
Also during this event an information leak is unlikely.<br/>
Shadow:"I have already received the approval of the other Hero-donos degojaru."<br/>
Naofumi:"What?"<br/>
Shadow:" I said, I have already received their approval degojaruyo."<br/>
Naofumi:"I see……"<br/>
I am disappointed at how unexpectedly co-operative they are.<br/>
Am I just mistaken?<br/>
Calm down, I didn’t think they would participate.<br/>
Shadow:"The queen has dispatched other shadows to reason with the Hero-donos, and get them interested in the strength of Hero of the Shield-dono degojaru."<br/>
Naofumi:"Well……"<br/>
If I think about it, their companions look down on me. If I perform outstandingly, what would they think?<br/>
Though there has to be a fine line while participating, since the cost of the Curse Series is too big.<br/>
Shadow:"All the Hero-donos are espcially interested in Firo-dono."<br/>
Naofumi:"I see."<br/>
Firo is certainly extraordinarily strong.<br/>
According to Glass’s analysis, Firo’s strength rivals Ren’s, there is also her movement speed and magic.<br/>
Firo:"Fue?"<br/>
Firo who was dozing off beside me, wakes up and looks at me sleepily.<br/>
I mean……All of those guys are interested in Firo……<br/>
That’s a little irritating.<br/>
As expected, it must be a misunderstanding.<br/>
Naofumi:"And? What time will the staff and information exchange take place?"<br/>
Shadow:"I asked each Hero-dono degojaruka. For some reason all of the Hero-donos besides Hero of the Shield-dono wants to do the staff exchange earlier degojaru."<br/>
Naofumi:"……Is information exchange unecessary?"<br/>
I wanted to hear more about the Cal Mira Island’s surroundings…….Though It doesn’t feel good to ask those guys.<br/>
Naofumi:"I would like to exchange information first, some complications might pop-up. Is this request acceptable?"<br/>
Shadow:"It should be fine since the information exchange is done on the day of the staff exchange dogojaru."<br/>
Naofumi:"Understood. So how many days are we staying here?"<br/>
Shadow:"The whole trip is twelve days. Half of that will be the staff exchange degojaru. If Hero of the Shield-dono desires it, the staff exchange can happen immediately degojaru."<br/>
Naofumi:"Well…… it’s a bit early at the moment."<br/>
Shadow:"Time is being wasted you know degojaru."<br/>
Naofumi:"……We just received a sightseeing tour a while ago."<br/>
Shadow:" Can’t be helped degojaru. Since Hero of the Shield-dono still has many things that you don’t know degojaru. I will explain as best as I can degojaru."<br/>
The shadow’s long story goes like this.<br/>
It seems that the staff change includes everyone, but it’s only the hero that moves.<br/>
How the rotation works is, first I change with Motoyasu, second Ren, and third Itsuki. Raphtalia and them don’t move.<br/>
Naofumi:"What kind of punishment game is this to be with Bitch right off the bat?"<br/>
Shadow:" Half a day has already passed since our arrival degojaru. Please consider carefully degojaru."<br/>
Indeed, the time spent with Bitch and her party will be shortest.<br/>
I need to think properly.<br/>
Naofumi:" Then I’m off. You guys do your best too."<br/>
As I walk to the door I pay attention to Raphtalia and Firo.<br/>
Our party will be temporarily disbanded. Well, it’s fine since they are slaves.<br/>
Raphtalia:"Okay……"<br/>
Raphtalia nods uneasily, and Firo doesn’t seem to understand what is happening.<br/>
Naofumi:"You guys are going to Motoyasu. Be careful. That fellow thinks with the lower half of his body. You must never permit it. Firo, if that guy causes a problem just kick him away."<br/>
Firo:"Okay~"<br/>
Raphtalia:"Naofumi-sama……I expected it but……"<br/>
Raphtalia seems to be a little restless.<br/>
Speaking of which, the Hero of the Spear has been our enemy until now. Maybe that guy is trembling in excitement.<br/>
It seems reconciliation with that guy is impossible for now.<br/>
Let’s try to endure and befriend Motoyasu for now while analysing him.<br/>
Shadow:"Then I’ll guide you degojaru."<br/>
With an uneasy feeling that I can’t get rid of……I headed out.<br/>
