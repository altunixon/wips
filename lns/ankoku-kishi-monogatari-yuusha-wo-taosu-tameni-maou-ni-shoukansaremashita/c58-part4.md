Chapter 58.4 : Goddess Of Spider<br/>
◆Dark Knight Kuroki<br/>
「Is something the matter, Rena?」<br/>
After leaving Traid’s fountain, we went to visit Ariadya’s senate building, and Ariadya’s port which was located in the southern part of the city.<br/>
There was a giant cold warehouse located there that was built to store the food ingredients.<br/>
After we enjoyed the ice cream sold around the area, Rena suddenly pulled me to follow her into a desolate alley.<br/>
And then, she quickly pulled off her hood as soon as we turned around the corner.<br/>
「Fuu…. Hiding my face with a hood for a long time is really suffocating.」<br/>
Sure enough, she was wearing her hood ever since we came to this city. That might be the main reason why she feels it’s suffocating.<br/>
However… we’ll be troubled to no end if she doesn’t wear her hood anymore.<br/>
I mean, she’s already a head-turner even with it on.<br/>
The scale would basically explode once she takes the hood off in public.<br/>
Good grief, this Goddess is really troublesome.<br/>
「Are you okay, Rena?」<br/>
And yet, I was still worrying about her. She was a woman before being a Goddess, and I did tell her that I’d become her knight just for today. This is why it’s my duty to protect her.<br/>
「Fufu, I’m just a little bit tired.」<br/>
Rena said as she leaned against me.<br/>
Her moist eyes locked on me while her small and warm breath leaked out from her pink lips.<br/>
The beating in my heart wouldn’t stop when I looked at her.<br/>
Her current expression… was bad for my heart.<br/>
No… she was basically chipping away whatever restraint I had left…<br/>
I don’t think I would be able to hold back if you show me such an enchanted expression, O My Goddess-sama!!<br/>
– What are you waiting for, dude? There’s no one here, it’s your chance.<br/>
The demon and angel inside of me began quarreling.<br/>
The Demon Kuroki said: 「Just do it already! No one can find both of you in this place anyway. Look! The Goddess is clearly asking for it. Rip her clothes and she’s all yours!」<br/>
Meanwhile, the Angel Kuroki voiced out: 「Demon, that’s clearly wrong! A gentleman mustn’t rip a woman’s clothes. Don’t you think that It’s more exciting to do it with her clothes on?!」<br/>
FUU*UCK, THIS ANGEL IS A FU*CKING FALLEN ANGEL! HE’S ABSOLUTELY THE WORST SE*XUAL PREDATOR IN THE WORLD!<br/>
But with my alarm ringing non-stop since a while ago. This was definitely a death flag.<br/>
I mustn’t give in to my lust, otherwise, I’d be dead meat.<br/>
In the first place, I absolutely couldn’t trust this Goddess-sama.<br/>
Rena suddenly made an impish smile.<br/>
My brain was operating at top speed. But honestly speaking, I’m on the verge of giving in to my lust.<br/>
It was during that critical moment.<br/>
The air started trembling.<br/>
「This is…. a barrier?」<br/>
It was created to isolate the space around us from the rest of the world.<br/>
And then, I noticed someone heading towards us.<br/>
「To think that you’d come to a desolate place like this, it’s almost as if you’re asking to die in my hands… Goddess Rena.」<br/>
The one who just spoke was a woman.<br/>
She seemed to be surprised to find me together with Rena. Judging from how the situation was unfolding, this woman was probably the person who erected the barrier.<br/>
Moreover, I knew this woman’s identity.<br/>
「You’re… Atlan-san, right?」<br/>
I’ve already met this woman before, she was Atlan, the wife of Tormalkis, a purveyor of Rena temple.<br/>
She was also the one who prepared an inn for us.<br/>
「Fufufu, I’d recognize you even if you hid your face, Rena! Now, it’s time to vent my thousands years of grudges towards you!」<br/>
Atlan was wearing a stiff smile while announcing. It seemed like Atlan knew Rena.<br/>
I wonder… who was she?<br/>
「Rena, is she… Your acquaintance?」<br/>
Considering this Goddess’ rotten personality, I wouldn’t find it strange for her to have so many enemies.<br/>
「Honestly I don’t really know her either. Uhm, who are you again?」<br/>
Rena looked at Atlan’s face as she asked this question.<br/>
「Fufufu… You don’t know me? Can you say that even after… SEEING THIS, RENA!?」<br/>
Atlan’s lower half transformed after she said these words.<br/>
「A SPIDER!」<br/>
I couldn’t hold myself back from screaming upon seeing this sudden change of the situation.<br/>
Atlan’s lower half transformed into a giant spider’s. Her face also transformed, it resembled that of an insect with sharp fangs growing from her mouth.<br/>
She wasn’t human.<br/>
I raised my vigilance due to this unpleasant premonition.<br/>
The main reason was because I couldn’t see through her disguise before.<br/>
I mean… she looked so much like a human. I never expected that someday I would meet someone whose disguise reached such perfection.<br/>
「No way… You are….」<br/>
Rena seemed to remember something as soon as she saw Atlan’s transformation. As I thought, she probably knew Atlan in the past.<br/>
「Kukuku, surprised huh? Yeah, it’s mo–」<br/>
「… Sorry, but who are you again?」<br/>
I tripped on my own foot after hearing Rena’s words.<br/>
Atlan’s reaction was similar to mine.<br/>
「You fu*cking old spinster! How dare you forget about me! Don’t tell me you forgot about me, Atlankua!」<br/>
Atlan, or should I call her, Atlankua was glaring daggers at Rena.<br/>
「Just kidding, Atlankua. It’s not like I could forget you even if I wanted to… So, is that all you wanted to say?」<br/>
Yeah, they’re acquainted with each other. I wonder what kind of relationship they had in the past?<br/>
「I hate that fucking attitude of yours the most! How can you be so carefree after seducing my HUSBAND!」<br/>
Atlankua was hysteric.<br/>
「Hus… band…? Ah, that persistent god, huh? What kind of misunderstanding do you have? I don’t ever remember seducing him. I should be the one complaining since he kept pestering me.」<br/>
Rena replied calmly, almost like she was too used to this kind of dialogue.<br/>
「MY DEAR HUSBAND WOULD NEVER DO THAT KIND OF THIIIIING! YOU THIEF! YOU VIXEN! YOU THIS VIXEN WHO SEDUCED HIM! DON’T GET CARRIED AWAY JUST BECAUSE YOU’RE A LITTLE BIT MORE BEAUTIFUL THAN ME!」<br/>
Atlankua’s real face was like the combination of a human and insect’s face. If I went by humanity’s standard for beauty, then Rena won by a million miles.<br/>
I’m really curious now, what does her husband look like?<br/>
「If only you’re aware of how ugly your own face is… How about you at least put a bit of effort to look a little bit prettier? Well, it’s not like you can win against me no matter how much hard work you put in.」<br/>
「WHAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAT?!」<br/>
Rena kept smiling happily, while on the other hand, Atlankua was burning with rage.<br/>
Long story short, it seemed that Atlankua’s lover was seduced by Rena in the past. Atlankua was enraged over this matter.<br/>
Even a third party like me was having a headache upon hearing about this drama.<br/>
It’s just too stu— Whatever, it’s not my business anyway.<br/>
「HAHAHAHA, FUGLY SPIDE\~R! FUGLY SPIDE\~R!」<br/>
「KIIIIIIIIIIIIII——————!」<br/>
Rena kept taunting Atlankua while hiding behind me. [TL : What is this? Grade school level quarrel?]<br/>
An elementary student-level quarrel between two Goddesses was unfolding right in front of my eyes.<br/>
If I showed this childish side of Rena to her priests, it might be enough to send them to the afterlife.<br/>
「Uuurgh! Well, it doesn’t matter! Now listen to me, Rena! The one who lured your Hero of Light into the labyrinth is I! And that hero of yours is currently flirting around with labrys’ daughter inside the labyrinth! HAHAHAHA, ISN’T IT VEXING KNOWING THAT YOUR MAN IS STOLEN BY ANOTHER?!」<br/>
Atlankua laughed as she told us this piece of information.<br/>
「I see… So Reiji is…」<br/>
Rena’s tone was held back by emotion. She then glared at Atlankua, the angle of her eyebrows told me that she was truly pissed off right now.<br/>
My heart ached when I saw the expression on her face.<br/>
As I thought, Rena was Reiji’s lover.<br/>
Because she loved him, it was only natural for her to keep worrying about Reiji. Could it be that she suppressed her own feelings and acted like nothing was happening?<br/>
This unpopular me, whose age is equal to almost no girlfriend until just a while ago, couldn’t see through her facade at all.<br/>
I’m starting to regret my previous, rather crude treatment towards her, if only I knew this from the very beginning… I should’ve treated her a bit better before.<br/>
「HAHAHAHAHA, IT’S INFURIATING, RIGHT RENA? BUT YOUR FEELINGS ARE NOTHING COMPARED TO WHAT I FEEL… HUMPH! THAT RATHER HANDSOME “ORDINARY” HUMAN OVER THERE IS MORE SUITED FOR YOU!」<br/>
Atlankua was laughing while pointing at me.<br/>
I felt my heart was pricked when she called me an ordinary human.<br/>
’Ordinary human’ huh…? Yeah, she might be right… I’m just a useless and insensitive bastard who can’t even read a girl’s mood after all…<br/>
「SAY WHAT?! CAN YOU REPEAT WHAT YOU SAY AGAIN!?」<br/>
Rena screamed back at Atlankua.<br/>
「HOHOHO! I’LL SAY IT AS MUCH AS YOU WANT!! THAT FRAIL-LOOKING-STICK-LIKE-MAN-THAT-SEEMS-LIKE-HE-COULDN’T-EVEN-CARRY-YOUR-LUGGAGE IS MORE SUITED TO BE WITH YOU!!!」<br/>
Atlankua pointed at me again.<br/>
…H-How rude.<br/>
I know that I wasn’t handsome, but man, it hurts when someone says those words right in front of me.<br/>
Even if I look like this, I did my best to improve my appearance.<br/>
I always keep myself clean. I also occasionally trim and style my hair, could it be that doing these alone wasn’t enough?<br/>
「We match really well…?」<br/>
Rena’s shoulder trembled.<br/>
Yup, she probably hated the fact that Atlanakua paired her with me. Perhaps everything she did so far—including excessive skinship—was for the sake of saving Reiji.<br/>
When I worriedly looked at Rena’s face.<br/>
She was…. smiling?<br/>
「Uhm… Rena?」<br/>
Why did you look so delighted?<br/>
「WAIT A FUCKING MINUTE! WHAT ARE YOU LAUGHING FOR, RENA!? SHOULDN’T YOU BE GETTING FRUSTRATED SINCE YOUR MAN GOT STOLEN!?」<br/>
「Yeah, you did get on my nerves when you suddenly intruded on our alone time. But… I think you’re mistaken about something, Atlankua. It seems your brain is as rotten as your appearance. That must be the main reason why your husband was cheating on you.」<br/>
Rena declared while looking at Atlankua with piercing cold eyes.<br/>
「KIIIIIIIIIII――――――! HOW DARE YOU! FINE, I’M GONNA KILL YOU! CURSE YOUR OWN STUPIDITY FOR WANDERING AROUND WITHOUT YOUR BODYGUARDS!」<br/>
「No bodyguards…? What a hopeless idiot! If you’re talking about my knight, can’t you see that he has always been by my side since the very beginning?」<br/>
Rena pointed at me.<br/>
Please, don’t get me involved in this stupid quarrel.<br/>
