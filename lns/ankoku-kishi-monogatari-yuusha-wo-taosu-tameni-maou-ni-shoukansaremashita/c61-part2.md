Chapter 61.2 : Evil God Labrys<br/>
WARNING : THIS CHAPTER MIGHT CAUSE SYMPTONS OF BRAINDED!!!<br/>
=====<br/>
「Did we beat him!?」<br/>
Reiji looked towards Labrys.<br/>
But, Labrys rose again, as though nothing had happened to him.<br/>
In the next moment, Labrys’ shield shone.<br/>
It seems that the shield was able to reduce Reiji’s destructive power by half.<br/>
「Gugugu… not bad, Hero of Light. But, this level of attack is only on the level of tickling my skin!!! LABYRINTH, GIVE ME POWER!!」<br/>
The entire room was enveloped by a flash of blinding light, which then gathered around Labrys.<br/>
This feeling was similar to the battle against golem on the 4th floor.<br/>
This might be Labrys’ means to heal himself.<br/>
「I won’t lose as long as this labyrinth exists. You cretins can’t defeat me.」<br/>
Labrys roared as he laughed at us.<br/>
「This is bas–!! Let’s retreat, Reiji-kun!!」<br/>
I screamed at Reiji.<br/>
「Understood!! Everyone, regroup!!」<br/>
Everyone regrouped at once.<br/>
And then, I sang the aria of my spell.<br/>
「NO WAY!? IT DOESN’T WORK!!」<br/>
I was extremely surprised by this fact.<br/>
We couldn’t use teleportation.<br/>
「My bad, teleportation is sealed starting from the 11th floor and below. You can’t run from me anymore.」<br/>
Labrys was smiling delightfully seeing our panicked faces.<br/>
「This is bad, we’re…」<br/>
Nao didn’t need to finish her sentence, I knew she wanted to say “We’re screwed”.<br/>
===<br/>
◆Goddess of Wisdom and Victory; Rena<br/>
The Valkyries and I were waiting on top of Labrys’ labyrinth to welcome Reiji and co’s (supposed) return to the surface.<br/>
「Are you okay, Rena-sama? Reiji and co are…」<br/>
Nier shot a worried look towards the ground while standing atop my warship.<br/>
「What are you worrying about, Nier?」<br/>
「N-NO! I’M NOT WORRYING AT ALL!!」<br/>
Nier replied with a flustered voice.<br/>
Nier’s innocent gestures and demeanor made her an easy prey for any sc*mbag.<br/>
「It’s okay Nier. He(Kuroki) is strong, no one can defeat him.」<br/>
Nier looked at me upon hearing my confident remark.<br/>
「You really trust him(Reiji) isn’t it, Rena-sama.」<br/>
For some reason, Nier’s face became gloomy when she spoke those words.<br/>
「Of course, he(Kuroki) is my knight after all.」<br/>
My knight, Kuroki, was currently infiltrating this labyrinth. That’s why, there was no reason to worry.<br/>
But, Nier was most likely misunderstanding something.<br/>
The other Valkyries were also looking down with worry.<br/>
Should I make myself look like I’m worried like the others as well?<br/>
I went towards the Valkyiries who were looking down in worry.<br/>
「Cease your worry, everyone. Reiji will be okay.」<br/>
The Valkyries smiled upon hearing my remark.<br/>
Did that reassure them?<br/>
「Please return as soon as possible… that girl is coming to get you.」<br/>
I muttered those words while looking at the direction where that girl, Kuna, was coming from.<br/>
===<br/>
◆Silver Witch; Kuna<br/>
「Just a bit more and we’ll arrive at Kuroki’s location, Glorious.」<br/>
I rode on the back of the Demon Dragon, Glorious.<br/>
The ring on my left hand told me about Kuroki’s position.<br/>
I’ve already reached my limit; I’m suffering from a serious deficiency of Kuroki.<br/>
Obviously, I had to ride Glorious, flying here all the way from Nargol, to meet him again.<br/>
「Wait for Kuna, Kuroki.」<br/>
===<br/>
◆Black Haired Sage; Chiyuki<br/>
「I’m almost at my limit, Chiyuki-san.」<br/>
Rino spoke to me with a weary look on her face.<br/>
Even the lively Rino was extremely exhausted. Her cute face was a mess right now.<br/>
Maybe it was supposed to be more difficult for anyone but Labrys to be able to use magic within this labyrinth. I mean, the consumption rate of my mana had far exceeded my predictions. Even Sahoko had exhausted herself after chanting both defensive and healing spells so many times at this point.<br/>
Currently, the only one who was least affected by this situation was Reiji.<br/>
Reiji was currently fighting head on against Labrys. But, it was only a matter of time till he exhausted his stamina too.<br/>
Labrys, on the other hand, could theoretically fight forever thanks to the power of this labyrinth.<br/>
It was the worst possible situation.<br/>
But, we mustn’t give up. We had to continue to fight back alongside Reiji.<br/>
「Stand up, Rino-san. Sahoko-san… we must assist Reiji-kun.」<br/>
I propped my body up to stand.<br/>
I will fight till the end.<br/>
Reiji and Labrys’ fierce combat unfolded again in front of me.<br/>
Reiji hadn’t given up yet.<br/>
He was one to fight regardless of any disadvantage and at the last moment, he would turn the table against his opponents. [TL : IN YOUR DREAM.]<br/>
That’s why I mustn’t give up.<br/>
Both Rino and Sahoko also propped themselves up.<br/>
「W-W-WHAT ARE YOU PEOPLE!!!? HOW CAN YOU STILL FIGHT IN THIS SITUATION!!?」<br/>
Labrys screamed at us in frustration.<br/>
To be honest, he spoke too many lines for a boss.<br/>
「HUMPH, YOU CAN’T STOP US!!!」<br/>
Reiji flashed a refreshing smile as he readied his two swords.<br/>
Labrys becamse increasingly irritated upon seeing him prepare for another clash.<br/>
「SUIT YOURSELF THEN!! I ACTUALLY RATHER RELUCTANT TO USE THIS MOVE BUT, ALL OF YOU CRETIN MIGHT BE AS WELL DISAPPEAR ALTOGETHER!!!」<br/>
Labrys’ body suddenly turned red.<br/>
「No way, he was just playing around until now!!!」<br/>
Nao voiced her surprise.<br/>
Even I couldn’t believe it. Did he still have an ace in the hole?<br/>
「O FLAME OF MOROK DWELLING IN MY BODY!! REDUCE EVERYONE IN THIS ROOM TO ASHES!!」<br/>
Labrys’ body was wrapped in blazing flames as soon as he finished his chant.<br/>
Within the next moment, the flame exploded outwards, burning everything in this room.<br/>
「O LIGHT!!!」<br/>
Sahoko used every last bit of her mana and deployed a defensive spell.<br/>
That light wrapped our body, protecting us from the blazing flame.<br/>
「THANKS, SAHOKO-SAN!!」<br/>
I looked at Sahoko’s direction.<br/>
Sahoko replied with a frail smile on her face.<br/>
It seems she’d exhausted herself from using this magic.<br/>
「KYAAAAAAAAAAAAAA!!!」<br/>
「NOOOOOOOOOOOO!!!」<br/>
Various desperate screams of pain resounded from behind Labrys.<br/>
It seems that his flames had also attacked the women behind Labrys.<br/>
They tried to escape, only to become human torches till they were burnt black beyond recognition.<br/>
「DEAR!! WHY ARE YOU KILLING YOUR WOMEN TOO!!?」<br/>
「HUMPH!! KNOW YOUR PLACE, YOU LOWLY S*W!!! I JUST NEED TO FIND NEW ONES!!」<br/>
Labrys replied with a bored face.<br/>
「YOU BAST*AAAARD!!!」[TL : YOU TOO!!!]<br/>
I shouted at Labrys.<br/>
Unforgivable.<br/>
「EURIA!!!」<br/>
Reiji was running in a hurry toward Euria’s position.<br/>
He was barely able to save Euria from the flames by a hair’s breadth.<br/>
Reiji came back towards us while holding Euria in his embrace.<br/>
「Why did you save me, Reiji-sama? I’m an evil woman who tricked you.」<br/>
Euria looked at Reiji with a puzzled look on her face.<br/>
「Don’t worry about it, Euria. I never abandon my woman.」[TL : WHAT ABOUT WHEN YOU ALMOST LEFT CHIYUKI AND NAO DEAD IN ROC KINGDOM? D*CK HEAD!!]<br/>
Reiji flashed his usual refreshing smile.<br/>
「Reiji-sama…」<br/>
Euria looked at Reiji with tears overflowing from her eyes.<br/>
I glared at Reiji upon seeing those.<br/>
I don’t mind that he wanted to save her but, you should at least worry about Sahoko whose burden has now only increased with another person to protect now.<br/>
Are you even aware of that? [TL : No, his brain is trapped in his d*ck after all]<br/>
「My Morok Flame won’t cease to burn as long as I have mana. Let see how long you can survive under this kind of situation.」<br/>
Labrys came at us again.<br/>
Reiji faced off against Labrys again after setting Euria’s down.<br/>
I tried to invoke ice magic to counter the blistering heat, but my magic wouldn’t invoke no matter how hard I tried.<br/>
I glanced towards Rino. It seems she can’t use her spirit magic either.<br/>
The reason behind that was most likely the Morok Flame. [TL : I’m tempted to change “Morok Flame” to “Moron Flame”]<br/>
Through this, Labrys had literally blocked everyone but Reiji’s combat powers.<br/>
「No one can protect you anymore, Hero!!」<br/>
「So what!! I alone am enough to kick your a*s!!」<br/>
Their battle began anew.<br/>
The rest of us couldn’t do anything but be forced into being passive onlookers of their battle.<br/>
I felt really frustrated at seeing our current situation.<br/>
「HOW!! HOW CAN YOU STILL FIGHT!! HOW CAN YOU STILL FIGHT IN THIS KIND OF HOPELESS SITUATION!!」<br/>
「MY WOMEN ARE RIGHT BEHIND ME!!! LIKE H*LL I’M GONNA LET THEM SEE AN UNCOOL SIDE OF ME!!」<br/>
「THEN THOSE WOMEN OF YOURS WILL DIE FIRST!!!」<br/>
Labrys pretended to look at Reiji as he dashed toward us.<br/>
「EVERYONE SPREAD OUT!!」<br/>
Every one of us spread out in different directions upon hearing my command.<br/>
The most I was worried about was Sahoko, but, seeing her escaping along with Nao to a safe location, I heaved a sigh in relief.<br/>
「NO\~\~\~\~\~! DADD\~\~\~\~\~Y!!!」<br/>
Euria screamed to the top of her lungs.<br/>
Labrys was clearly aiming for Euria.<br/>
「YOU B*STAAAAAAAAAAAAAARD!!!」<br/>
Reiji sprinted at unbelieveable speed and arrived in the nick of time in front of Euria to protect her from Labrys’ flame.<br/>
Euria’s legs turned jello as she fell on her butt. Honestly, she was only a hindrance.<br/>
Reiji became a target for Labrys’ attack since that useless Euria couldn’t move at all from her spot.<br/>
Though Reiji could fend off Labrys’ attack with his two swords, his situation turned for the worse.<br/>
「UWAAAAAA!」<br/>
One of Reiji’s swords broke, and he was blown back along with Euria.<br/>
「Reiji-kun!!!」<br/>
I squeezed every single bit of my mana and fired mana bullets at Labrys.<br/>
I have to distract Labrys away from Reiji.<br/>
So, I kept firing mana bullets at Labrys.<br/>
「YOU B*TCH!! I’LL KILL YOU FIRST!!」<br/>
Labrys’ attention finally shifted from Reiji.<br/>
Now I just need to keep moving.<br/>
「… Eh?」<br/>
I fell back to the floor when I tried to stand up. I… couldn’t move my body.<br/>
「Mana… exhaustion.」<br/>
I couldn’t gather mana in my body.<br/>
Even my legs refused to move.<br/>
「Chiyuki-san!!!」<br/>
Though I could see Nao sprinting as fast as she could in my direction, the distance between us was simply too large. She won’t make it in time.<br/>
Labrys was already swinging down his tomahawk.<br/>
I saw the tomahawk approach me in the world of slow motion.<br/>
What this… the end of me?<br/>
Tears welled up in my eyes as I faced my end.<br/>
Someone, please save me.<br/>
I couldn’t help but ask for someone to save me.<br/>
I instinctively closed my eyes.<br/>
「MOOOOOOOOOOOOO!!!」<br/>
Suddenly, Labrys let out a pained scream.<br/>
His tomahawk had missed its target.<br/>
When I opened my eyes, someone wearing black clothing stood before me.<br/>
I caught the sight of Labrys thrown quite far away from me.<br/>
It seems my savior hit Labrys with his full power.<br/>
「Are you okay?」<br/>
The man in black clothes asked me.<br/>
I’ve heard this same voice before. It was the same voice of that person who saved my life back in Rox kingdom.<br/>
He turned around, and looked at me.<br/>
「You are…」<br/>
What was this person doing in this place?<br/>
Why did he save me?<br/>
My train of thought was frozen in that very moment.<br/>
「Please get back, leave the rest to me.」<br/>
His body then wrapped itself in a black flame.<br/>
When the black flame dissipated, his figure was replaced with the Dark Knight donned in jet black armor.<br/>
Then I noticed.<br/>
The one who saved me back in Rox kingdom was him, the Dark Knight.<br/>
