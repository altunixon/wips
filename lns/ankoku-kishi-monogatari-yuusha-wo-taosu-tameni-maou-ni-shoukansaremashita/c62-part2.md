Chapter 62.2 : Rondo of Light and Darkness<br/>
Note : Real Man save the day, while others were busy with their own.<br/>
===<br/>
「WHAT ARE YOU DOIIIING!!!」<br/>
I stood firm in front of Labrys, preventing him from returning to the altar.<br/>
「My bad, you won’t pass me!!」<br/>
Suddenly, the room was enveloped with a flash of brilliant light. When the light receded, we were no longer in the same room.<br/>
「This place is?」<br/>
Labrys surveyed his surroundings.<br/>
Our current location wasn’t Labrys’ room on the 13th floor of the labyrinth. We had been transported to the surface part of the labyrinth.<br/>
「Emergency Transfer Magic. This was the emergency escape device made by Heybos on the 13th floor in case the labyrinth is under attack. You should know about it.」<br/>
I spoke as I pointed my sword at Labrys.<br/>
Normal transfer magic couldn’t be cast on the 13th floor, but, an emergency measure had been installed in that area.<br/>
When the magic installed in the altar behind Labrys’ throne was activated, every living being in the throne room on the 13th floor of the labyrinth would be teleported to the surface.<br/>
「Now you can’t recover from your wounds anymore!! Nor will we let you escape!! It’s checkmate, Labrys!!!」<br/>
===<br/>
◆Sword’s Maiden; Shirone<br/>
Everyone got teleported to the surface after I activated the emergency escape magic within the altar.<br/>
This was the previous arrangement that I’d made with Kuroki.<br/>
Labrys could gain infinite power while he was in his labyrinth. That’s why we had no no choice but to drag him out of that place. In order to do that, Kuroki and I decided to use the emergency teleportation device which we’d found in the labyrinth’s blueprint.<br/>
We split our jobs. Kuroki would distract Labrys while I would wait for the chance to rush in at once towards the altar and activate the teleportation device.<br/>
Everything was going according to plan.<br/>
Just as intended, we were teleported into the plaza of the ruined metropolis on the surface floor of the labyrinth.<br/>
After flying a full rotation in the sky, I descended before Chiyuki and co.<br/>
「SHIRONE-SAN!!!」<br/>
Chiyuki-san called out to me.<br/>
「Everyone, thanks god you’re alright!!」<br/>
I looked at everyone’s faces. They looked tired, but they were safe and sound at least.<br/>
「Yeah, I’m okay Shirone-san. Thanks to him.」<br/>
Chiyuki-san was looking at Kuroki.<br/>
The fight was still going on.<br/>
Kuroki and Reiji-kun were still fighting against Labrys.<br/>
But it was obvious. We’d already won.<br/>
「They’re amazing, Shirone-san!! Their movement was completely in sync!!」<br/>
Nao-chan called out to me with an excited voice.<br/>
「Yeah. Even though this should be their first time fighting side-by-side…」<br/>
I’d seen them fight back in the throne room as well. Honestly, seeing their united front left me in awe.<br/>
This was the scene that I’d always been waiting for.<br/>
At that moment, the sky suddenly brightened.<br/>
We looked up to see what was causing the phenomenon. There we saw a giant ship floating up in the air. The ship was being escorted by female angels who were flying around it.<br/>
At the bow of the ship, I spotted someone standing tall while looking down.<br/>
「Is that, Rena?」<br/>
The one who was standing at the bow of the ship was the Goddess Rena, armed to a T.<br/>
===<br/>
◆Dark Knight; Kuroki<br/>
The shining ship stopped in the air right above the labyrinth. Standing at the bow of that ship was Rena, fully armed with a shield and spear.<br/>
Maybe she’d been standing by above the labyrinth this whole time.<br/>
It seems that she ordered for the ship to descend after we were teleported outside. The battle between me, Reiji, and Labrys stopped for a moment as we looked up at the sky.<br/>
「It’s been a while, Labrys.」<br/>
Rena laughed kindly.<br/>
Though she was quite far away, I could see her face just fine thanks to my enhanced vision. It seems that the same went for Reiji and Labrys.<br/>
「R-RENA!!! DID YOU COME FOR ME!!? ARE YOU GOING TO ACCEPT MY PASSIONATE LOVE!?」<br/>
What the hell is this guy going on about?<br/>
「Sorry, Labrys. My love is just for him. That’s why I’m not coming for you.」<br/>
Rena flat out rejected him, making him look over at Reiji and I.<br/>
「SO YOU CHOOSE THAT MAN FROM SPIRIT WORLD!!!」<br/>
Labrys screamed at the top of his lungs.<br/>
「That’s right, Labrys. I love that man who hails from the spirit world. I have a hard time sleeping at night every time I think of him.」<br/>
Rena flashed an extremely charming smile as she spoke.<br/>
Her eyes were that of a woman in heat.<br/>
The confession of the Goddess of Love resounded in the vicinity of the area. Reiji, who was standing by my side, laughed at hearing her confession.<br/>
Rena was a beautiful Goddess. No man would dislike receiving a confession of love from such a beautiful Goddess.<br/>
「YOU FU*CKER!!! DI*EEEEE!!!」<br/>
Labrys lunged towards Reiji to attack, only for Reiji to dodge it with ease.<br/>
「What a petty man you are, Evil God Labrys!!! Getting jealous and attacking a man just because the Goddess you love won’t spare a glance at you!!! If you’re a man, back off when she rejected your confession and wish for her happiness!!!」<br/>
Reiji spoke confidently to Labrys and laughed at the latter, as he dodged Labrys’ attack.<br/>
「SHUT UUUUUUUUUUUUUUP!!!」<br/>
Labrys became even more enraged as he launched another attack at Reiji.<br/>
「Come at me, Labrys!!! I love the moment when I turned the table against a man like you!!! And let me to show you the difference between us!!」<br/>
With that, the second round of their fight began. Shirone and the other girls in the back were also covering for him. The angels in the sky also joined in the fray to attack along with Reiji.<br/>
Labrys had lost.<br/>
I separated myself from them.<br/>
No need for me to fight anymore. I’ve already saved Nut so I’ve accomplished my original mission here. In the first place, I had no reason to join the fray and help that raijuu.<br/>
「DIEHART-SAMA\~!」<br/>
Nut ran towards me. He’d gotten teleported to the surface too.<br/>
「Do you want to returning ahead to Nargol, Nut?」<br/>
「Returning ahead?」<br/>
「Yeah, it seems Kuna is on the way toward this place. That’s why I’ll go to meet her.」<br/>
I looked at the ring on my finger on my left hand.<br/>
It seems that Kuna couldn’t hold herself back anymore and decided to come instead.<br/>
「Understood. Leave the report to Your Majesty to me.」<br/>
「Thanks, Nut.」<br/>
Nut then commenced with activating the magic tool to start teleporting.<br/>
I looked over at the battle between Labrys and the Hero and co.<br/>
Labrys was powerful even without the power of his labyrinth. Nevertheless, he was being cornered bit by bit.<br/>
「Time to leave I guess… They doesn’t seems to need my help anymore…」<br/>
When I was about to take my leave, I felt something was coming towards us at a breakneck speed from the center of the mountain range.<br/>
I turned around and struck down the thing that was about to hit Rena who was standing on the bow of her ship.<br/>
The thing I’d struck down was a spear.<br/>
The spear returned to where it’d come from after I struck it down.<br/>
I quickly landed on the magic ship as it did.<br/>
Cra*p, my body moved on its own even though I never wanted to save her.<br/>
「Thank you for protecting me, Kuroki.」<br/>
When I looked around, I realized that no one was left at Rena’s side. Everyone was fighting against Labrys.<br/>
I really wanted to smack those angels on the head and tell them “at least leave some people around her if you want to protect her, fools!”<br/>
Thanks to their blunder, I ended up saving Rena’s life instead.<br/>
I looked at the direction from where the spear had come from. There, I saw a giant bird in the middle of the mountain range heading our direction.<br/>
「Roc… what is that bird doing here!?」<br/>
Rena spoke with a surprised look on her face.<br/>
Roc was a giant bird who lived in the southern part of the continent. They weren’t supposed to exist in this place.<br/>
Upon closer inspection, I could see someone on the top of that Roc.<br/>
「Is that Zarxis? It seems there’s another person beside him… Rena, do you know the other person?」<br/>
There were two people standing atop the Roc. One of them was Zarxis. THere was no way I could forget the appearance of his ominous mask.<br/>
And there was another woman-like figure besides him.<br/>
That woman-light figure was donned in red vestments while she held a spear in her right hand.<br/>
Was she the one who threw that spear towards Rena?<br/>
Though the woman-light figure had the appearance of a human, I knew that she wasn’t a human since she could stand side-by-side like that with Zarxis.<br/>
「No way… Serpent’s Queen, Diadona. What she’s doing he—」<br/>
Rena’s eyes opened wide as soon as she saw the woman on top of Roc.<br/>
The Serpent Queen, Diadona. I’d heard of her before. The Goddess who was worshipped by the Lamia tribe and the Gorgon tribe who inhabited the archipelago in the southern sea.<br/>
She was also the loyal subordinate of the Goddess of Destruction, Nargol.<br/>
Similar to Zarxis, she should hate Modes as well.<br/>
The Roc stopped in midair after reaching a certain distance away from us.<br/>
Everyone below stopped fighting as soon as they saw the giant bird.<br/>
「We came to bail you out from this place, Labrys!!」<br/>
Diadona descended from the back of the Roc. She took off her vestments as she fell to the ground. A pair of giant bat-like wings grew from her back as her lower limbs transformed into that of a serpent. A pair of giant bat-like horns grew from her head while her eyes shone a golden color.<br/>
「Not so fast!!! My Shield!! Unleash your true power!!」<br/>
Rena held up her shield, pointing it towards the sky. As soon as she did, the shield cast off a blue light.<br/>
Diadona’s eyes shone even brighter as her surroundings were enveloped by golden light.<br/>
「What the he*ll is that?」<br/>
The powerful light magic blinded our eyes, preventing us from being able to see our surroundings.<br/>
