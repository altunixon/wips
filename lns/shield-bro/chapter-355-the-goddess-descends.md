Chapter 355: The Goddess Descends<br/>
<br/>
The air reverberates as if the entire world is trembling. All clouds in the sky are blown away.<br/>
Hearing the rumbling, I promptly stand in front of everyone to protect them from what’s to come.<br/>
Just doing this won’t save anyone from a crumbling world, but even so, I’ve…<br/>
"No one step in front of me!"<br/>
I’ve decided to protect them.<br/>
Even through the inevitable collapse of the world as we know it.<br/>
No matter what happens, until my body erodes away.<br/>
The crack fills with light, and everyone shuts their eyes.<br/>
Ku… I wonder what sort of thing the collapse of the world is.<br/>
Like Glass said, will all life be sucked away, leaving this world an empty shell?<br/>
Or it could just be darkness… a black hole-like thing could appear to reduce everything to nothingness.<br/>
Anyways, right now… I’ll just have to pray for a miracle.<br/>
As I think that, strong blasts of wind hit my body… I continue to stand before the blinding light.<br/>
Eventually…<br/>
The earthquake stops, and I focus my eyes.<br/>
"Wha…"<br/>
Before me is an unfamiliar land; an assimilated world stretches across the landscape.<br/>
But, perhaps you can say I’ve seen it once before.<br/>
"This is-"<br/>
Glass is dumbfound.<br/>
Right… without the world falling to ruin, the assimilation ends.<br/>
"See? The wave wasn’t going to destroy the world!"<br/>
The reincarnators hold their weapons out at us and direct their hostility.<br/>
What does this mean?<br/>
We take on our battle formation as we glare at our enemies.<br/>
The Hourglass in my vision has stopped moving. It’s completely silent.<br/>
"Now, it’s time for the Goddess to come down!"<br/>
One of the reincarnators shouts out, and Witch MKII begins releasing a faint light.<br/>
"Eh?"<br/>
Witch MKII closes her eyes, and without the light showing any signs of dying down, she starts to float.<br/>
And the light converges… as if radiance is being gathered from every corner of the globe.<br/>
"Ah!?"<br/>
Glass raises her voice.<br/>
"What’s wrong!?" (Naofumi)<br/>
"All the Soul Eater monsters under my control have mysteriously perished!" (Glass)<br/>
What!?<br/>
When I look to the sky… various clumps of light arrive and surround Witch MKII.<br/>
Eventually, many balls of dazzling light have gathered, and MKII disappears into a mass of light herself.<br/>
"Mary!"<br/>
The reincarnators call out her name.<br/>
Soon, the gathered light disperses… Standing there, is a familiar, yet unfamiliar… woman. She floats in space.<br/>
"Oh… my Goddess."<br/>
"Everyone, I offer you my deepest thanks. Because of all of your efforts, I can finally return to this land."<br/>
The reincarnators and their comrades silently look upon the scene.<br/>
… It’s that. The atmosphere where a powerful person joins your party.<br/>
Does that make this the birth of an ultimate enemy for us?<br/>
This may have become a heated scene in Manga or Games, but since we’re on the enemy side, the only thing that really comes to mind is, ‘what sort of bullshittery is this?’<br/>
"For Mary to be the Goddess…"<br/>
"Did I surprise you? In order to assist you, I let fragments of my soul be born into this world. They had not my memory, but I truly was close to all of you."<br/>
"!?"<br/>
Fragments…?<br/>
I have an exceedingly bad feeling about this.<br/>
The one before us who proclaims herself a Goddess… I could guess just what sort of being existed as her foundation.<br/>
No… perhaps it would be better to say that everything was connected.<br/>
The discomfort I’ve been feeling until now was all caused by this.<br/>
The Goddess turns to us and greets us.<br/>
"It’s a pleasure to meet you. No, perhaps I should say we’ve met many times before? I am Medea Pideth Machina. You are the ones who put one of my fragments, Malty, through quite a uncomfortable time, are you not?"<br/>
"M-Malty!?" (Trash)<br/>
Trash’s voice resounds out.<br/>
Right, when you look closely, the woman who calls herself Medea resembles Witch to some extent.<br/>
"Trash, calm down!" (Naofumi)<br/>
"Y-yes!" (Trash)<br/>
"Ah, how cowardly were these people when they used their cruelest methods to torture a fragment of my being, only to execute her in the end. How pitiful an end." (Medea)<br/>
In a manner that showed she was making a play for sympathy, Medea weeps to the reincarnators while pointing her finger at us.<br/>
"I definitely cannot offer salvation unto you. For people like you, I cannot offer forgiveness as one who holds the title of god."<br/>
… Her eyes are laughing.<br/>
My memories whisper to me. Those are the eyes Witch made whenever she tried to fool someone.<br/>
I see. So Witch’s true identity was a fragment of a Goddess’s soul.<br/>
So that’s why she developed a personality unbecoming of the child of the Queen and Trash.<br/>
From the start, she was merely the being trying to lead the world to ruin. No matter how hard you tried to fix her, she wouldn’t change.<br/>
Perhaps the order engraved on her heart was to torment the Heroes, or to covet luxury and cause the declination of the world.<br/>
"Trash… please understand. The person who was once your daughter is now the enemy of the world. Don’t forget it." (Naofumi)<br/>
"Papa, I’m over here!" (Medea)<br/>
With a perfect imitation of Witch’s voice, Medea calls out to Trash.<br/>
"How dare you order my execution. Even though you were my father! I definitely won’t forgive you."<br/>
"A-ah…"<br/>
Trash begins trembling.<br/>
The fear of having the daughter he killed come back… Is it?<br/>
For Trash, who cares deeply for his family, this must be torture.<br/>
"Trash! Get yourself together! What about the country your beloved Queen left behind.. and what do you think will become of Melty!?" (Naofumi)<br/>
"…!"<br/>
Having regained his senses, Trash begins glaring at Medea.<br/>
"Now, everyone! Let us defeat the enemy of the world!" (Medea)<br/>
"Yeah~!"<br/>
The reincarnators raise a loud cry, as they point their varied weapons at us.<br/>
Behind them, lending them power, is an army from Glass’s World.<br/>
Is this… an All-Out War!?<br/>
Damn! Having come all the way here, we get wrapped up in this pointless battle.<br/>
But, I can’t be swayed here.<br/>
I just have to play my part. The Leader of my army. A Hero. Whatever works best. Just play the part.<br/>
Or else, we really will lose.<br/>
"We’re intercepting them!"<br/>
"Understood!"<br/>
We also raise our voices and begin our clash with the opposing army.<br/>
One runs ahead of everyone, capturing his enemy’s attention…<br/>
"Die! You heartless Heroes!"<br/>
A reincarnator… one holding a katana rushes at us.<br/>
"There!" (Naofumi)<br/>
I grab the blade with one hand to stop it.<br/>
"W-what!?"<br/>
"What sort of half-assed strengthening are you using?" (Naofumi)<br/>
Can we win like this?<br/>
Even if the Enemy’s general went out of her way to appear, that doesn’t mean they got any stronger.<br/>
"Motoyasu!" (Naofumi)<br/>
"I know! 「Brionac X」!" (Motoyasu)<br/>
Motoyasu’s spear of life pierces the reincarnator.<br/>
"GUHAAAAAAAH!"<br/>
Damn… he isn’t dying.<br/>
I believe there is a guy who specialized in defense among them.<br/>
"Dammit, they’re closing in!"<br/>
"Ren, Raphtalia! Go pincer them!" (Naofumi)<br/>
"Got it!" (Ren)<br/>
"Yes!" (Raphtalia)<br/>
"Rafu~!" (Raph-chan)<br/>
Ren and Raphtlaia, and also Raph-chan, draw closer to them and unleash consecutive attacks on their members.<br/>
"Ugu—gu…"<br/>
"Trash, from the rear, prepare ritual magic and continuous support fire!" (Naofumi)<br/>
"Understood!" (Trash)<br/>
By my order, Trash prepares the rear forces to use Ritual Magic and loads the magic into Fitoria’s Vassal weapon tank.<br/>
Of course, the original she copied it off of, Mii-kun, is there too.<br/>
「Lightening Impact Whip X」!<br/>
「KYUAAAAAAAA」!<br/>
A flexible whip coated in electricity repeatedly snaps at the enemy, and to match her, Gaelion breathes flames to envelop them.<br/>
Taniko and Gaelion’s combination is in good shape.<br/>
「Spiral Claw Ten」!<br/>
「Dragon of Ruin Inferno Fist X」!<br/>
The ones that approach Firo are relentlessly mowed down by her spiraling claw motions, and those that dodge are pummeled down by Fohl’s fist.<br/>
Good, the enemy’s formation isn’t complete.<br/>
I’ll bet they never met to discuss their strengthening methods.<br/>
"Arara… then I guess there’s no helping it." (Medea)<br/>
Medea gently raises her hand and snaps her finger.<br/>
「Eternal Blessing」<br/>
The reincarnators and their allies are covered in a rain of light.<br/>
And right after that—<br/>
"Gu…"<br/>
The attacks I take suddenly become exponentially heavier.<br/>
Is it support magic?<br/>
But what I’ve cast on us is Revelation Aura X, you know.<br/>
Up until now, we’ve always had some room for leisure, but right now, the most I can do is endure it.<br/>
That means Ren and the other Heroes, as well as those in the rear, won’t be able to take these attacks.<br/>
"I offer my deepest thanks, Goddess!"<br/>
The Reincarnator turns to Medea, and offers thanks before glaring at me.<br/>
"Take this! 「Cold Steel Vital Wave」!"<br/>
"Too soft!" (Naofumi)<br/>
From his katana, a wind-themed blade of light comes flying.<br/>
I take his attack and redirect it… towards the one who is fighting Ren.<br/>
Ren’s always made a habit of observing his surroundings. Noticing the sword wave flying towards him, he jumps back.<br/>
And the sharp edge tears the one who could make absolute defense barriers to shreds.<br/>
"Guhah!?"<br/>
Uwah. His legs are sent flying…<br/>
Just how high is his power output?<br/>
But the legs soon reattach themselves… As if time itself was rewinding itself, the man returns to his initial state.<br/>
"That was your fault for not dodging!"<br/>
"The hell you say!?"<br/>
In anger, the barrier guy seals the katana guy in his wall.<br/>
Oy, they’re fighting each other.<br/>
Just how uncooperative are these guys?<br/>
… No, I can’t really say anything against them.<br/>
Looking at the past selves of us heroes makes my head hurt.<br/>
Actually, I don’t think Ren and the others would ever get into a fight before an enemy.<br/>
Though, they would call each other names afterwards.<br/>
"Don’t think my absolute barrier can only be used for defense!"<br/>
When the barrier guy clenches his fist tightly, the barrier surrounding the katana guy begins to shrink.<br/>
"Gu… stoop…"<br/>
A cracking sound rings out as the Katana bastard is forced into a box much smaller than his own body.<br/>
Isn’t this overkill?<br/>
There’s a limit to not getting along.<br/>
… Could it be that they were trying to murder one another from the start?<br/>
I mean, Glass did say that some countries of reincarnators were at war, or something.<br/>
"Stop your fighting!"<br/>
Medea calls out to them, but the two aren’t listening.<br/>
Eventually, the barrier breaks, and the Katana Bastard starts attacking the barrier maker.<br/>
There’s no camaraderie here.<br/>
They’re all solo players who claim to be the ace of the team.<br/>
Are those following these reincarnators party members? Women are cheering them on, and some rush forward to join the fray.<br/>
"It looks like they’ll need a capable commander… Ahaha, I found an interesting soul floating around." (Medea)<br/>
Medea starts chuckling… she opens her hand.<br/>
What? The world stopped?<br/>
Only Trash, Medea, and I can still move.<br/>
"Come out." (Medea)<br/>
In the area above Medea’s hand, a black, glass-like ball manifests… the person that emerges from it puts both Trash and I at a loss for words.<br/>
"That’s–"<br/>
Everyone else is the same.<br/>
The deceased Queen stands there, holding up a folding fan to cover her mouth.<br/>
