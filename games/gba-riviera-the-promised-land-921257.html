|                                INTRODUCTION                                 |
|=============================================================================|

This walkthrough exists for one simple reason: Riviera is a game where you
cannot successfully create a handholding walkthrough that covers absolutely
everything. The reason is elementary. There are many, many events, alterations
of events depending on various conditions, and many options that leave the
player with very varied gameplay. If you've played this game, you know the
nature of this game. It's filled with events. 


THE PURPOSE OF THIS WALKTHROUGH IS TO COVER EVERY SINGLE EVENT IN THIS GAME,


and every single effect of every single event and option, including Trust and
Mood modifiers. Something a handholding walkthrough cannot accomplish without
sounding superfluous.

Being a non-handholding walkthrough (yes, it's contradictory), it's going to
seem like a very "cold" and impersonal walkthrough as I'm not guiding you
through anything.

Be forewarned, this walkthrough isn't very newbie friendly. There is more on
that on the "Walkthrough" section of this guide.

|=============================================================================|

   -Version .60 - Initial Release: Chapters 1-4 complete.
   -Version 1.00 - Walkthrough complete. Updates from here on will be
                   corrections and filling in any possible missing events. I,
                   however, won't be doing this myself, as I'm finished.
                   E-mails addressing mistakes and events are appreciated.
                   Thanks for choosing to use this!
   -Version 1.01 - Minor errors corrected. Something doesn't sit right with me
                   changing the version number for minor errors.

                  !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!Big Update!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
   -Version 2.0 - A Trust/Mood Mechanics section has been added. Long story
                  short, I hoped for it to be seperated from this walkthrough
                  and have it stand alone, but various attempts and solutions
                  have failed thus far, so it's tucked away in here. I hope
                  some of you find it useful, a note on where to find it is
                  in the section below.
                  A little something similar happened with my Event Item Guide,
                  but what I planned was successful and now I'm the co-author
                  of the Event Item Guide at GameFAQs. 
                  Because things turned out the way they did, I fixed a couple
                  of notes regarding my other guides sprinkled throughout the
                  walkthrough.

|                            FINDING WHAT YOU WANT                            |
|=============================================================================|

To find what you want, simply use the find function of your browser, usually
CTRL+F.

There are three possible things you may be looking for: A Chapter, an area, and
an event item. All you have to do is input the chapter into your find window.
For example, if you want to look up Chapter 9, simply type in "Chapter 9" in 
your find window, and click find. If you want to look up area 9-9, simply type
up "9-9". You can also type in the name of the area you're in. Press start to
check, if you're not sure. If you want to look up an event item, simply type in
the event item.

As a note, 9-9 and Chapter 9 do not exist. They are examples used to cut down
on the frequency of actual area and chapter titles as not to make finding more
troublesome.

Credits and closing comments, are of course, at the end.

As of version 2.0, information about Trust and Mood has been included. It's at
the end of the walkthrough. To reach it, just CTRL+F "TRUST/MOOD" and tick off
"match case" or a similarly named box with the same function.

How to use the walkthrough
--------------------------
The walkthrough will be laid out in a manner somewhat akin to computer code.
It should be easily understandable when seen.

The walkthrough assumes you already know the basics of the game. It will not
explain anything. It will, however, lay out every event and decision. For a
better feel of what the walkthrough is like, just take a look.

Effects are ordered in the order that they occur.

Minigames
---------
There are four types of minigames. They are named according to the game.
Command, Rhythm, Timing, and Mash.

Disclaimer
----------
It's very troublesome to fully list the don't do parts of the do/don't do type
of options when the don't do option obviously leads to nothing happening. When
those pop up, expect to see something like "Box - Open/Don't Open" followed by
the effect of what happens when it is opened only. 

It is also very troublesome to list the effects of a trigger after its name has
been changed. For example, if looking at the "Rock" trigger gives you an item
and changes its name to "Cracked Rock", then there will not be a listing for
"Cracked Rock" saying it does nothing, if it does nothing. Listing name
changes may also vary, as I don't consider it too important. If there are three
options, this will not apply and the effects will be fully listed.

That is not to say that triggers that do nothing will not be listed. The only
exception is the above. This walkthrough is here to let you know, after all,
of triggers that do nothing. 

Regarding Selecting the "Not Doing" Option
------------------------------------------
As above, I have stated that I will ignore listing the effects of a two choice
do/do not options if the do not does nothing. But in some cases, after
choosing the do not options, you can check the trigger again, and some new
options may appear. I note this because many people have missed such options,
therefore, I encourage playing through again and using this walkthrough to
discover such options, as they're pretty interesting.

Regarding Tier Options
----------------------
These popped up often in Chapter 3. Basically, you're given one set of options,
and no matter what you pick, you're given another set of options. I call these
"tier options".

Regarding Elendia
-----------------
There's a lot of nothing that goes on in Elendia. This means that I'm not going
to go through every area and every NPC. I will only cover any event that
actually occurs. Every description after the first Elendia visit will be very
simplified, that is, after Elendia Pre-Chapter 2 onwards.

Regarding Battle Spoils
-----------------------
I try to attain S-rank to list S-rank items. Sometimes, though, I will list the
A-rank or B-rank items (because I suck).
Spoils also depend on what enemy you kill last. If my spoils are different from
yours, you must've killed a different enemy. I try to specify, though.
You can't expect me to go through S, A, B, and C rank spoils for each enemy for
each battle!
You can easily check what you're going to get, though, by checking the enemies'
status screen and looking at the last thing on the list. So if you killed some-
thing else, and I don't have it listed, you know what to expect anyhow, just
not the number.

Regarding Battle Strategies
---------------------------
All battle strategies give information for S-ranking. Items are received
usually when battles are S-ranked. This is especially true for bosses.

Regarding Missing Events
------------------------
This is just an extra, but I have a favour to ask of you readers.
If you encounter an event that is not in this walkthrough, please inform me!
You will be credited.
This walkthrough's goal and purpose, after all, is to cover every single event
in the game.


----------------------
The actual walkthrough
----------------------

As you choose the Game Start option from the main screen, you'll be treated to
the main intro.

Press A to skip it.

"Asgard, realm of the gods...
 Utgard, land of the demons...

 Ragnarok--the war between the gods
 and the demon invaders--cast the 
 world into a state of violent chaos.

 Overrun by demons, Asgard teetered
 on the brink of destruction.

 In desperation, the gods broke
 the ancient covenant and created
 the black-winged Grim Angels.

 Each armed with a Diviner,
 the angels descended to battle...

 The battle raged on, but through
 their valiant efforts, the angels
 brought an end to the war.

 The demons were sealed away,
 but the gods would soon follow.

 Leaving their power behind in the
 heavenly isle of Riviera, the gods
 entrusted the land's inhabitants to
 watch over it until they return...

 1000 years passed quietly...

 Signs of the demons' return were
 rumored throughout Riviera.

 The Seven Magi, proxies of the gods,
 made a difficult decision for the sake
 of Asgard's continued existance...

 ...To activate the divine power
 of destruction, "The Retribution."

 The Magi appointed this task
 to beings well-suited for the job...

 Now, two angels shall descend
 to the sacred soil of Riviera."

The Accursed!
-------------
The Demon Knight (Isher) - 8000pts.
If you've bothered to level up Serene, Serene's Ignis Spear does a hefty 400
damage. Make sure it hits! Her bats also do around 120. Bring in whatever
elementals you can, and avoid bringing anything without an element. If you
still hold one of the stronger elemental swords, Serene can dish out some heavy
damage with them, a lot more than the bats. Isher is a heavy guarder, don't
count on all your hits connecting. Disaresta will definitely not fully connect.
Each of Disaresta's normal hits do about 60-70, while the final does 150.
As you can see, Serene is key here if you have the right items, so hopefully
you did bother to pump her up, especially with her scythe.

Accident!
Summer, winter, spring, and fall...
N: White Snow {Winter}
S: Bright Sun {Summer}
E: Blooming Flowers {Spring}
W: Vivid Leaves {Fall}

Quick Explanation: You must follow the seasons as the sign originally listed.
                   Summer is first, so you head south. In the next area,
                   the directions are now different. You must check the sign
                   to see where winter is, and head in the winter direction.
                   After you complete the first portion, you must head in
                   normal season order: Spring, summer, fall, winter. If you
                   mess up, you start all over from the beginning.

Solution: Start at spring (Purple Screen). Head South, East, North, West.
          Then head West, South, North, South, and any direction last.

Items: Acquire Event Item Aran Doll by following a backwards season order.
       Start at spring, then head North, South, North, South (Winter, Fall,
       Summer, Spring) to make the chest appear.

If you've kept everyone up to pace, you'll get roughly the numbers I've got.
Lina's Arbalest does 550. Fia's katana, the Zantetsu, does 775 if all four hits
connect. Fia's Presto does 650. Serene's Mr. Bat III's Vampire Night does a
hefty 1500 damage. Have Ein use a one-hit weapon like Burning Sun, he's pretty
much useless for this battle. Rely on these for a quick-paced battle and you'll
be finished in no time. Have anyone else use Mr. Bat III at your own 
discretion.
S-rank Spoils: Saint Sceptre

A large lake of

The clarity makes it
appear shallwow, but
it's actually quite deep.

============================
Underground Lake Explanation
============================
This is a rather complicated part of the game, so pay attention. Remember those
inscriptions? When you reach the shrines, it'll tell you to place an Ankh of a
certain priest. Logically working out those inscriptions, you'll eventually
come to L, T, and A, and the water will be drained so you can reach 5-8. 

But forget about that, here's how it REALLY works. Thanks to Terence.

First, note that the lake is a 3x3 grid. The ankhs each correspond to a letter
over that 3x3 grid in the following way:

_X_   _X_   X__   XXX   X_X   X_X
X_X   _X_   X__   _X_   _X_   _X_
X_X   _X_   XXX   _X_   X_X   _X_

Each of these areas in the grid have two water levels. Placing an Ankh in a
shrine reduces the water level in the respective represented areas by one.
For example, the I Ankh will reduce the water levels in [5], [6], and [7]
allowing you to tread through.

However, when Ankhs overlap, the water level is reduced by TWO. This means that
the lower ground will have no water, free for you to check for secrets.

The quickest way to get everything is to place L in Red, T in Yellow, and X in
Blue. This will allow you to get the secrets in [8] and [6], as well as
keeping open all the secrets in the western part of the lake. Finally, replace
the X with A to unlock the path to the east and get the final secret in SE.

That's it. If you understand, continue with the walkthrough. If you're having
trouble, ask on the GameFAQs forums and point out what's confusing you.

This portion of the walkthrough, of course, will cover and note which triggers
require how many levels of water drained.

I suggest heading straight to the shrines and dealing with triggers on your
way, then backtrack, as opposed to instantly visiting areas just to backtrack
when you've drained the second level of water.

In short: L Ankh first shrine, T Ankh second shrine, X Ankh third shrine, head
          to [8], then back to [6]~[1], go back to third shrine and replace
          with A and continue.

The Accursed!
-------------
The Grim Reaper - 8000pts.
At this point in the game, it's tough to give strategies and numbers as there
are many, many possibilities. Death here is weak against Physical, Fire, and
Holy especially, so that means you can bring everyone's level 3 weapon for this
stage, more specifically, Iria's Bow, Black Scythe, Salamander Rod, Mithril
Sword, and Holy Sabre. That's a lot of freedom. Bring whoever and whatever you
want, just make sure you can dispatch those elementals quickly.
If you're not picky about items, feel free to bring in a Cheer Bell or Flag,
the two most useful support items, although you won't need it if you have...
I, luckily, still had Mr. Bat III, and it still does 1500 damage and heals
everyone, which is very helpful. Fia's new katana, the Kiku-Ichimonji, shaves
off a clean 1000. With these huge numbers, you'll finish in no time.
You can bring in the Saint Sceptre to do a perfect 999 once, if you're willing 
to waste one space just for that.
Once Death shifts modes, he's strong against every element save for Holy.
Physical damage is still effective. If you were using Cierra, it'll hamper you.
Otherwise, it isn't much of a big deal. Disaresta wouldn't be as strong as you
might expect it, though, about 1250 damage for me, but that should be more than
enough.

             have a left side and right side. For example, while it is true you
             can reach [7]'s right side from [9]'s left side, you cannot go to
             [7]'s left side from [9], and thus, cannot head to area 6-9 from
             [9].

Also, I'll write down the event that occurs when jumping from one platform to
the next here to cut down on repetition.

vs. Grim Angel
--------------
The Solitary Angel - 10000pts.
Ledah's weakness is Ice, so bring in your Silver Moon. You can bring in Silvia
and Blue Stinger, but you'll mostly be sticking to using Cierra and Serene.
Bring in whatever else you want. This battle shouldn't be too difficult. Fia's
katanas are still useful, but Cierra using the Blue Stinger does some HEAVY
damage, what with it being a magic attack and her magic being high.
Serene at 130 STR knocks off 1350 with her Almighty. Cierra at 141 MGC knocks
off 870 with just a normal Blue Stinger attack, but it's not going it hit all
the time. If you're unwilling to bring in Cierra because of her low speed, try
changing the formation to Magic. It knocks off 10WT after every magic attack.
Her Freezing Matter overdrive does 1200, an amazing number for a level 1
overdrive. Use it if you don't mind delaying Serene Almighty.
Ein is pretty useless. Have him use the Cheer Bell or other support items,
otherwise, just have him shave off some wimpy 200 every turn, or build up
the overdrive meter with the Blue Stinger.
Ledah changes form once, and his ice weakness halves. Meaning your attacks will
halve. Serene Almighty manages less than half of what it did originally
under this condition, 620, so calculate carefully if you're finishing with her
overdrive.
If you plan well, you can quickly finish this using Cierra's Freezing Matter
thrice, and finishing with Serene Almighty. If you for some reason leveled up
the next chapter's scythe this chapter, you can finish it in two Freezing
Matters and one Serene Absolute, as long as you make Ein attack once with the
Blue Stinger after the second Freezing Matter so the overdrive bar can reach 3.

The Devilish Angel - 12000pts.
I had a serious lack of fire items, so this won't be so thorough. If you took
Southern Cross in the previous battle and had no problem leveling that up,
bring it. As usual, Fia's katana's are useful, doing their usual amount. In any
case, do what you can with the Phoenix Wand and any other fire weapons you
might have. Southern Cross's overdrive will hurt A LOT. Phoenix Wand's
Prominence did 2500.
By the time you've built up the overdrive bar and it's Cierra's turn Malice 
probably has a hunk of her HP taken off, and using Prominence would bring her
down to near-death. This is so because Cierra gets frozen easily. This means
that you probably won't be able to finish her off using Prominence again. No
fear, though, you don't need a level 3 to get an S-rank, just a level 2. In
the case of Cierra being handicapped, just blast away with Fia's Phoenix Wand's
Carmine Cutlass, for a good 1250 damage if all hits connect.

Warps are one-way only, meaning you can't head back to where you came from
using the same warp you just popped out of.

You'll miss out on Serene's conversation, though. It's not a big deal, but
just save before [C3] and run around a bit if you want to read it, along with
other less important conversations.


Dark Progenitors
================

At the first five warp points you go to, regardless of which you choose, you'll
encounter a Dark Progenitor. I will not be listing them below in the actual
rooms for obvious reasons; instead, they'll be listed here, in order.

By the way, Serene's bats are ALWAYS useful. It'd be amazing if you still had
them, but they're not necessary.

Dark Progenitor!
----------------
Dark Progenitor I - 5000pts.
Bring in your strongest everything, as it's not weak against anything except...
If you took a Tri-Shot by killing one of the earlier Diana's Vassals, it'll do
a good 720 with Lina at 107 Str.
S-rank Spoils: Leyte Claw x30

Dark Progenitor!
----------------
Dark Progenitor II - 5000pts.
Physical won't have much of an effect, so once again, bring in your strongest.
Fallen Fan is particularly effective, doing a good 1200 at 159 Mgc, but it's
prone to being guarded, so you'll most likely pull of 800 with it. Finishing
off with Disaresta isn't a bad ideal, but it's very prone to being guarded as
well, so plan well.
S-rank Spoils: Gran Sabre x30

Dark Progenitor!
----------------
Dark Progenitor III - 5000pts.
Finally, a clear weakness. Thunder and fire. Leyte Claw and Diana's Bow with
Lina and Serene is a good idea, unless you want to use Cierra, then go right
ahead. Tri-Shot does a nice 625 at 107 Str, but Serene's Leyte Claw does 650,
if it all connects. Either way, they're useful. Stardust does 4100, that is,
if all the shots connect. This guy has 4500 HP. You'll have no problems. 
In fact, you should just focus on building up the Overdrive bar. Ein using 
the flag should be pretty useful in that case, it'll let you finish in no 
time at all.
S-rank Spoils: Heilkraut x25


Dark Progenitor!
----------------
Dark Progenitor IV - 5000pts.
Physical, this time. Gran Sabre is good, and once again, Tri-Shot, which is the
most effective in this battle, doing a good 925 at 107 Str. Fia's Katana's if
you still have them. With these, you'll finish quickly. Divine Ascension did
2825 at 128 Str for me.
S-rank Spoils: Souther Cross x30

Dark Progenitor!
----------------
Dark Progenitor V - 5000pts.
Rosier and Einherjar, that's all you'll need. Cadenza wipes off 2400. Terre
Promize 1800, and Judgment 900.
S-rank Spoils: Infinite Arc x30

vs. Hector
----------
The Traitorous Magus - 10000pts.
Stats: Ein - Str 128, Serene - Str 142, Lina - Str 107
Leyte Claw and Diana's Bow with Serene and Lina. The rest should be straight-
forward. Although beward, he can change properties, so bring in the Infinite
Arc just in case. Don't have Lina use the Leyte Claw, it does about the same
damage as the bow but it's prone to missing. Serene's No Mercy knocks off 1700
if all hits connect. Ein's Glint Arrow does 825. Stardust does a heavy 2800
when all hits connect. If you're fast enough, chances are he won't change
elements at all, but by the time he does, he'll probably have really low HP.

vs. Seth-Rah
------------
The Holy Demon - 12000pts.
It's the final battle. I've no idea which girl you can't use, and I'm not going
to give strategies for each girl. The Rosier is _the_ weapon to use before
Seth-Rah's metamorphisis. Fia is especially useful here because of that, but if
you don't have her, use Serene and Cierra. After the metamorphisis, use your
preferred girl's overskill; Stardust, Serene Absolute, or Calamity Flare.
If you leveled up, you won't have much trouble at all. If you didn't, well,
good luck and bring some healing items. If Seth-Rah hasn't metamorphed, with
Ein at 128 Str, finish off using Disaresta: 4450 damage.
You can be cheap and use Fanelia and Longinus if you have those, but that's no
fun! I finished in 60 counts using Fanelia. You can probably finish in less if
you had both.

|=============================================================================|
|                                 TRUST/MOOD                                  |
|=============================================================================|

Trust and Mood in this game is what can explained as the values that show
how much the girls like you. The only thing it truly affects, as far as anybody
knows, is the ending. Trust and Mood have many rules to them, and they can't
really be categorized, so the best I can do is state the facts in a succinct
and orderly format.

Big thanks goes to Terence.

- Ties are handled like so, with the first having priority:
  Cierra, Serene, Lina, Fia.
- Mood has a minimum of -5 and a maximum of 10.
- Mood increases by 2 if the girl deals the final blow in a non-practice
- Mood decreases by 1 if the girl falls in battle.
- Mood increases by 1 whenever trust is gained, no matter how small.
- Mood decreases by 1 whenever trust is lost, no matter how small.
- Mood is reset to 0 after each chapter.
- Mood is set in proportion to trust before a chapter. The girl with the
  highest trust gets 3, the second highest gets 2, third gets 1, and last 0.
- Mood determines who the "friend" is for the chapter. The one with the higest
  has her portrait shown. If all are 0 or below, Ein's portrait is shown.
- Trust cannot go below 0 and has no known maximum.
- Trust increases by 2 if the girl is pleased (6 or more mood) at the end of a 
  chapter, and decreases by 1 if the girl is in a bad mood (0 or less mood).
- Trust is mostly changed during the many events of the game.
- Trust is never reset, only altered.

----------------
Icon Explanation
----------------

In the status window, a girl will always have a bubble with an icon in it.
The icon is a rough measurement of mood and trust. The only thing it can tell
you is who has the most trust, and how much mood the girl has for the chapter.

The icons are as follows:

             First Tier      Second Tier
Bad Mood:    Ellipses (...)  Sweatdrop
Normal Mood: Blank           Star
Good Mood:   Note            Heart

Bad Mood is 0 or less Mood.
Normal Mood is 0-5 Mood.
Good Mood is 6-10 Mood.

The first tier icon is the standard one. The second tier icon indicates which
girl has the most trust. Thus, only one second tier icon can ever exist at
any moment. One character cannot have a sweatdrop while another has a heart.

Note that if a girl is in a Bad Mood, they count as having a modifier of -2 
Trust with regards to who gets the second icon. And if they're in a Good Mood, 
they count as having a modifier of +2 Trust with regards to the second icon. 

For example, if you Cierra had a Trust of 17 and was in a Good Mood, while 
Serene had a Trust of 21 and was in a Bad Mood (and the others had low enough 
Trust to not count at all in this example), then Cierra would have the Heart 
symbol and Serene would have the ... symbol.

----------------
Regarding Ending
----------------

A girl will be captured no matter what. Everything is determined at 7-4, the
girl with the second tier icon will be captured. Even if the possesor of the
second tier icon changes, the girl with the second tier icon from 7-4 will
still be captured. 

Ending requirements can be summed up as follows:

Cierra's Ending: Cierra has second tier icon at the start of 7-4, and Cierra's
Trust is 40 or more.
Serene's Ending: Serene has second tier icon at the start of 7-4, and Serene's
Trust is 40 or more.
Lina's Ending: Lina has second tier icon at the start of 7-4, and Lina's Trust
is 40 or more.
Fia's Ending: Fia has second tier icon at the start of 7-4, and Fia's Trust is
40 or more.
Rose's Normal Ending: Serene, Lina or Fia had second tier icon at the start of
7-4, but whichever girl was captured had 39 Trust or less.
Rose's True Ending: Cierra had second tier icon at the start of 7-4, and 
Cierra's Trust was 39 or less.

As a note, if mood takes a severe decline after 7-4, the trust modifier comes
into play and the ending may change, despite who had the second tier icon at
7-4.

Starting Trust Values:
Cierra: 19
Serene: 17
Lina: 4
Fia: 13

So hopefully, you understand everything now.
