Level Reset <br/>
 <br/>
 <br/>
I lie down on the bed in the guest room and rest my body. <br/>
Ah, indeed it's heavy. When I lie down, I can really feel it. The effects of the curse are strong and quite severe. <br/>
The sun has set already, what can I do. <br/>
By the way, Firo is with Melty. Their relationship is quite close. <br/>
 <br/>
“Thank you for your hard work” (rishia) <br/>
 <br/>
Rishia voices these words of gratitude. <br/>
 <br/>
“Come to think of it, you're not wearing the costume” (naofumi) <br/>
“Ah, Yes. I thought we weren't going to fight for a short while so I took it off, but is that displeasing?” (rishia) <br/>
“No, it's just become habitual, I wasn't telling you to wear it” (naofumi) <br/>
“Rishia-san is, how do I say it.... it seems like you enjoy wearing the costume” (raphtalia) <br/>
“Yes. When I wear that costume my body becomes lighter.” (rishia) <br/>
 <br/>
That's because there are various enchantments on it. It's quite convenient. <br/>
 <br/>
“It was amazing, Naofumi-san” (rishia) <br/>
“Ah, at last you call me by my name” (naofumi) <br/>
“Eh, ah....” (rishia) <br/>
“Don't worry about it. I'm not particularly angry.” (naofumi) <br/>
 <br/>
Perhaps Rishia gained some courage after prevailing in a big battle. <br/>
This is a joyous thing. <br/>
 <br/>
“There's territory. There's also court ranking.....this is quite a big promotion” (raphtalia) <br/>
“I was originally a hero..... it doesn't really excite me though” (naofumi) <br/>
“Naofumi-sama, what is your desire?” (raphtalia) <br/>
 <br/>
Raphtalia asks me with distrust in her eyes. <br/>
Speaking of which, she started to speak out when I specified the territory I wanted to the queen. <br/>
 <br/>
“Is this about today? It's just as I said. It's unfortunate but the allied troops just aren't reliable. Judging from the tough battle from before, if we don't make a private army of troops, it'll be quite relentless from here on.” (naofumi) <br/>
“But still, why the damaged area from the first wave?” (raphtalia) <br/>
“That's also in accordance with what I said during the day, we'll be doing a variety of thing so please be prepared.” (naofumi) <br/>
“Hah.....good grief, it seems as though we won't have any peace if we're together with Naofumi-sama” (raphtalia) <br/>
“This is all just until we finish overcoming the waves. Please bear with it” (naofumi) <br/>
“I understand” (raphtalia) <br/>
“Fufu, you look just like an old married couple” (rishia) <br/>
 <br/>
Rishia dropped a bombshell-like announcement. <br/>
Well, Raphtalia is the one who I’ve known the longest in this world, I kind of understand. <br/>
We're not a couple though. <br/>
 <br/>
“Wha-wha-what are you saying!?” (raphtalia) <br/>
 <br/>
Raphtalia yells, her face colouring in embarrassment. <br/>
Ah, indeed, Rishia has stepped on a land mine and brought on imperial wrath by mentioning that love affair. <br/>
 <br/>
Originally she was just an ordinary slave, but Raphtalia is a more kind-hearted and meddling person than others. <br/>
She lost her family, her home was snatched away; I can easily imagine her grief. <br/>
In other words, Raphtalia is fighting so there won't be more people in the same situation as her. <br/>
With such a noble purpose, Raphtalia wouldn't be thinking of love affairs. <br/>
 <br/>
To begin with, Raphtalia's outer appearance may be that of an adult however, in terms of age, she is still a kid. <br/>
She's not old enough to be falling in love. <br/>
 <br/>
Well, Rishia is in love with Itsuki so those kind of feelings are, for better or worse, a woman's. <br/>
Which reminds me, how old is Rishia? Her appearance gives the impression of a middle school student.....so around 14 years old. <br/>
It seems a bit premature but it is another world. <br/>
 <br/>
“That's right, Rishia. Raphtalia doesn't like those kind of jokes. Be careful” (naofumi) <br/>
“Na-Naofumi-sama......” (raphtalia) <br/>
 <br/>
A blushing Raphtalia regained her composure. <br/>
There there, provoking others isn't good. <br/>
 <br/>
“O-Okay....?” (rishia) <br/>
 <br/>
Rishia tilted her head in confusion whist staring at Raphtalia and I. <br/>
 <br/>
“Well then, we'll be engaged in a variety of things tomorrow. Rishia, what are you going to do?” (naofumi) <br/>
“What do you mean by 'what am I going to do'?” (rishia) <br/>
“I'm referring to resetting your level. Since the wave has been pushed back considerably, if you want to re-level up, now is a good time” (naofumi) <br/>
“Eh, ah!? Tha-that's right isn't it.....umm” (rishia) <br/>
“The one to decide is Rishia. Consider your actions properly. Seeing as this is a good opportunity” (naofumi) <br/>
“Okay. I will think about it for a bit” (rishia) <br/>
 <br/>
Thus, we rested thoroughly and prepared for tomorrow. <br/>
 <br/>
 <br/>
“Now then” (naofumi) <br/>
 <br/>
After eating breakfast at the castle, we have a quick chat with the queen. <br/>
Since the timing was just right, I ask Rishia. <br/>
 <br/>
“Have you come up with an outcome?” (naofumi) <br/>
“Ah, yes...... I also want to become as strong as Raphtalia-san! Therefore I have decided to start over” (rishia) <br/>
“Is that so, well then....” (naofumi) <br/>
 <br/>
When I turn to face the queen, the queen also nodded. <br/>
 <br/>
“Then I will give instructions to perform the service by means of the Hourglass of the Dragon's Era” (queen) <br/>
“That'd be a great help. Today we'll be occupied with a lot of things” (naofumi) <br/>
 <br/>
We leave the castle and travel to the Hourglass of the Dragon's Era. <br/>
Ah, we should put on a robe to obscure our face. If we don't do this, guys will be following after us in groups, even the queen <br/>
 <br/>
“I heard the story from the queen” (soldier) <br/>
 <br/>
A soldier guides us to the Hourglass of the Dragon's Era. <br/>
......As I thought, the hourglass has stopped. <br/>
For some reason, the sand has solidified and doesn't fall. <br/>
 <br/>
“Originally this is only used as a punishment for criminals though” (soldier) <br/>
“Just a bit” (naofumi) <br/>
“I heard the rumours. The Hero of the Shield's comrades possess strength rivalling that of the heroes', so what's the secret to that strength?” (soldier) <br/>
 <br/>
What a nosy soldier. <br/>
It would be a burden to get involved in something strange. I limit my answer to something ambiguous. <br/>
 <br/>
“No, it's just simple harassment. This kid is a subordinate of someone I hate, you see, I thought I'd reset her level and send her back to him” (naofumi) <br/>
“Fueeeeeeeeeee!?” (rishia) <br/>
 <br/>
Rishia lets out a dreadful cry. <br/>
 <br/>
“I-is that how it is!?” (rishia) <br/>
 <br/>
Read the atmosphere. <br/>
Raphtalia looks at me with a shocked face <br/>
Where is Firo looking? She's gazing into the horizon. <br/>
Sigh....I bring my face close to Rishia's ear and whisper. <br/>
 <br/>
“The harassment thing is a lie. If I tell the truth to that kind of fellow, mercenaries and adventurers will swarm us, wanting to be strong. Your Itsuki also had a habit of concealing, right?” (naofumi) <br/>
“Ye-yes” (rishia) <br/>
 <br/>
Jeez, I'd like you to sense these things. <br/>
What adventurers, in the end it'd just be a gathering of ruffians. <br/>
After they acquire a certain amount of power, guys who are really eager should enlist to become soldiers in a country somewhere. <br/>
 <br/>
Even if they reach the level cap prior to a class up, guys who become adventurers either don't want to enter a guild or are wannabe criminals. <br/>
What I want to make is a private army who will listen to my instructions, not guys who are just strong. <br/>
After the weak become strong, complaints will be raised. At any rate, I would have to deal with those kind of guys in the distant future. <br/>
 <br/>
“And, how do I reset the level?” (naofumi) <br/>
“Firstly, put on this choker and stand on the magic circle in front of the Hourglass of the Dragon's Era” (soldier) <br/>
 <br/>
I give Rishia the choker that the soldier was holding out. <br/>
Rishia put on the choker and stands on the magic circle just like the instructions. <br/>
Perhaps some sort of power of resistance will be removed by wearing the choker. <br/>
 <br/>
“Is this really alright​​?” (naofumi) <br/>
“Yes!” (rishia) <br/>
 <br/>
Rishia's decision was firm. <br/>
Hm? There are people to help with the service, just like during the class up, but they had prepared a stretcher. <br/>
 <br/>
“There is a reaction from the resetting. A few days of rehabilitation will be necessary, I think” (soldier) <br/>
 <br/>
I see..... <br/>
That's right, if the stats that were natural until suddenly drop, the body will become heavy.... <br/>
Since I'm already like this, I think that if someone returned to level 1, then they would become unable to move for sure <br/>
 <br/>
“There are individual differences though” (soldier) <br/>
 <br/>
While saying that, the soldier starts the ritual. <br/>
The Hourglass of the Dragon's Era shines, filling the magic circle with power. <br/>
It's similar to the scene from the Class Up. <br/>
 <br/>
“Right now in this place, there is someone here to release their power for the sake of choosing a new path. Oh, world. Show this person the path and give them a chance.” (soldier) <br/>
“u....ku....” (rishia) <br/>
 <br/>
Rishia moans in the centre of the magic circle. <br/>
 <br/>
“A feeling of p-power escaping is...” (rishia) <br/>
 <br/>
As I thought, it's that kind of feeling. <br/>
Before long, something suddenly emerges from Rishia and I affirm it scattering in all four directions. <br/>
 <br/>
“It's over. How's your body's condition?” (naofumi) <br/>
“Eh​?” (rishia) <br/>
 <br/>
Rishia repeatedly opens and closes her hands. <br/>
 <br/>
“It doesn't feel very different” (rishia) <br/>
“Was it a failure?” (naofumi) <br/>
“That shouldn't be the case?” (soldier) <br/>
 <br/>
I slowly check Rishia's status. <br/>
Right. <br/>
It's returned to level 1. <br/>
 <br/>
It's just that.... there’s almost no change in stats. <br/>
The bit that rises from levelling up is almost non-existent, so there’s no sense of discomfort even when returning to level 1. <br/>
 <br/>
..... If this was reversed, it would be considerably harsh. <br/>
If she has no disposition for battle, then what should I do. <br/>
I can't just depend on the shield's growth correction. <br/>
 <br/>
“By the way, should Raphtalia and Firo do it too?” (naofumi) <br/>
“No.....I am....” (raphtalia) <br/>
“Firo doesn't want to do it either” (firo) <br/>
 <br/>
Well, these two don't really need to. <br/>
Growth Correction started when Raphtalia was level 25 so its not like it would be meaningless. <br/>
Firo also has the Philorial Series Growth Correction to depend on so there shouldn't be any loss. <br/>
 <br/>
Well, if we don't proceed gradually, offensive power won't be enough and we'll become unable to fight. <br/>
Moreover.... it seems that the moment Firo resets her level, she'll become a baby chick. <br/>
I don’t know what kind of growth Philorials have though. <br/>
Fixing her upbringing is good but since the one in question doesn't want to do it, there's no need. <br/>
 <br/>
“Is that so, then let's head to the next place” (naofumi) <br/>
“We're ready whenever” (soldier) <br/>
 <br/>
The soldier in charge bows his head. <br/>
The interaction is considerably different from before. <br/>
I'm aware that I’m staring back and inspecting him. <br/>
He's a bit childish but.....my evaluation of him rose a little.
