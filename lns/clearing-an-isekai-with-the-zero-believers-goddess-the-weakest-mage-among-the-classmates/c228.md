<br/><br/>
n◇Hero Abel POV◇n<br/>
n“I will go to the Demon Lord Castle to save Momo.” (Makoto)n<br/>
nThat person said straight.n<br/>
nIn such a lighthearted manner as if he were saying he was going to have a short walk. n<br/>
n“Impossible! Going there alone is suicidal!” (Volkh)n<br/>
n“That’s right! We will go too!” (Julietta)n<br/>
n“You people would die. My mission would fail.” (Makoto)n<br/>
n““?!””n<br/>
nThe words he said coldly made Vokh-san and Julietta-san fall silent.n<br/>
n(Ugh…!) n<br/>
nThe man, who introduced himself as Makoto and said that he received an oracle from the Sun Goddess-sama, was looking straightn at men.n<br/>
nWhy is he looking at me…?n<br/>
nMe, a useless Hero…n<br/>
n—The Demon Lord Bifrons subjugation plan a few days ago.n<br/>
nThe strongest team with the Fire Hero as the leader.n<br/>
nWe were confident that this time for sure we would succeed in subjugating a Demon Lord.n<br/>
nBut…n<br/>
nBefore we reached the Demon Lord Castle, the assault of the Demon Lord Cain and Setekh of the Demonic Eye crushed us.n<br/>
nMore than half of the Hero alliance team was killed by Cain, and the remaining were petrified and captured by Setekh. n<br/>
nAt that time, the captain of the team and my master, the Fire Hero, died.n<br/>
nI couldn’t do anything.n<br/>
nI was recognized as a Hero with promise, but the confidence I had gained after defeating many demons and monsters had been crushed to pieces.n<br/>
nTo think a Demon Lord would be…that fearsome…and how unreasonable of an existence they are…n<br/>
nIt is impossible…n<br/>
nEven the Fire Hero that guided us was no match at all against Demon Lord Cain.n<br/>
nThere’s no way we can win…n<br/>
nMy heart broke, and even when help came, my emotions sunk like mud.n<br/>
nIt seems like Volkh-san and Julietta-san haven’t given up, but I have already lost the energy to challenge the Demon Lord anymore.n<br/>
nThat’s why even when attacked by the monsters that chased after us, I thought ‘whatever happens happens’.n<br/>
nBut the result of that was…the little girl being kidnapped.n<br/>
nIt was my fault…n<br/>
nAt that moment, he prioritized saving me instead of Momo.n<br/>
nI don’t know why though…n<br/>
n“Then, I will go back. The 3 of you, please wait at Laberintos.” (Makoto)n<br/>
nHe said this and was about to head through the path we came from.n<br/>
nAll alone.n<br/>
nIs that okay?n<br/>
nIs it really okay to have him go alone?n<br/>
n“Please wait! I will…I will go too!” (Abel)n<br/>
nThose words unconsciously came out from me.n<br/>
n◇◇n<br/>
n“Uhm…are you angry, Makoto-san?” (Abel)n<br/>
nI nervously ask…Makoto-san.n<br/>
nWe are currently heading back to the Demon Lord Castle.n<br/>
nWhen I said I would go with him, the indifferent expression of Makoto-san warped for the first time.n<br/>
nHe had a clear ndispleasedn expression.n<br/>
nT-There’s no need to make such a face…n<br/>
n“I am happy for the offer, but I will go alone—” (Makoto)n<br/>
nMakoto-san refused without missing a beat.n<br/>
n“Wait wait, Makoto-kun! Volkh-san and I are vanguards, so we need our weapons and armor to get our full strength, but Abel is good at healing and support magic. I am sure he will be of use!” (Julietta)n<br/>
nJulietta-san followed up for me.n<br/>
nVolkh-san pushed the idea that all four of us should be going.n<br/>
nWe argued for a while, but Makoto-san said ‘I want to chase after Momo fast’ and both Volkh-san and Julietta-san stepped back.n<br/>
nI didn’t fight much against the monsters before so I wasn’t that exhausted, and with the fact that I can use healing magic, it ended with me following Makoto-san as his support.n<br/>
nWe went past the forest and the top of the Demon Lord Castle was now in view.n<br/>
nThe night had passed and the view was clearer.n<br/>
n“Uhm, Makoto-san…” (Abel)n<br/>
n“…What?” (Makoto)n<br/>
n“No…” (Abel)n<br/>
nMakoto-san has been silent this whole time.n<br/>
nHe really is angry…I think?n<br/>
nAt that moment, a giant shadow passed by above.n<br/>
n“Stop.” (Makoto)n<br/>
n“Y-Yes!” (Abel)n<br/>
nMakoto-san and I hide in the shadow of a tree nearby.n<br/>
nThe identity of the shadows in the sky were a pack of dragons.n<br/>
nSeveral tens of wyverns and a red dragon flapping its wings majestically.n<br/>
nThat’s…n<br/>
n“The red dragon of Demon Lord Bifrons…” (Abel)n<br/>
n“The Demon Lord has returned, huh.” (Makoto)n<br/>
nMy trembling voice was overwritten by the indifferent voice of Makoto-san.n<br/>
nThis person doesn’t feel fear?n<br/>
nThe pack of dragons grew smaller as they disappeared at the direction of the Demon Lord Castle.n<br/>
n“Let’s go.” (Makoto)n<br/>
nMakoto-san slowly began to walk forward.n<br/>
n“W-Wait please! The Demon Lord has returned. It is impossible. Saving her is already…” (Abel)n<br/>
n“Abel-san.” (Makoto)n<br/>
nMakoto-san turned around.n<br/>
nHis eyes were clear.n<br/>
nNo tension, anger, fear, not even a heart of justice; eyes that I couldn’t feel a single emotion from.n<br/>
n“You really should go back to Volkh-san and Julietta-san.” (Makoto)n<br/>
n“?!” n<br/>
nDid he think I got cold feet there?n<br/>
nBut everyone is scared of Demon Lords no matter who they are! n<br/>
nMakoto-san continued walking to the Demon Lord Castle without saying a word.n<br/>
nI must go too.n<br/>
nHe didn’t even look back.n<br/>
n(Does he not mind whether I am there or not…?) n<br/>
n“If you are coming with me, don’t get too far away from me.” (Makoto)n<br/>
n“?! …Yes!” (Abel)n<br/>
nEven though he is not looking here.n<br/>
nWhat a mysterious person.n<br/>
nEven though he shows no emotions and has a cold voice, I could tell that he was worrying about me.n<br/>
nDifferent from my master and Volkh-san, his back is by no means big.n<br/>
nAnd yet, for some reason, I felt safe looking at that back.n<br/>
nI chased after the back of Makoto-san.n<br/>
n◇◇n<br/>
n“Let’s rest in shifts till night.” (Makoto)n<br/>
n“O-Okay…” (Abel)n<br/>
nA space of shrubs in a thicket that was dense enough for 2 people to lie down close to the Demon Lord Castle.n<br/>
nI thought for sure that we would jump into the Demon Lord Castle immediately, but Makoto-san said we would be waiting for night to come.n<br/>
n“Sleep first please.” (Makoto)n<br/>
n“N-No, you are tired too, right, Makoto-san? I will stay up as a lookout.” (Abel)n<br/>
n“…Is that so. Please tell me when 1 hour passes.” (Makoto)n<br/>
nSaying this, I heard his rhythmic breathing a few seconds after.n<br/>
nHe must have been quite tired.n<br/>
nIt is past noon now.n<br/>
nIt certainly is way too bad of a time to infiltrate.n<br/>
nI watched the Demon Lord Castle spaced out, and suddenly something passed in front of me.n<br/>
n(Eh?!) n<br/>
nIt was a blue butterfly.n<br/>
nIt had glossy transparent-like wings and was flying around Makoto-san.n<br/>
n“Is this…a living being made from water magic?” (Abel)n<br/>
nI could feel slight mana from it.n<br/>
nBut…who?n<br/>
nMakoto-san should be asleep.n<br/>
nAnd then, I noticed…n<br/>
nMakoto-san is using magic nwhile sleepingn.n<br/>
nChills ran down my back.n<br/>
nWasn’t he supposed to be resting? n<br/>
nNo, he is unconsciously doing it.n<br/>
nHe is always training even while sleeping.n<br/>
n“You…just who in the world are you?” (Abel)n<br/>
nHe easily saved us who were captured at the Demon Lord Castle, and was trying to return all on his own to save the little girl that was captured by the Demon Lord.n<br/>
nHe said that it was an oracle from the Sun Goddess Althena-sama.n<br/>
nBut Althena-sama doesn’t say anything to me.n<br/>
nEven though the Lightning Hero Skill was something that Althena-sama granted me…n<br/>
nWhen we were on our way, I asked ‘what Hero Skill do you have?’ to Makoto-san.n<br/>
nThen, he gave the bizarre answer of ‘I don’t have any Hero Skill. I only have 3 elementary ranked Skills’.n<br/>
nThat’s impossible.n<br/>
nNo way.n<br/>
nI have the [Appraisal: Saint Rank] Skill.n<br/>
nI stealthily confirmed the Skills of Makoto-san…and it was true.n<br/>
n[Water Magic], [Sun Magic], [Destiny Magic] all elementary rank Skills, and also [Spirit User].n<br/>
nThose were all of his Battle Skills.n<br/>
nThere’s also [Clear Mind] and…just what in the world is [RPG Player]?n<br/>
nIt was also shocking that his physical ability is terribly low.n<br/>
nAlso, most of all…n<br/>
n(He is not a believer of Althena-sama?!) n<br/>
nEven though he is not a believer, he received an oracle…?! n<br/>
nMy head couldn’t keep up.n<br/>
nWhat’s with this person?n<br/>
nI look at his profile face that was peacefully sleeping despite being close to the Demon Lord Castle.n<br/>
nJust what kind of nerves is he made of…?n<br/>
nI gave up on understanding him.n<br/>
n◇Takatsuki Makoto POV◇n<br/>
n“Then, let’s go.” (Makoto)n<br/>
n“It is still evening though… Is it okay?” (Abel)n<br/>
nHero Abel asked worriedly.n<br/>
nIt is true that it would be better if we were to infiltrate late in the night just like yesterday.n<br/>
nBut…n<br/>
n“I am worried about Momo.” (Makoto)n<br/>
n“…Yeah.” (Abel)n<br/>
nThere were no objections to my words.n<br/>
n“You can wait here if you want, Abel-san.” (Makoto)n<br/>
n“D-Don’t give me that after coming all the way here! I will go too.” (Abel)n<br/>
n“Got it.” (Makoto)n<br/>
nIt would trouble me if Hero Abel were to die, so I am fine with him just staying back though…n<br/>
nEven so, I managed to sleep well for the first time in a while after coming to the past.n<br/>
nWhen I first arrived here, I couldn’t relax until I could confirm the safety of Hero Abel. I didn’t sleep for more than 24 hours till before saving them.n<br/>
n…Lacking sleep is not good.n<br/>
nI ended up messing up and had Momo kidnapped.n<br/>
n{Spirit-sans, are you there?} (Makoto)n<br/>
n((((Yes~))))n<br/>
n(Yes, nOur Kingn.)n<br/>
nThe usual Water Spirits and the Great Water Spirit Undine answered.n<br/>
nAlright, preparations made.n<br/>
n“[Mist].” (Makoto)n<br/>
nIt all happened yesterday, so of course they are on alert.n<br/>
nThere’s a lot of monsters keeping watch.n<br/>
nI use Detection to search for places with the least amount of guards.n<br/>
nOn top of that, I use Stealth to erase my presence.n<br/>
nIt is one-patterned, but it is the safest method.n<br/>
nHero Abel also had the same Skills.n<br/>
nWell, it must be necessary in these times.n<br/>
nWe slowly closed the distance from the back of the Demon Lord Castle. n<br/>
nThere’s obviously guards in the back gate too.n<br/>
nIs there no place to sneak in…?n<br/>
nThe Demon Lord Castle is big and the monsters are gigantic too.n<br/>
nIt would be nice to have an opening somewhere that a human could slip into though…n<br/>
n(There’s a lot of monsters and demons though…) (Makoto)n<br/>
nThe reactions from Detection are incomparable to yesterday’s.n<br/>
nI thought they would be going out to search for the Heroes, but…I was wrong.n<br/>
nI see.n<br/>
nThey have Momo as a hostage.n<br/>
nOf course they would be wary here as well…n<br/>
nThis is troubling.n<br/>
nIt was at that moment…n<br/>
n“Makoto-sama…?” n<br/>
nWhile I was searching the surroundings of the Demon Lord Castle, my name was called.n<br/>
n“?!”n<br/>
nThere’s only 4 people in this world who know my name.n<br/>
nThat’s why I know the owner of that voice.n<br/>
nI desperately search for the owner of that voice.n<br/>
nThere.n<br/>
nMomo.n<br/>
n“Wa?!” n<br/>
nSeeing that figure of hers, I was at a loss for words from the shock.n<br/>
nHer attire is different from the last time I saw her.n<br/>
nIt is like she is a servant, or more like, she is wearing maid clothes, but that’s certainly Momo.n<br/>
nBut her attire is of no importance right now.n<br/>
n“Makoto! D-Don’t. We couldn’t make it in time. This girl is already…” (Abel)n<br/>
nThe words of Hero Abel didn’t reach my ears.n<br/>
nI approached Momo with unsteady feet.n<br/>
n“…Makoto-sama. Don’t. You must not come here…” (Momo)n<br/>
n“Momo…” (Makoto)n<br/>
nThat’s right. n<br/>
nI must apologize.n<br/>
nEven though it was for my mission, I didn’t protect Momo who I promised to, and prioritized Hero Abel.n<br/>
nBut my thoughts were in disarray.n<br/>
n“Makoto-san, please…get away from her! That girl…has become a vampire!” (Abel)n<br/>
nHero Abel shouted.n<br/>
nThe face of Momo warped in sadness.n<br/>
nVampire…?n<br/>
n“I have become the familiar of Demon Lord Bifrons. I have become your enemy…” (Momo)n<br/>
nMomo hung her head down and said this with a shrivelled up voice.n<br/>
nMomo’s hair was pure white.n<br/>
nHer black eyes had turned crimson.n<br/>
nHer small lips had fangs peeking out.n<br/>
nBut what surprised me wasn’t that.n<br/>
nThe face of Momo was familiar.n<br/>
nA person I am very familiar with.n<br/>
nA person that has helped me out many times.n<br/>
nWhy didn’t I notice?n<br/>
nBecause her way of speaking was different?n<br/>
nBecause her eyes were different? n<br/>
nThat person was always overflowing with confidence.n<br/>
n(You said that I didn’t meet you…) (Makoto)n<br/>
nLiar.n<br/>
nNo matter how I look at her, Momo is…the Great Sage-sama.n<br/>
n—Author Comment:n<br/>
nIt was very obvious, but the name of the Great Sage-sama has been revealed.n<br/>
nI have left her name unknown all this time.n<br/>
nIt wasn’t foreshadowing, but since ‘Chapter 56: Takatsuki Makoto speaks to the Great Sage-sama’, I have been writing the Great Sage-sama with the premise that she has memories of Makoto.n<br/>
n> “You sit here.” n<br/>
n> For some reason my seat was made to be at the side of the Great Sage.n<br/>
nIt was around here.n<br/>
nSince the 2nd Arc, writing the scene of the Great Sage-sama and Makoto meeting 1,000 years in the past was one of the number one scenes I wanted to write. I am personally really satisfied having been able to write it.n<br/>
