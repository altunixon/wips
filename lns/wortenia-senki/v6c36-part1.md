“Well, before we get into the main subject, let me say hello again.”<br/>
Ryoma turns his gaze to Douglas and identifies himself.<br/>
“My name is Ryoma Mikoshiba. I have been given the status of a baron from the Kingdom of Roselia and has taken control of the Waltenia Peninsula and the northern part of this country. Well, it is now, but “<br/>
That said, Ryoma gave a small shrug.<br/>
I felt a little embarrassed. <br/>
Well, from Ryoma’s point of view, it’s a rather old-fashioned phrase, so it’s only natural.<br/>
And it’s true now.<br/>
A few days ago, Douglas went to the villa of Count Salzberg, where Ryoma was staying, as a messenger to the House of Lords.<br/>
There’s no way Douglas doesn’t know who the man in front of him is. <br/>
However, it is a greeting between a nobleman with a title, even if it is a lower-ranking aristocrat.<br/>
It may be new, but it cannot be ignored.<br/>
“Oh … my name is Douglas Hamilton. I’m a relative of Count Hamilton … I’m sorry for the other day. If you have any questions, please feel free to contact me…”<br/>
Douglas returns a greeting.<br/>
That said, he was stuttering with his words and it’s pretty awkward.<br/>
From a certain point of view, there were problems with this type of greetings.<br/>
It is common for people of low status to pay respects to the person with higher status<br/>
Even in modern society, where it is said that there is no identification system, hierarchical relationships are created due to differences in age and social position.<br/>
Employees and part-time workers, parents and children, students and teachers.<br/>
In addition to these, it can be said that human society is a complex combination of innumerable relationships.<br/>
Of course, in modern society, even if you don’t greet your superiors, it is unlikely that you will die for it.<br/>
At best, if you don’t have common sense, you’ll be hit in the back and your evaluation will go down.<br/>
However, it is a life-threatening problem even in the earthly world with an identification system, especially in the Kingdom of Roselia, which is said to be strict.<br/>
In some cases, you can be killed for being a rude person.<br/>
Of course, this time it was an exception because Ryoma gave a quick greeting.<br/>
Also, this is in the House of Lords, and Douglas does not have the title, but considering that he is not a commoner, it is unlikely that it will be such an important thing.<br/>
However, it is certainly polite to bow down to Douglas.<br/>
Of course, Douglas understands that.<br/>
As long as he is a relative of Count Hamilton, he has been thoroughly trained in such manners and rituals since he was a child.<br/>
Originally, the greetings would have been exchanged with fluency that flowed without stagnation.<br/>
That said, from Douglas’s point of view, that’s not unreasonable.<br/>
After all, the position is clearly different between a few days ago and now.<br/>
Of course, the winner is Ryoma Mikoshiba and the loser is Douglas.<br/>
However, Ryoshin does not take that seriously.<br/>
In that case, on the contrary, Douglas is wondering what kind of attitude he should take.<br/>
For Douglas, it feels like he’s dead.<br/>
However, while watching Douglas’s bewildered appearance, Ryoma only smiles.<br/>
Of course, that’s not because it’s friendly or generous to Douglas.<br/>
No matter how Douglas feels, it would be correct to say that he is not interested.　<br/>
In fact, Ryoma’s call to Douglas doesn’t mean anything more than getting a job.<br/>
(Well, the story will not proceed as it is……?)<br/>
Ryoma is not interested in Douglas personally.<br/>
Targeting Douglas this time does not mean that he has a grudge or hostility towards him personally.<br/>
For Ryoma, it’s just a tool that is necessary for the success of his plan.　　<br/>
And when choosing which tools to use, when Douglas picked him up at Count Salzberg’s residence the other day, he offered a reasonable service while accepting a bribe for giving various considerations to Ryoma. It’s just that I decided to ask Douglas for a job.<br/>
Also, it would be correct in the sense of insurance to have kidnapped the family.<br/>
After all, Douglas once received the money but didn’t pay for it.<br/>
Most people will get angry and complain that they paid for it and didn’t receive the right services and goods.<br/>
Well, Douglas is certainly sorry for what he has done, but given that he has already received the compensation, all the hardships he has suffered can only be said to be rust from his body.<br/>
In order to use the tools properly, it will be necessary to take care of them.　<br/>
“Well, calm down a little. I’m not trying to eat you are anything. If you like, drink some water … Come on.”<br/>
With that said, Ryoma calmed down Douglas as he visited the area in a restless manner.<br/>
Douglas’s body trembles for a moment at Ryoma’s words.<br/>
However, he may have calmed down a little.<br/>
But in any case, when Douglas grabbed the glass in front of him, he certainly drank the water in one breath.<br/>
“Excuse me … so why am I here?”<br/>
Ryoma nods satisfactorily to that question.　<br/>
“Well, I really wanted to ask Mr. Douglas for a job.”<br/>
“Work…… is it?”<br/>
The moment he said the word, Douglas was struck by a fierce chill.<br/>
It is a bad feeling<br/>
However, that unpleasant feeling is nothing more than a feeling that Douglas felt without any theory or reason.<br/>
It is the same level as bagua.<br/>
“Even if I say work, the thing I want to ask is not a big deal. Well, it might be a little dangerous.”<br/>
A word that really has implications.<br/>
And Douglas is not foolish enough to read the nuances contained in that subtext. Novel writing software<br/>
