Side Story – The Daily Life of Villainess<br/>
.<br/>
──Rialhama Kingdom.<br/>
This kingdom was located at the south east part of Oustralis Continent, the continent to the south of Aurelia Continent. In the past it was a medium level nation that was ranked sixth among the thirteen countries in this continent.<br/>
However the arrival of the exploration ship Gabriel from Sanjuan Kingdom to their port became a blessing for this country. For a time this country monopolized the trade with Aurelia Continent and rapidly grew in strength.<br/>
It brought in numerous advanced technologies that didn’t exist in Oustralis Continent from Sanjuan Kingdom and Trystovy Kingdom. Before anyone realized it this country had climbed up to rank third. Rialhama Kingdom was enjoying an unprecedented prosperity.<br/>
Faysal who was the first person of this kingdom to cross the sea and met Jose and Baldr was rated highly for his connections. And then in contrast to his wish, he was enthroned as the twelfth king of Rialhama Kingdom at the end of some dramatic events.<br/>
It was a story that happened nearly twenty years ago already.<br/>
The era had changed and the trade with Aurelia Continent gradually wasn’t being monopolized by Rialhama Kingdom alone anymore.<br/>
Even so Rialhama Kingdom was still the country with deepest interaction with Aurelia Continent in Oustralis Continent.<br/>
The symbol of that was Rialhama Kingdom royal academy──commonly known as Emerald Wood.<br/>
The source of that name was the fact that it was built at the shore of Moor Lake that had emerald green color.<br/>
The academy gathered children of noted families from many countries and acted as a place of cultural exchange. Not only Trystovy Kingdom, there were even overseas students from Mauricia Kingdom and Sanjuan Kingdom who kept coming to enroll here.<br/>
Even among those overseas students, Diana from Trystovy Kingdom and Constantia from Sanjuan Kingdom were especially popular.<br/>
People called those two girls as the White Rose of Snow and Dahlia of Passion that bloomed at the north.<br/>
The one standing equal with those two girls which caused the popularity in Emerald Wood to be split in three was the young daughter of Baron Shaheen, Laila. She was nicknamed as the Peony of Radiance.<br/>
Laila’s social status was relatively low in Emerald Wood that gathered excellent noble children, but the reason she was able to gain this much popularity was thanks to her candid personality and alluring glamour as expected.<br/>
Constantia had an average figure, but unfortunately Dahlia’s symbol of motherhood couldn’t be said as big even for flattery.<br/>
Although anyone who had anything to say about it would definitely faint in agony from a hellish thrust that couldn’t be seen with naked eyes. Diana wouldn’t be perturbed against most insult, but her reaction toward the words 「small breast」 tended to be excessive.<br/>
Even so Diana who was reigning at the top of the academy was a special existence as expected.<br/>
Her aura was just different.<br/>
Her casual gesture and atmosphere was radiating a pressure that made others felt the difference of status between them that had existed from birth.<br/>
That displeased Laila.<br/>
Her charm as woman absolutely wasn’t inferior compared to those two. Rather she was superior than them.<br/>
And yet, if a ranking was created for the three of them, anyone would answer that in the first place was Diana, Constantia at the second place, and Laila at the third place.<br/>
──Even though the two of them were only lucky to be born with high status!<br/>
Laila was harboring a very deep resentment that she had never shown outwardly at the slightest.<br/>
Than even more shocking sad news came to her.<br/>
The engagement between the first prince of Rialhama Kingdom and Diana was announced.<br/>
That woman who was already at her hate list would become the most noble woman of this Rialhama Kingdom?<br/>
Laila was so angry that she collapsed from fever for three days.<br/>
But, it seemed that Ishak wasn’t happy with this engagement.<br/>
「……It’s also not easy to get along with a haughty woman.」<br/>
When Laila accidentally heard those words of Ishak, she began to scheme…….<br/>
.<br/>
Although it was disrespectful to say this, but Ishak wasn’t a prince with really good evaluation.<br/>
He was only respected as a prince just because Faysal accidentally became a king. Originally he was in a position where sooner or later his status as royalty would be dropped to the status of subject and he would have to worry about finding a place of employment.<br/>
Perhaps that was why he had a tendency to be in ecstasy from being respected as a prince.<br/>
In other words, he was getting carried away.<br/>
For someone like him, a foreigner like Diana who didn’t treat him as a special being at all wasn’t someone he was good with.<br/>
Even though Ishak wanted to be spoiled, Diana would point at his flaws from an equal standpoint instead. Laila spontaneously cheered happily when she heard that the relationship of the two wasn’t really going well.<br/>
She was struck with a devilish plan that would grant all her wishes at that moment.<br/>
First Laila mobilized all of her connections to spread bad rumors about Diana.<br/>
It would be a success if the rumors entered Ishak’s ears.<br/>
That girl always talked self-importantly, but she actually has bad rumors about her like this.<br/>
There was no need for the rumors to be true. Ishak just need that kind of excuse to disparage the person he disliked.<br/>
Ishak quickly put a distance between Diana and him. He also stopped listening to Diana’s advice.<br/>
On top of that, Laila approached Ishak while acting innocent.<br/>
Of course she didn’t openly show affection toward someone who already had fiancée.<br/>
She dressed up everything as a coincidence, for example she would pretend to fall while carrying class materials to push her chest on Ishak, she would lie in wait along Ishak’s route and sang the song she was good at or frolicking with small animals.<br/>
The efforts she put into her various approaches bore fruit. Laila was able to get into a close relationship with Ishak.<br/>
However Laila’s action didn’t really garner much criticism. As expected Diana’s status as foreigner also worked against her.<br/>
Until now this historical Rialhama Kingdom had never welcomed woman from other country to be queen.<br/>
The nobles who voiced their opposition toward that matter numbered quite many.<br/>
Although the quick-witted nobles would immediately approach Diana and Constantia.<br/>
Even so it could be denied that those nobles were in the minority compared to Laila’s faction.<br/>
An accident where those two factions clashed finally occurred.<br/>
It started at the dining hall when a girl from Laila’s faction flared up at Diana.<br/>
「Can you quit it already?」<br/>
「What are you saying out of nowhere? Or rather, who are you again?」<br/>
The aforementioned girl was enraged because Diana didn’t even know her name.<br/>
「I am Tiffany of Rajib House! I’m asking you to stop your harassment to Lady Laila!」<br/>
「Me? When?」<br/>
「How shameless! There is witness of how you tear up Lady Laila’s textbook and threw it into trash can yesterday!」<br/>
「How can you be so horrible! Diana-sama!」<br/>
Laila didn’t forget to show a performance like a victim while crying uu uu uu.<br/>
「──Hou, it’s strange that you say there is a witness.」<br/>
Constantia cut into the conversation with delight.<br/>
She was a girl with a neat and mature appearance, but actually no one could beat her in wickedness.<br/>
She had truly inherited the blood of his father who was an extraordinary strategist despite his unmotivated attitude and her mother who was a demon in business trade.<br/>
「Enough with your lies!」<br/>
「I think this matter will become something dreadful if it’s not a lie though.」<br/>
「It’s pointless even if you try to tamper with the testimony using your influence!」<br/>
「Hmph……then you are saying that you have definitely witnessed the textbook getting torn?」<br/>
「That’s right!」<br/>
「Naturally, you have the resolve to give testimony if this matter is brought to the court right?」<br/>
Tiffany still hadn’t noticed that Constantia was gradually cutting off her path of retreat.<br/>
「Threat won’t be able to overturn justice!」<br/>
「I see. Yesterday Diana went to observe a diplomatic wining with her majesty the queen though. Just now you announced that the queen’s testimony is a lie. You really have guts.」<br/>
「Eh? The queen? Eh?」<br/>
「You definitely saw it right?」<br/>
「I-i-it, it wasn’t me. Yes, there was someone else who saw it……I think there was someone, like at that time……」<br/>
The name of someone who was dangerous to go against suddenly came out. Tiffany’s complexion turned as white as a sheet and her words became incoherent.<br/>
Laila quietly withdrew and clicked her tongue.<br/>
She never expected Diana to go with the queen yesterday. This woman had the luck of the devil.<br/>
「Then can you quickly bring that so called witness here? Diana has an appointment to meet with her majesty again after this.」<br/>
「R-r-right you are. I too was only hearing about this from someone else so I’ll go quickly to confirm it. Then pardon me.」<br/>
Tiffany rattled on and on before she left from the dining hall right away.<br/>
Laila’s hangers-on also ran away in a flash to avoid Constantia’s gaze.<br/>
No matter what, not a single one of them wanted to get into a fight with the queen.<br/>
(I failed……as I thought I need to confirm her alibi first……my plan will go up in smoke if I turn the queen into enemy……)<br/>
She couldn’t give herself away by doing things carelessly.<br/>
Laila decided that first she should focus on seducing the prince.<br/>
.<br/>
Constantia stared at Laila who was secretly running away with a dark gaze. Then she asked her best friend Diana.<br/>
「And, what are you planning to do?」<br/>
「Let’s see……」<br/>
Diana twirled her finger on her prided silver hair and smiled mischievously.<br/>
「Perhaps it’ll be better if I go along with that woman’s ulterior motive. Because that prince, he doesn’t fit my taste.」<br/>
「This fathercon.」<br/>
Diana pouted in displeasure when Constantia pointed that out.<br/>
That expression made a really wide gap with her usual cool and stiff beauty. She looked really enchanting and adorable.<br/>
Constantia stuck out her tongue inside her heart. Surely that Ishak had never seen this cute face of Diana even once.<br/>
「In this world there is no man that can rival your father. You will become an old spinster if you don’t learn to compromise a little you know?」<br/>
Constantia poked at where it hurt. Diana grimaced hearing that.<br/>
「I get it! Just half is fine. At the very least it should be someone half as strong, cool, popular, resourceful, knowledgeable, and good in business like Otou-sama. Am I asking too much with that?」<br/>
Constantia was completely exasperated with her friend’s late stage father complex and shrugged.<br/>
「You’re obviously asking too much! Don’t look down on marriage.」<br/>
「How harsh society is, I can’t even say what I want to say.」<br/>
「I’ll tattle to your beloved father if you don’t stop screwing around you know!」<br/>
Diana clung on Constantia tearfully.<br/>
「Please not that!」<br/>
.<br/>
Laila was convinced of her victory.<br/>
Ishak’s heart was already within her grasp completely.<br/>
Unlike Diana who wouldn’t even allow him to hold her hand, Laila and Ishak were already in physical relationship.<br/>
She didn’t give a damn to something like chastity.<br/>
A woman should fight using any kind of method if it was for the sake of catching a man.<br/>
And then her plan was finally going to be executed tonight when Ishak would be declared as the crown prince.<br/>
Diana appeared in the assembly hall tonight wearing a splendid ultramarine dress without any idea at all about that.<br/>
Even Laila was forced to acknowledge that Dian’s mystical silver hair and ultramarine dress really suited her cool beauty.<br/>
(But so what? You will be disgraced tonight!)<br/>
Laila suppressed her reflexive urge to laugh loudly.<br/>
Her man got taken away from her because she was stingy in using that seedy-looking body.<br/>
「I have something to announce to you ladies and gentlemen who have gathered here.」<br/>
Ishak held Laila’s hand and raised his voice loudly toward the people in the hall.<br/>
The inside of the hall became noisy wondering what this was about.<br/>
Although today was the day of the crown prince appointment, the king hadn’t even arrived yet. So it was impossible for the announcement to be made now.<br/>
「I annul my engagement with the count’s daughter Lady Diana Cornelius and pledge my engagement with the baron’s daughter Lady Laila Shahin right here and now!」<br/>
The storm of applause that Ishak and Diana expected to break out here didn’t happen.<br/>
Nobody was able to accept the reality that was occurring right now.<br/>
Ishak’s mood was harmed by that and he raised his voice.<br/>
「Diana, I’m disappointed with you. I heard that you have been misusing your status to bully a girl without any backing like Laila.」<br/>
「I don’t remember ever doing anything like that. Or rather, that person’s name is Laila? This is the first time I hear about it.」<br/>
Laila snapped. Her wounded pride caused a vein to pulse on her forehead strongly.<br/>
「You are really horrible Diana-sama, even though you have insulted, ostracized, and held me back so many times before this!」<br/>
「That’s right! Your excuse is unsightly!」<br/>
A young man with aristocratic air who looked like someone really clever stepped forward to support Laila.<br/>
Laila glanced at that while the corner of her lips rose in triumph.<br/>
「Good grief, this is why foreigner cannot be trusted!」<br/>
And then one more person with his discriminating attitude completely laid bare glared at Diana.<br/>
These two were the son of knight order commander Arye and the son of the prime minister Mubarak.<br/>
Laila had picked them in order to oppose Diana.<br/>
As expected Laila didn’t have any connection with incumbent ministers or the king, so she moved to ally herself with the noble children who had the most influence inside Emerald Wood, and she succeeded.<br/>
With Mubarak and Arye also supporting Laila on top of the prince, the atmosphere of the hall was rapidly turning cold toward Diana.<br/>
「There are only incomprehensible idiots here……」<br/>
「What did you say?」<br/>
This line was Diana’s favorite. It was one of the lines that her father sometimes used with a faraway look. The feeling as though she became a god of a new world when saying this line was unbearable.<br/>
「──You made your announcement in this kind of event in front of everyone present, so you must have hardened your resolve……」<br/>
Diana laughed in joy. There wasn’t any agitation or humiliation or fear in her tone.<br/>
Laila was unable to forgive that.<br/>
「Ishak-sama! Laila is scared!」<br/>
She explicitly urged Ishak to continue by hugging his chest.<br/>
「So you still dare to threaten Laila even now! You have slighted my future queen. Don’t think that you can get away unscathed anymore!」<br/>
「I wonder who is the one who won’t get unscathed.」<br/>
Constantia replied to Ishak in Diana’s place.<br/>
「Diana and I are students of Emerald Wood, but we are also diplomats who represent Trystovy Kingdom and Sanjuan Kingdom at the same time. Even your highness aren’t allowed to arbitrarily dealt a punishment to us.」<br/>
「You insolent! How dare you act so rudely toward his highness!」<br/>
Arye glared at Constantia. He looked like he was going to rush off to attack her already.<br/>
「It will be a different story if you have the resolve to go into war with our countries though.」<br/>
Any decent noble would be shocked when the possibility of war was hinted so clearly like this.<br/>
After all those with comprehension understood that the prosperity of this Rialhama Kingdom came from their friendly relations with Aurelia Continent.<br/>
「There’s no country that will go to war just for a single little girl! And even if it become a war, our country will win hands down against mere trivial country like yours!」<br/>
It was unknown whether those words were said seriously or as bluffing.<br/>
Arye yelled those words furiously. Ishak also nodded in agreement with him.<br/>
Diana covered her mouth with a fan seeing that. She laughed with a high-pitched voice.<br/>
Her laughter really sounded delighted. It was a voice that would make anyone who listen to be thrilled.<br/>
「Aa, how sad it is to be so ignorant. It’s still too early for you boys to play soldiers you know? How about going back to your mama to get consoled while you still haven’t stumbled and skinned your knee?」<br/>
「You! I won’t go easy on you anymore just because you’re a woman!」<br/>
Arye moved to grab Diana in rage. Constantia sighed and held her head in her hands seeing that.<br/>
「Otou-sama’s style──Tsurube Otoshi!」<br/>
「Gugya!」<br/>
One attack. Arye with his body that looked heavier than 100 kg no matter how anyone looked at him floated in the air, and then the back of his head hit the floor and he fainted.<br/>
Even those who were watching that happened couldn’t comprehend what in the world happened.<br/>
They could only comprehend that the tough guy who contended for the first or second spot as the strongest in the academy, the one who was thought that he would be in charge the knight order in the future got defeated in an instant.<br/>
「How dare you do that to Arye-sama!」<br/>
Laila was gritting her teeth inside her heart from this miscalculation. Even so she acted scared once more.<br/>
「Yes, I can’t overlook your violence anymore than this! Knights! Restrain that person!」<br/>
The number of knights in charge of this hall’s security was fifty.<br/>
In addition thirty guards who were directly in charge of the king’s safety were also planned to join them later.<br/>
There were several hundreds more of them stationed outside the hall.<br/>
As expected Diana had overdone it.<br/>
Even though everyone there was thinking that, no, only Constantia and the overseas students from Aurelia Continent were the only one not thinking like that. They even felt pity because they knew of the tragedy that would occur after this.<br/>
「You will always be a little boy forever because you don’t understand what you can and cannot do. Sorry but it’s one hundred years too early for you to be my romantic partner.」<br/>
She didn’t even consider him a man. Ishak blew up into a rage from being told that and yelled.<br/>
「I don’t care even if you guys get a little rough! No, teach it to her body of her place! She will surely learn a little manners if that smug face of hers get scarred.」<br/>
「──Whose face you say you’re going to scar?」<br/>
「Heboa!」<br/>
Ishak received an impact on his face and he was blown away without even knowing what had happened to him.<br/>
Laila who was clinging on his arm also got blown away along with him.<br/>
「Ah, Obaa-sama(grandmother)」<br/>
Abundant silver hair that lengthened until the waist fluttered. A woman whose appearance looked like she was still in her forty casually walked toward the knights.<br/>
「W-who?」<br/>
「You insolent person dare to raise your hand toward his highness the prince!」<br/>
「Aaa\~\~a? What’s wrong with me punishing the idiot who dare to act violent toward my granddaughter!」<br/>
The knights flinched back by the pressure.<br/>
──Everything is overrrrrrrr! The people here who were from Aurelia Continent already let go of their capacity to think.<br/>
「D-don’t move!」<br/>
「You guys couldn’t be sloppier than this. I’m already moving.」<br/>
「Eh……」<br/>
*Bam bam bam bam*<br/>
There wasn’t even any time to blink. The knights fell forward one after another and stopped moving altogether.<br/>
「Hiih! A-are they dead?」<br/>
「I don’t kill them. I want to kill you though.」<br/>
「Hiiiiiiiiiih! Wake up! Wake up already! Wake up I said!」<br/>
Laila shook the neck of Ishak whose consciousness was blown away back and forth. She was desperate to get away from the approaching death god.<br/>
「U, uu\~\~nn……」<br/>
Ishak regained his consciousness hazily from his head getting shaken.<br/>
「Ishak-sama! Save me! There is a monster!」<br/>
「Mu, how dare you act violently to me the prince! Knights, what are you all doing just standing around. Call for reinforcement!」<br/>
Ishak’s face was pale although he was saying that. His cheek got slapped really hard by the aforementioned woman. The pain was spreading stingingly until the top of his head.<br/>
「No matter how many you call here, at their level they won’t even be able to help me killing time.」<br/>
Even though the woman didn’t look like she had even moved a step in the amateur’s eyes, the knights kept falling one by one when they felt a wind blowing.<br/>
It didn’t even take thirty seconds until the knights were annihilated.<br/>
For the first time since he was born, Ishak felt the fear that he might really get killed.<br/>
「Mubarak! Save me!」<br/>
「Forgive me prince. Unlike Arye, my strength is nonexistent……」<br/>
「Is there no patriotic noble here!」<br/>
Ishak looked around him pleadingly, but nobody moved. To be more accurate they were unable to move.<br/>
It was a mice’s instinct to run from cat. A mice couldn’t stand up to cat.<br/>
「What is going on here!」<br/>
Rialhama Kingdom’s king Faysal I arrived at that timing.<br/>
──I’m saved!<br/>
Ishak was relieved from  the bottom of his heart and yelled pleadingly at his father.<br/>
「Please save me Chichi-ue! Please hand down judgment to that monster over there and that cheeky Diana!」<br/>
「YOU STUPID IDIOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOT!」<br/>
「Hidebuh!」<br/>
Faysal’s full powered fist that was backed with a running start landed on Ishak’s jaw.<br/>
Ishak couldn’t endure it and got sent flying. Laila also got dragged into it again.<br/>
「No, please wait! I’m just trying to chastise that ill-natured woman who is bullying Laila!」<br/>
「I don’t give a damn! A woman who dare to leer at a prince with fiancée can just go die for all I care!」<br/>
「No way……」<br/>
Faysal’s words were too harsh for a girl her age. Laila shed tears with a wounded look.<br/>
If one only looked at that, that was certainly a picturesque expression. Her gesture was terribly striking.<br/>
As expected Ishak’s chivalrous mentality was greatly stimulated and he embraced Laila.<br/>
Though he looked slightly idiotic with both his cheeks swollen.<br/>
「Chichi-ue, I love Laila! Unlike a wicked woman with twisted nature like Diana, I can’t help but fall in love with Laila’s beautiful and kind heart!」<br/>
.<br/>
「Faysal-dono, is this kid picking a fight? For him to call my adorable and charming princess as someone ill-natured, this means war.」<br/>
.<br/>
A big man appeared from behind Faysal. He had silver hair and growing a moustache, but he had youthful appearance that was currently blazing with furious aura.<br/>
「K-King Baldr! Madam Maggot! Please forgive him! I humbly asked! Earnestly!」<br/>
「What are you doing Chichi-ue?」<br/>
「You damn idiot! Who do you think you’re picking a fight with!?」<br/>
「Hogerah!」<br/>
It was a magnificent uppercut. These two, they had quite the talent to form a comedic duo as the funny man and the straight man.<br/>
「Even though I had been asking his majesty Baldr for ten years for his permission to her highness Diana’s engagement in order to guarantee our country’s safety for ten years to come before he finally allowed, it, and yet you, you bastard actually-!」<br/>
「Eh? Isn’t she the daughter of Count Cornelius?」<br/>
Laila naively asked. Faysal answered her while glaring as though she was his parent’s murderer.<br/>
「That’s just an alias that she used so that it won’t cause any large wave in this academy! Ishak, I already told you about this before!」<br/>
「Come to think of it, I think I recall being told something like that……」<br/>
「This damn fool!」<br/>
「It hurt! Chichi-ue, then so what if she is a princess? Why does the king need to act that servile to a king of other country?」<br/>
「Because the difference in strength is just that great, STUPIIIIIIIIIIIID!」<br/>
「Habububububububu!」<br/>
This time Faysal’s full powered slaps exploded.<br/>
「His majesty Baldr is the leader of the Grand Union in Aurelia Continent. His military strength, economic strength, technological strength, all of them are more than ten times of our country. If he join hand with a country like Burundi Kingdom for example, our country will fall into ruin in less than half a year!」<br/>
「H-how can that possibly……」<br/>
Ishak almost said that his father was exaggerating, but his words got caught in his throat.<br/>
Before he realized it, Baldr was right in front of him and choked his neck with one hand.<br/>
It was a quickness that looked like he teleported.<br/>
「What can you do to me when your force is already fewer than mine?」<br/>
Bring 100 or 1000 if you want. I’ll slaughter them all.<br/>
If you want to go to war, I’ll crush a country like Rialhama Kingdom like a sand castle.<br/>
Even Ishak could feel that was how Baldr was feeling even though he wasn’t saying anything.<br/>
Or rather, his instinct as a living thing was telling him of the absolute gap between the two of them.<br/>
「Hihi, hiiiih!」<br/>
Ishak peed himself and his eyes rolled back. Baldr threw him away like a dirty rag.<br/>
「Otou-sama is so cool!」<br/>
「Aa, I’m sorry that I’m late, my cute princess.」<br/>
The parent and child started to flirt without any care of the public eye. Constantia muttered 「The cause of that girl’s fathercon is absolutely from his majesty」.<br/>
For some reason her fellow overseas students were also nodding in agreement.<br/>
「And so, consider my princess’s marriage is cancelled.」<br/>
「P-p-p-, please wait! Please! Please give one more chance with my second son!」<br/>
「Then what are you going to do with that guy?」<br/>
Baldr jerked his chin to point at Ishak. Faysal answered without any delay.<br/>
「I’ll strip the royalty status from this idiot and banish him! However although I’m ashamed to ask this, please at least spare him from death sentence!」<br/>
He was a hopelessly stupid son without any redeeming point at all, even so Faysal was also responsible for raising him whimsically in the past when he didn’t have any intention to inherit the throne.<br/>
For Faysal, that was a line that he couldn’t cross.<br/>
「Are you fine with that Diana?」<br/>
「I don’t mind if I can annul my engagement with this person.」<br/>
「Wait a second!」<br/>
Laila who was being completely ignored sensed that the situation was gradually moving in an outrageous direction, so she raised her voice in protest.<br/>
「Today should be the day for Ishak-sama to be the crown prince!」<br/>
「It has been decided just now that he will be banished though?」<br/>
「That’s just strange! Why does the first prince get banished? That won’t be a happy ending for the heroine!」<br/>
「……You can see here how the princess’s engagement with the stupid and worthless princess get cancelled so she can live together with her father in her homeland. And they all lived happily ever after.」<br/>
「I’m not talking about your story! Or rather, why does the father get mentioned there, that’s fatherco……gafuh!」<br/>
Laila couldn’t finish speaking. She got hit by Diana’s hellish thrust to the throat and fainted in agony.<br/>
「Take them away.」<br/>
With Faysal’s order, Ishak and Laila got dragged outside.<br/>
Laila kept yelling things like 「The scenario!」 or 「The flag!」 while continuing to resist being dragged away.<br/>
Those phrases that he had heard from somewhere also weighed in Baldr’s mind, but he purposefully ignored it.<br/>
Because she was his daughter’s enemy.<br/>
「How about you learn to let go of your daughter already?」<br/>
Baldr’s idiotic parent behavior was going off the rail so much that even idiotic grandparent like Maggot reflexively warned him.<br/>
「Say, Otou-sama. I don’t want to go marry to other family or anything.」<br/>
「That’s fine. Diana can stay with daddy forever.」<br/>
「I’m happy! Otou-sama!」<br/>
「Ha-ha-ha! You are still a kid huh Diana.」<br/>
.<br/>
Even that happy circle of parent and daughter was immediately erased away by Silk’s lightning as soon as they returned home.<br/>
「I won’t allow my daughter to be middle-aged woman who missed her chance to marry! I forbid you two to meet each other for a while without my permission!」<br/>
「「No way\~\~\~\~!」」<br/>
