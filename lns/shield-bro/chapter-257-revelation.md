Chapter 257: Revelation<br/>
"Now then, where was I again?" (Naofumi)<br/>
We somehow finished lunch, so I returned to my training.<br/>
I’ll have to think of another punishment for Kiel.<br/>
Ren left with a group to go peddle.<br/>
It seems that he’s working diligently, and Female Knight is with him, so it should be fine.<br/>
Female Knight never got brainwashed during the incident.<br/>
However, she became greatly troubled over the nature of Justice due to it.<br/>
She sure likes to beat herself up.<br/>
But I’ll deal with that problem at another time.<br/>
Right now, I’m training for battle.<br/>
By sucking in Chi from the outside, I can hasten my SP and Mana recovery.<br/>
That’s efficient in itself. I can see it having a lot of uses.<br/>
However, it’s disappointing that I can’t use the convenient skill known as Mussou Kassei.<br/>
"Fumu…" (Naofumi)<br/>
"Master, what’s wrong?" (Firo)<br/>
"Well, I’m thinking of how to apply it to my skills. 「Shield Prison」!" (Naofumi)<br/>
I test to see what happens if I mix the Chi in the air, and my internal Chi… My magic and SP when I use a skill.<br/>
Checking my status, I can see that the SP cost was cut by quite a bit.<br/>
Its flaw is that I cannot use it immediately. It’s quite difficult.<br/>
"How is it, Atlas?" (Naofumi)<br/>
"Yes, the prison feels much more complete than before. I don’t think even I would be able to find its weak points and break it." (Atlas)<br/>
"I see." (Naofumi)<br/>
It seems that the skill’s effect also increased.<br/>
And with the cost reduction, I’ve learned something nice.<br/>
I need to get this to a state where it’s usable in battle.<br/>
Take in energy from the outside, join it with my internal power and convert that energy into a skill.<br/>
The skills that haven’t been able to protect anybody lately may become quite useful.<br/>
My Meteor Shield and Shield Prison seem to get destroyed every single time. I was worried if I would be able to use them in battles to come.<br/>
If I can decrease the activation time, and increase the accuracy, I can try strengthening my skills in battle.<br/>
Hmm?<br/>
Wait a second. Isn’t this similar to something?<br/>
Isn’t this the same fundamental theory as the Dragon Pulse Law?<br/>
… Right.<br/>
It was a magic where you gather power from the outside, and use your internal power to set it off.<br/>
That seems to be what I’m attempting at the moment.<br/>
If I can apply it to skills, can I use it in magic?<br/>
I can. Probably.<br/>
Yeah, I better test it.<br/>
"Did something happen?" (Firo)<br/>
"Wait there for a second." (Naofumi)<br/>
I take a deep breath, and begin chanting magic.<br/>
I use my body as a medium to borrow power from the area.<br/>
Right now, I need to rely on the power on the outside… and the power called SP from my shield.<br/>
And my magic… I hold it back. I’ll use it seperately<br/>
I take in Chi, and lead its flow like a complex puzzle.<br/>
At the same time, I picture a magic chant.<br/>
Uwah… This is really hard.<br/>
The puzzle I need to make shows itself to me.<br/>
If I don’t concentrate with all my might, it won’t be solved. If I move, it will immediately shatter.<br/>
Even so… I construct the puzzle under this pressure.<br/>
Good, with this, It’s complete.<br/>
It’s not the best, but I was able to make it.<br/>
"I, the Hero of the Shield, order the heavens. Cut off reason, retie it and release it. Power of the Dragon Pulse, with my Magic and my power as a Hero, I, the Shield, who has understood the origin of power command. Let the truth of creation once more be read forth and manifest, Give all his things to me."<br/>
The Chant was freakin’ long.<br/>
I’m impressed that I was even able to chant it.<br/>
It’ll be a little difficult to use in real battles.<br/>
But still, I did it.<br/>
Using the Dragon Pulse, I can see just how different its structure is from normal magic.<br/>
The foundation is definitely the same, but the difficulty is different.<br/>
The magic I make with my own power from this world’s words focuses on ease of release. But you need to be able to memorize the higher class spells from the start.<br/>
But casting magic to obstruct another’s spells takes too much time.<br/>
Contrarily, the Dragon Pulse Law makes the user assemble the power flowing into them.<br/>
There’s no set chant.<br/>
Because there’s no set formula, you have to assemble it differently every time.<br/>
Perhaps this could be compared to the difference between English and Math.<br/>
If you want to make flames, normal magic just has you reading out the words for fire.<br/>
However, each level of fire has a different word. You need to remember what to use for blaze, inferno and hellfire.<br/>
However, using the Dragon Pulse, you have to figure out what = Fire.<br/>
Along the way, you can calculate Fire + Oil = blaze, or inferno + water = blaze.<br/>
Taniko can borrow the earth’s power and still make fire. From Earth + Darkness, she somehow solves for the Darkness, and converts that to flame.<br/>
That’s why obstructing the magic may prove simple.<br/>
By taking in the variables, and reasoning what the enemy is going to solve for, you can derive it first.<br/>
I can also see why it proves effective with choral magic.<br/>
Even if you don’t solve a puzzle alone, as long as it’s solved, it’s solved.<br/>
I see why these two types are incompatible with one another.<br/>
However close the theory may be, like oil and water, their compatibility is terrible.<br/>
But SP is the link that connects these two worlds.<br/>
… That means that only heroes have the ability to mix them.<br/>
Okay, let’s release this power.<br/>
「Revelation Aura」!<br/>
(TL: I’m not sure if it’s liberation of revelation. The higher level is testament, so I’m leaning towards Revelation. Also http://batspi.com/index.php?%E3%83%AA%E3%83%99%E3%83%AC%E3%82%A4%E3%82%B7%E3%83%A7%E3%83%B3%E3%82%AA%E3%83%BC%E3%83%A9)<br/>
Revelation… is it a level above Dreifach?<br/>
The words come naturally out of my mouth.<br/>
Now then, who should be my guinea pig?<br/>
I’ll try casting it on the sturdy Firo.<br/>
"Firo, stay still for a bit." (Naofumi)<br/>
"Eh…" (Firo)<br/>
Firo’s face shows blatant discontent.<br/>
What’s with that attitude?<br/>
"Whenever master says something like that, nothing good happens." (Firo)<br/>
Ah, I get that feeling too.<br/>
Especially for Firo. Those are the words I used when she had the Monster Crest carved on her.<br/>
The Firo of that time was shaking. Did she get a trauma?<br/>
If that’s the case, I guess I can understand why she would hate it.<br/>
"Well that’s true, but it won’t really hurt this time. I think. So just become my test subject." (Naofumi)<br/>
"No…" (Firo)<br/>
I hear Firo complaining, but I forcibly cast it on her anyways.<br/>
I really am a devil.<br/>
But it’s support magic, so it shouldn’t hurt.<br/>
Anyways, the magic eventually comes into contact with Firo.<br/>
The visibly dense mass of magic envelops Firo, and permeates into her skin.<br/>
Gu… My magic and SP’s been drained clean.<br/>
That’s just how much it cost.<br/>
"W-what did you cast?" (Firo)<br/>
"I used it before, right? It’s the spell Aura, which increases all stats. I think it’s a higher level this time." (Naofumi)<br/>
"Is that so?" (Firo)<br/>
"Yeah, so try jumping." (Naofumi)<br/>
"Okay." (Firo)<br/>
Firo tries to jump lightly while flapping her wings.<br/>
But…<br/>
"Wa-" (Firo)<br/>
With amazing force, she sends herself flying towards the ocean.<br/>
It was as if a rocket had been launched.<br/>
"Ah…" (Naofumi)<br/>
Yeah. For now, let’s check Firo’s status.<br/>
Uwah, this is amazing. Every single stat has more than doubled.<br/>
I guess moving with this status would cause her to blast off.<br/>
I chased Firo with Atlas.<br/>
"Ahahaha~! Master, this is fun!" (Firo)<br/>
With a rumbling sound, Firo is… running on top of the ocean.<br/>
Wow… before one foot sinks, she’s already put her weight on the other one.<br/>
No matter how amazing she was, even Firo was unable to run on the ocean before.<br/>
So this is the power of my magic.<br/>
After about 10 minutes, the effects of Revelation Aura wore off, and Firo sunk.<br/>
She swam back to shore.<br/>
"That was fun, Master. Do it again~." (Firo)<br/>
"Rejected." (Naofumi)<br/>
That was ridiculously difficult! There’s no way I could use it continuously.<br/>
But with this, I’ve understood the theory behind the magic.<br/>
Perhaps Mussou Kassei artificially creates something similar to SP.<br/>
When that’s in place, Magic increases in effectiveness.<br/>
But without SP, Magic has its limits.<br/>
That means Hengen Musou may have been created in an attempt to become closer to the heroes.<br/>
Anyways, I should tell the Magic Shopkeeper about this.<br/>
Even if Revelation is impossible, I think I could use it to do a Dreifach Heal.<br/>
I can use it to reconstruct a magic that I already know to find another answer.<br/>
And if I just remember the chant that comes out, my life will be easier.<br/>
I never thought I would be able to master magic by studying Chi.<br/>
With this, I can get a discount on my payments to the Magic Shop.<br/>
