<br/>
Griffons.<br/>
In the fantasy world, they might be the most famous following after dragons.<br/>
A monster whose upper half is an eagle, and lower half is a lion. Something that most people already know.<br/>
I love the griffons that appear in RPG games quite a lot.<br/>
They normally appear around the middle part of the game as powerful enemies.<br/>
I haven’t seen any games with griffons as their last boss, but pretty often as middle stage bosses as tough encounters. <br/>
Most of all, they are cool.<br/>
You know…it shouldn’t be something that shows early game all of a sudden.<br/>
I have to prepare my heart, Griffon-san.<br/>
A famous monster in fantasy games is coming at top speed towards us.<br/>
I could hear the sound of the wind hitting its giant wings and its beastly cry.<br/>
"Big…" (Makoto)<br/>
The Griffon is 2 sizes bigger than the Rampaging Bison.<br/>
The scythe-like claws at its thick front legs were shining.<br/>
It feels as if it could cut a human like a piece of cloth.<br/>
"Everyone, get away! Its aim is probably the meat of the Rampaging Bison", Jean shouts.<br/>
The Griffon must have been lured by the roasted smell of meat.<br/>
Jean was pulling the hand of Emily.<br/>
"Lucy, let’s run." (Makoto)<br/>
"But the monster we did our hardest to defeat…" (Lucy)<br/>
"This isn’t the time to be saying that! There’s no way we can fight a danger level high!" (Makoto)<br/>
The ogre the other day was cute in comparison to this.<br/>
The giant eagle wings were creating gusts of wind, and I could feel it even from here.<br/>
The Griffon stopped at the Rampaging Bison as we thought.<br/>
It began to eat the meat just like that.<br/>
"Aah, our spoils…" (Lucy)<br/>
I heard Lucy, but I ignored her.<br/>
What are you worrying about at this kind of time? <br/>
We take distance stealthily so that we don’t catch the attention of the Griffon.<br/>
(Please, we will give you what we hunted, so please just leave after.) (Makoto)<br/>
I prayed for this, but the Griffon glares this way.<br/>
Its gaze was directed at…Lucy, huh.<br/>
"Huh?" (Lucy)<br/>
Lucy let out a dumbfounded voice.<br/>
Oi oi, she is so unlucky.<br/>
This is the 2nd time today.<br/>
"Lucy, you are pretty popular today." (Makoto)<br/>
"Wait, no way!" (Lucy)<br/>
Lucy takes a step back with a stiffened face.<br/>
I wonder why this is.<br/>
I have heard about monsters liking prey with high mana, so maybe they are attracted to the mana of Lucy?<br/>
I should think about that later.<br/>
First, we run!<br/>
"Jean!" (Makoto)<br/>
"Got it. Makoto and I will buy time." (Jean)<br/>
"Wait! That’s impossible. You are going to die!" (Emily)<br/>
Emily was on the verge of tears.<br/>
The Griffon flaps its wings and raises to the sky.<br/>
"It is coming!" (Makoto)<br/>
It began to glide towards Lucy and I.<br/>
[Evade]!<br/>
I wrap my arms around Lucy and activate the skill.<br/>
We managed to avoid the Griffon’s claws by a hair’s breadth.<br/>
*Flap Flap* <br/>
The Griffon once again rises into the sky and looks at us.<br/>
"It is coming again!" (Makoto)<br/>
So stubborn. [Evade]!<br/>
"Guh!" (Lucy)<br/>
It seems like the leg of Lucy hit the ground at the time of the evasion.<br/>
My proficiency with [Evade] is too low to activate with two people still, huh.<br/>
"Lucy, can you chant while I evade?" (Makoto)<br/>
"I will try, but it will probably not be possible…" (Lucy)<br/>
Lucy tells me with tears in her eyes.<br/>
"Right…" (Makoto)<br/>
She needs more than 1 minute in a situation where she can concentrate after all. Chanting while avoiding would be difficult. <br/>
The Griffon attacked us a third time.<br/>
Agh, damn it! [Evade]!<br/>
"Ouch ouch." (Makoto)<br/>
I somehow managed to avoid it, but I scraped my shoulder a bit.<br/>
The aim is becoming sharper and sharper. <br/>
The Griffon immediately returns to the sky.<br/>
This is bad.<br/>
Physical attacks are sealed.<br/>
Jean had his sword in hand with Emily at his back.<br/>
But it looks like he is looking for the timing to switch to attack.<br/>
What?<br/>
Mana is gathering around the Griffon?<br/>
The Griffon is preparing for its fourth attack.<br/>
I have a bad feeling about this, but I have no choice but to avoid it.<br/>
[Evade]! <br/>
I feel an impact in my body.<br/>
"Gaha?!" (Makoto)<br/>
"Kya!" (Lucy)<br/>
Even though I should have avoided that one, I was blown away. <br/>
Lucy is sent flying in a different direction.<br/>
Damn it, that just now was wind magic?<br/>
Wind was covering the surroundings of the Griffon.<br/>
Monsters can use magic?! <br/>
"Are you okay, Makoto, Lucy?!" (Jean)<br/>
"Y-Yeah. Jean, I leave Lucy to you." (Makoto)<br/>
I endure the dizziness and stand up.<br/>
The Griffon slowly approaches Lucy.<br/>
Jean stands in front of it with his sword.<br/>
Lucy doesn’t seem to have lost consciousness, but can’t stand up.<br/>
Emily is chanting healing magic from a far away distance.<br/>
She is in danger too.<br/>
The Griffon had enough intelligence to even use magic.<br/>
When it learns that there’s someone who can use healing magic, I feel like it will aim for her.<br/>
"Damn it!", Jean shouts with uneasiness. <br/>
Each time the Griffon swipes its fore foot, Jean’s shield looks like it would be sent flying.<br/>
It is a matter of time before they are defeated at this rate.<br/>
My mana is completely empty.<br/>
Attacks using my dagger have way too many issues to work.<br/>
I want us to run away if possible, but I don’t think it will let all 4 of us escape.<br/>
What to do? <br/>
Abandon Lucy and run away?<br/>
No, no way.<br/>
(How about abandoning them?) (Noah)<br/>
Noah-sama, shut up please.<br/>
I raise the potency of [Clear Mind] and somehow manage to keep calm, pushing my gears to think of a plan.<br/>
Is there something…<br/>
Remember…<br/>
Something that can defeat that thing…<br/>
<br/>
Chapter 14<br/>
<br/>
"Now then, everyone, the first step to learning magic is feeling the mana." <br/>
This is a story of when I was learning in the Water Temple.<br/>
"Place both hands to the front, and repeat after me. Gods who art in heaven…" <br/>
"""""Gods who art in heaven…"""""<br/>
(I-Is this what they call a magic chant?) <br/>
As a high school student, this is pretty embarrassing. <br/>
But it seems like chanting to use magic is common in this world.<br/>
Endure it.<br/>
"How is it? Did you feel the mana?" <br/>
"Not really…" (Makoto)<br/>
The children around were shouting things like ‘it felt hot’ or ‘it shone!’, and were merry there, but I didn’t feel anything.<br/>
Eh? Isn’t this bad?<br/>
Could it be that I will lose to even children?<br/>
The pale faced teacher came to me.<br/>
"Makoto-kun, this probably can’t be helped since you are already old for this. Children are more sensitive to this kind of thing." <br/>
"Really…?" (Makoto)<br/>
"Please don’t make such an uneasy expression. Let’s do this together." <br/>
Saying this, she grabbed my arm.<br/>
"Please concentrate on your palm." <br/>
"O-Okay." (Makoto)<br/>
There was a somewhat cold sensation in my palm.<br/>
T-This is…?! <br/>
"How is it, Makoto-kun?" <br/>
"I somewhat felt it." (Makoto)<br/>
"I synchronized with you just now, Makoto-kun. It is the ability to interfere with the mana between mages by touching them." <br/>
"So something like that can be done." (Makoto)<br/>
"All mages High Grade and above can do it. There’s a lot of cases where High Grade mages take disciples after all. This is the fastest way to teach someone the way to use magic." <br/>
"Will I be able to use it one day?" (Makoto)<br/>
"You can once your proficiency in magic is over High Grade level. But it won’t go well unless you have an affinity to the element, so please be careful." <br/>
"Were you able to sync with me because you can use water magic too, teacher?" (Makoto)<br/>
"Right, I can use all 6 elements aside from Moon." <br/>
This teacher is pretty amazing…<br/>
That’s the conversation I remembered.<br/>
And so, thanks to using water magic a whole lot, my proficiency level has reached High Grade level, that’s what my teacher told me.<br/>
◇◇<br/>
 I run to where Jean and Lucy are.<br/>
"Jean! Buy me some time please! I am going to use a big spell!" (Makoto)<br/>
"G-Got it!" (Jean)<br/>
Jean throws away his sword and takes a stance with his shield, holding ground with both of his legs.<br/>
The Griffon’s leg attacks Jean.<br/>
He is somehow managing to endure it.<br/>
I am counting on you, Jean.<br/>
"Lucy, raise your mana." (Makoto)<br/>
"Eh?! Wa?" (Lucy)<br/>
"Push your right hand out, form something with you mana for now! I will do the controlling!" (Makoto)<br/>
"Something, you say. I can only use Fire Magic, you know?!" (Lucy)<br/>
"Then use fire. Go all out!" (Makoto)<br/>
I grab the right hand of Lucy, and wrap my other one to her waist.<br/>
Just like the time with the teacher.<br/>
"Hiya! W-Where are you touching?!" (Lucy)<br/>
"Just hurry!" (Makoto)<br/>
"Eeh?! I got it, so don’t stick so close." (Lucy)<br/>
(Something like this?) (Makoto)<br/>
Instead of the usual sensation of gathering mana in my body, imagine becoming one with the body of Lucy to gather mana.<br/>
Sync with the mana of Lucy.<br/>
It is apparently not possible unless you have affinity with the element, but there’s no other way.<br/>
If we can’t, then we are Griffon food.<br/>
I felt as if I was being swallowed by a storm.<br/>
And then, I noticed that this was coming from the inside of Lucy’s body.<br/>
(This is the mana of Lucy, huh.) (Makoto)<br/>
"Hngh!" (Lucy)<br/>
Lucy was letting out a lewd-sounding voice, but I don’t have the leeway to mind it.<br/>
This is different from the small amount of mana I have, this is a massive amount of mana like a storm.<br/>
So this is the mana of a Monarch Grade, huh.<br/>
Lucy was trying to control something like this all the time?<br/>
This is rough.<br/>
I should be a bit kinder when training her.<br/>
Lucy is still raising her magic. <br/>
I try to change to a different from usual fire spell.<br/>
A choice suddenly appeared in front of me.<br/>
Oi! What is it at this busy time?<br/>
[Will you use synchronization magic with Lucy?]<br/>
Yes ←<br/>
No<br/>
Of course yes.<br/>
[Really?]<br/>
Yes ←<br/>
Now that I think about it, no<br/>
…It is coming at me pretty persistently.<br/>
I don’t have any other plan.<br/>
I have no choice but to.<br/>
I gather the massive amount of mana flowing from Lucy into my right hand.<br/>
"[Firestorm]!" (Makoto)<br/>
A giant fire tornado appeared in front of us.<br/>
"Incredible, it activated! Moreover, High Grade Magic!" (Lucy)<br/>
"I feel like it will go berserk if I let my guard down…though…!" (Makoto)<br/>
I feel as if I am pedalling a bicycle at full speed inside a typhoon.<br/>
Sweat is coming out nonstop.<br/>
My body is hot! <br/>
As if it were burning.<br/>
"Jean! Get away!" (Makoto)<br/>
"Alright!" (Jean)<br/>
Jean takes cover close to where Emily is.<br/>
‘Grrrr’, the Griffon growls and moves back as if it were cautious.<br/>
"Aah, it is going to avoid it!" (Emily)<br/>
Emily screams.<br/>
The Firestorm is not gonna reach the Griffon.<br/>
The Griffon evades into the sky.<br/>
"Oi! Makoto, what are we gonna do?!" (Jean)<br/>
The Firestorm is about to pass by the side of the Griffon.<br/>
(Picture it. Just like water. The Griffon has its guard down. If it is now, we can hit it.) (Makoto)<br/>
"Spread!" (Makoto)<br/>
The fire tornado changes into a big whirl in an instant.<br/>
The heat reached all the way here.<br/>
‘Giieeeeee!’, the Griffon gets swallowed by the fire.<br/>
"Eeeeeh?! You changed the Firestorm while it was activated?!" (Lucy)<br/>
"I have been training so that I can do this someday." (Makoto)<br/>
I wasn’t expecting a spell this wide scale though.<br/>
The Griffon struggles to escape from the fire, but the fire pillar chases after it. <br/>
"As if I will let you." (Makoto)<br/>
I am beginning to get used to the storm-like mana of Lucy.<br/>
(It really is hot though. It also smells like something is burning.) (Makoto)<br/>
My whole body feels prickly.<br/>
I have stopped sweating?<br/>
"W-Wait, Makoto!" (Lucy)<br/>
"Oi, you are burning!" (Jean)<br/>
"Eh?" (Makoto)<br/>
I couldn’t see well with the Firestorm, but my body is burning? <br/>
"What’s this?" (Makoto)<br/>
"Makoto! Stop the magic! Anymore than this is bad!" (Lucy)<br/>
Lucy is getting worried.<br/>
"Are you okay, Lucy?" (Makoto)<br/>
"I am okay! Anyways, stop the spell!" (Lucy)<br/>
[Release].<br/>
I stop the spell.<br/>
"Eh? The fire around me isn’t disappearing." (Makoto)<br/>
"Why are you so calm?! You are burning, you know?!" (Lucy)<br/>
"Aah, yeah." (Makoto)<br/>
Even if you tell me that, Clear Mind makes it so that I don’t panic though.<br/>
It really is a handy skill.<br/>
"The Griffon is falling!" (Emily)<br/>
The Griffon falls flat at the place Emily pointed.<br/>
Its wings are burned, and parts here and there of its body are carbonized. <br/>
It is severely wounded.<br/>
"Jean, go!" (Makoto)<br/>
"Leave it to me! Or more like, extinguish yourself!" (Jean)<br/>
The sword Jean is holding shines.<br/>
"[Max Output, Wind Blade]!" (Jean)<br/>
The sword of Jean is covered in green light, and beheads the Griffon.<br/>
"D-Did we do it?" (Jean)<br/>
Jean collapses lethargic. <br/>
Lucy is swaying by my side.<br/>
I must have sucked way too much mana from her all of a sudden.<br/>
"Amazing, amazing! Jean, we defeated a Griffon!" (Emily)<br/>
Emily was hugging Jean.<br/>
"Haaah, what a relief." (Makoto)<br/>
The relief of defeating the Griffon undid Clear Mind.<br/>
Honestly speaking, I wasn’t careful.<br/>
I am relying way too much on Clear Mind.<br/>
It looks like the ‘that feels hot’ I thought of before was actually severe.<br/>
"Aaah…!!" (Makoto)<br/>
Pain attacks my whole body. <br/>
My vision gets narrower and narrower. <br/>
"Ma-Makoto!" (Lucy)<br/>
My vision gets darker while I listen to the voice of Lucy.<br/>
No good.<br/>
I can’t keep my consciousness.<br/>
Synchronization magic with Lucy…<br/>
Even when it was in actual combat, we splendidly managed to defeat the Griffon which we thought was despairingly grim.<br/>
It is quite the strong attack method for bronze ranks like us.<br/>
But in exchange, due to not having magic affinity, I apparently got burned by the mana of Lucy.<br/>
So that’s what it meant when she told me that I can’t do it unless I have the affinity.<br/>
I should have asked the teacher what would happen…<br/>
This method is no good anymore.<br/>
I thought it would work well though…<br/>
…The world went dark.<br/>
