Chapter 54.3 : Rescue Mission<br/>
◆Freedom Fighter Girl, Shizufae<br/>
「HA! !」<br/>
I swung the wooden sword at Novis.<br/>
「Woops! ! 」<br/>
But he parried my attack with his sword.<br/>
「HEYA! ! !」<br/>
Big Sis Keyna swung her pole, aiming for Novis’ side. But Novis easily dodged that swipe by jumping away.<br/>
Both of us leaping back, opening some distance between us and Novis.<br/>
As expected of the person known as the Hero of Fire. Even the two of us together were no match against him.<br/>
「Let’s stop…」<br/>
Novis relaxed his stance.<br/>
「Eh, what’s the matter, Novis? 」<br/>
「It’s not enough. I won’t improve if my training opponent is Shizufae…」<br/>
「What did you say?! You’re the one who asked me to spar with you!」<br/>
「 I mean, It can’t be helped, you know. I’m not close to any other swordsman other than Shizufae. Moreover, I’ll come out unscathed in spar against you anyway, so I don’t even feel the need to go all out. This doesn’t even count as training.」<br/>
Though Novis said those words with disappointed voice, there’s nothing I can do to made him change his mind.<br/>
Novis spoke in a disappointed voice. Nothing I could do now would change his mind.<br/>
「 Geez, even if you say that now, you knew that I wasn’t a match for you from the very beginning. So why did you suddenly ask me and Big Sis Keyna to spar with you?」<br/>
I’m curious. This has never happened before. All of a sudden, Novis wants to become stronger? What’s with that?<br/>
However, Novis refused to answer my question.<br/>
「That’s because he saw the hero of light.」<br/>
「Big sis Keyna!」<br/>
Big Sis Keyna laughed as she hugged Novis from behind.<br/>
I let out a sigh upon hearing his reason. Looks like he still considers Reiji-sama to be his rival. But, no matter what, I can’t imagine him winning against Reiji-sama. However, it’s still a good thing that he wants to become stronger.<br/>
Even Madi felt the need to work harder after she saw Black Haired Sage-sama. That’s why she went to the Sorcerer’s association in Ariadya.<br/>
Currently, we were sparring in the rear garden of the Ishtar Temple. The garden was only supposed to be used by the shrine maidens of Ishtar sama, the goddess of love and beauty, to hang their laundry. However, since I completed a lot of requests from the Ishtar temple, I get along well with the shrine maidens. So I’m allowed to use this place.<br/>
The shrine maidens of Ishtar temple are extremely open-minded. They warmly accepted me, a follower of Faeria. If someone who followed another faith visited the Faeria temple, they would urge them to convert to their faith.<br/>
It’s rumoured that Faeria and Ishtar’s followers are on bad terms with each other. But I know the truth. It’s just the Faeria’s followers’ unjustified hatred towards Ishtar’s followers. The reason lies in the difference in the two faith’s teachings. Faeria’s faith taught that one should only give their chastity to their husband, who in Faeria-sama’s case is the God King Oudith-sama.<br/>
On the contrary, Ishtar-sama, goddess of beauty, was the lover of several male gods. In short, their teachings contradict each other. Thus, Faeria’s followers hate Ishtar’s followers.<br/>
But, I don’t give a damn about their hatred, even if I myself am Faeria’s follower. Moreover, unlike Republic Ariadya, the freedom city Teseshia was the heart of Ishtar’s faith. Antagonizing the followers in their own city is a bad idea anyway.<br/>
Keeping aside their doctrine, the shrine maidens were nice and easygoing. I came to this city when I was a child and have been indebted to them since then. That’s why, I have no right to comment on them.<br/>
I mean, aside from me, even Big Sis Keyna and Novis get along with the shrine maidens. Although, Novis seems to have hit it off with them too well. Some of the shrine maidens were obviously intending to approach Novis romantically. After all, even though he’s nothing in front of Reiji-sama, Novis is still an amazing man.<br/>
「 Ha~ Don’t you think you should start by looking for a proper teacher first? 」<br/>
Novis shook his head upon hearing my words.<br/>
「I tried that option long ago. But ever since I fought with my previous swordsmanship teacher, every single training place has rejected me.」<br/>
「Come to think of it, something like that did happen, huh? How about looking for a teacher in this city then?」<br/>
A long time ago, Novis destroyed a swordsmanship training place. That place didn’t suit Novis’ personality, but because of that, every other training place refused to train Novis.<br/>
「 You should try asking the hero of light to teach you, young man. He’s strong, so it won’t be a problem if you go all out against him.」<br/>
I looked towards the direction of the voice and found Nora-san approaching us.<br/>
「Please stop calling me that, Nora-san. I’m not a young man anymore.」<br/>
「Ah, my bad. I forget how fast a human grows in such a short time.」<br/>
And from Nora-san perspective, all human were children. I have no clue how old Nora-san is. She’s probably well over hundred years old. From Nora-san’s perspective, all humans are children.<br/>
「 Novis, I think Nora-san’s advice is great.」<br/>
But, even if Reiji-sama’s strong, whether or not he’d be willing to teach Novis was another matter. Well, it would be better than having Novis spar against us all the time.<br/>
「You’re right. But somehow, it just feels…」<br/>
Novis seemed reluctant.<br/>
「Well, you aren’t willing to ask the hero of light, right? How about asking the Maiden of Sword to teach you?」<br/>
Big Sis Keyna grinned as she suggested that.<br/>
. I don’t know why, but I think Big Sis Keyna hates Reiji-sama.<br/>
「The Maiden of Sword? Who in the hell is that, Big Sis Keyna? 」<br/>
「 What?! I can’t believe you don’t know about her, Novis! She’s the hero of light’s comrade, you know? I heard that her swordsmanship is better than the hero of light’s.」<br/>
「Is that true, Big Sis Keyna?!」<br/>
Novis yelled.<br/>
Come to think of it, Chiyuki-sama told me about this. Other than the girl who dove into the labyrinth back then, there was another girl called Maiden of Sword in their party. If I’m not wrong… Her name’s Shirone. Her swordsmanship is known to resemble a dance. Last I heard, she was on the move by herself. I think she should be in the northern lands right now.<br/>
「 But… What will you do to get her to teach you? Right now, she’s in a distant place, you know?」<br/>
「Ah, Shizufae, I heard she was in this region. It seems that Leylia personally met the Maiden of Sword.」<br/>
「Eh, seriously?! 」<br/>
I was told that Leylia-san went to Rena’s temple in Republic Ariadya for religious reasons. I didn’t get the chance to ask why she needed to visit the temple, but I never thought that she was summoned by the Maiden of Sword.<br/>
「I see, so the Maiden of Sword is in this region, huh? She must be a beauty, right? Ehehe~」<br/>
Novis’ worldly desire was evident.<br/>
Good grief, what the hell are you thinking about, Novis? It’s extremely vexing. Well, I don’t think Novis stands a chance because of Reiji-sama anyway. But there’s one thing I’m worried about. Just what kind of a person is the Maiden of Sword? I wanted to take swordsmanship lessons from her too. I wanted to become stronger, being weak was absolutely miserable.<br/>
The Maiden of Sword Shirone-sama… I wanted to meet her.<br/>
「NOVI\~S! ! 」<br/>
A familiar voice called out to Novis. It was our old acquaintance!<br/>
「「Justy! ! 」」<br/>
Novis and I called out her name.<br/>
Justya. Justy for short. She’s our childhoof friend and the shrine maiden of Ishtar-sama. Since we’re of the same age, we became acquainted after I came to this place. We used to play together with Madi and Novis.<br/>
Justine made a beeline towards us.<br/>
「You should’ve told me you were back the moment you returned from your mission, Novis!」<br/>
She hugged Novis tightly. It seems she hadn’t met him after he returned from his mission in the north.<br/>
「GUFUU! ! 」<br/>
It seemed like Novis was in pain.<br/>
Justy’s quite chubby and her raw power is enought to make a man lose his face in front of her. That’s why Novis was in pain instead of being delighted about being hugged by a woman.<br/>
In fact, Justy is Godan, the hero of earth’s, little sister. We got to know about this matter only a few days ago. I was extremely surprised when I first heard it. Although, I couldn’t deny it since she resembles her brother so much.<br/>
「Oh my, Shizufae. You’re here too? 」<br/>
Justy asked as she kept clinging onto Novis. She’s always had a thing for him and for some reason, she assumed I was her rival in love. That made her hostile towards me. But something like that is impossible.<br/>
Keeping the matter of her hostility aside, I’m not pleased to hear that she didn’t notice me despite the fact that I was standing right next to Novis.<br/>
「 You didn’t realize I was here the whole time, Justy? Ah, my bad! My body isn’t as big as yours, after all.」<br/>
I smiled as I subtly glanced at her stomach.<br/>
「That’s right, Shizufae. Since your breasts are so small, I could barely see you!」<br/>
「HAAAH! !」<br/>
My breasts definitely aren’t small. They’re at least bigger than Madi’s or Nora-san’s. On the other hand, Justy was just oversized!<br/>
It’s not like I’m annoyed by that though, since her body itself was oversized. I’m just vexed about her comment…<br/>
「What are you so proud about?! Yours are just a lump of fat!」<br/>
「I’m not fat! I’m just chubbier than the average girl!」<br/>
Justy and I glared at each other.<br/>
「Wait! Please wait! YOU GUYS ARE KILLING NOVIS!!」<br/>
Big Sis Keyna suddenly interrupted our quarrel. Upon a closer look, Novis, who was still in Justy’s embrace, had started foaming at his mouth.<br/>
「KYAAA――――NOVIIIS!!」<br/>
Justy immediately released him from her bear hug and shook him by his shoulders in an attempt to wake him up.<br/>
Justy… You’re too awesome. You almost strangled the hero of fire to death.<br/>
