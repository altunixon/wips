Vandalieu<br/>
<br/>
The protagonist who is approximately two months away from turning eight years old at the end of volume 4. Now that he has acquired dairy products, he has hopes for the future that he will grow taller.<br/>
He has realized that he has lost the resistance to solitude that he had developed on Earth, but now he is capable of equipping insects and plants within his body and is constantly followed around by Princess Levia and the other Ghosts who can become invisible, so he does not feel lonely at all.<br/>
He fears gods as he believes that they are beings that are absolutely superior to him, but that is because of the experience of great failure carved into his mind when he could not strike a single blow back at Rodcorte after dying in Origin. As for the fact that he destroyed the Spirit Clone of the god of ice Yupeon that resided in Ice Age, he does not think anything more of it other than, “It was nothing more than a Spirit Clone.”<br/>
In addition, he is unaware that the pseudo-reincarnations that he is conducting is causing damage to Rodcorte. As Alda and Fitun are also gods, he knows nothing of their movements other than the fact that they are hostile to him.<br/>
He does not think much of the fact that he destroyed Kaidou Kanata, the first reincarnated individual that he encountered in Lambda. However, he does think that things will be troublesome once other reincarnated individuals arrive. But as he has no way to prevent their arrival, he believes that he should just take care and prepare as much as he can, just as he has been doing up until now.<br/>
After Heinz and his party defeated Ternecia, the Lemures who were watching them ran out of Mana, so he did not monitor them after that. Thus, he is unaware of the fact that Heinz was promoted to S-class or the fact that he gained the status of honorary nobleman that Vandalieu has been aiming for.<br/>
Vandalieu has succeeded in refining new metals, eliminating Ternecia and attracted new citizens to Talosheim.<br/>
Talosheim’s current population exceeds four thousand, so it is still considered a small city-state in Lambda, but its infrastructure is as complete as any great nation’s capital.<br/>
But Vandalieu himself isn’t aware of this and works like a workaholic; he does not seem to have the sense that he is living luxuriously.<br/>
During the fourth volume, he was stared in the eyes by the reality that the Orbaume Kingdom he had so many expectations for was not a dream-like country but simply another nation, so those expectations rapidly vanished.<br/>
His eyes have been opened to the Hartner Duchy in particular; even if the Amid Empire was to invade it, Vandalieu would do nothing about it; if there wasn’t an S-class adventurer in the Hartner Duchy, he would consider trampling over the Empire’s army from their flank when both sides were exhausted.<br/>
He is currently planning to start cultivating a marshland to the south in order to produce more Capricorns and increase production of milk products.<br/>
He rapidly became more unworldly in the past volume, but he doesn’t really mind.<br/>
In terms of power, if he fights while being careful not to stand out to others, he is in the lower to middle area of C-class.<br/>
If he uses Insect Binding Technique, Plant Binding Technique, his tongue and threads, Dead Spirit Magic and reveals how much of a ‘Monstrosity’ he is, he is between the upper area of A-class to S-class.<br/>
And if he uses the Demon King’s fragments and fights without holding anything back, he is truly as powerful as an S-class adventurer.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Eleanora<br/>
<br/>
She studied combat diligently in order to be of use to Vandalieu, so her magic-related skills have not developed.<br/>
But while she is by his side as a servant, she looks more and more like his guardian. She feels apologetic to Darcia every time she is mistakenly assumed to be Vandalieu’s mother, and she feels angry, thinking, “I don’t want to become a mother! I haven’t even had any experience!” She also feels depressed, wondering, “Do I really look that old?”<br/>
Her master is rapidly becoming more otherworldly, but she acknowledged Vandalieu as the most fearsome master in the world right at the beginning; she does not feel a renewed fear of him.<br/>
While she feels a sense of closeness with Vandalieu’s new servant, Bellmond, she also feels a burning sense of rivalry.<br/>
She turned five people from the First Cultivation Village including the chief’s son, Sebas, into Subordinate Vampires, but she has never actually had any subordinates of her own before except for Isla and the other Vampire Zombies, so she is troubled as to how to treat them.<br/>
Thus, she has currently told them to first undergo a Job-change and become Rank 5 and is now leaving them be.<br/>
She has polished her skills in swordsmanship and undergone a Job-change, so she has become a little stronger than she was in the third volume.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Braga<br/>
<br/>
From being single, he has now married Marie and the former prostitute Linda, joining the ranks of the successful in life. In addition, their wedding ceremony was held at a time of year known on Earth as Christmas.<br/>
He has been unexpectedly careful with his family planning; he has already discussed with his wives that once they have a child, they should wait for that child to reach Rank 4 before having another.<br/>
Black Goblins have a starting Rank of 2, so they lack the strength they need to make a living by hunting in Talosheim.<br/>
Braga is currently spending fulfilling nights with his family while polishing his skills so that he can teach his children his specialized killing techniques once they are born.<br/>

Kasim<br/>
<br/>
An adventurer, a former refugee who fled the Sauron Duchy, and a former villager of the Seventh Cultivation Village. He was promoted to D-class, but that qualification has now been invalidated.<br/>
He formed a party with other boys from the same cultivation village of the same age as him, and he is the Shield-bearer and leader of the party.<br/>
Incidentally, if one asks why he aspires to become a Shield-bearer, the answer is that he was moved by an old hero’s tale he once heard, and that hero was known as the person who first invented Shield Bash.<br/>
That hero’s name has been left in history as the one who invented offensive martial skills at a time when all other Shield-bearer martial skills were for defense and provoking.<br/>
Kasim has dreamed of being like that hero. Perhaps because of this dream, he sometimes attacks with his shield while shouting, “Shield Bash,” despite not being able to use the martial skill.<br/>
He is currently in his growth phase, so Vandalieu feels an unstoppable envy for his wonderful body that becomes more robust by the day.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
(adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({});<br/>
<br/>
However, Kasim feels an unstoppable envy for Vandalieu, who possesses a harem.<br/>
Incidentally, his family was a farming family.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Zeno<br/>
<br/>
An adventurer, a former refugee who fled the Sauron Duchy, and a former villager of the Seventh Cultivation Village. His qualification as an adventurer has now been invalidated.<br/>
He formed a party with other boys from the same cultivation village of the same age as him, and he is the Scout and second leader of the party.<br/>
Because he has always been small, agile and bad at physical labor, he decided that he would be a Scout when he became an adventurer.<br/>
It seems that he had an aptitude for it, partially because of his calm personality.<br/>
He is frequently dragged along by Fester’s antics; it is a common pattern for him and Kasim to stop Fester together.<br/>
In truth, he was quite cautious of Vandalieu when he first met him. But he began treating Vandalieu normally once he saw his behavior and realized that he was a child despite being expressionless… though he was taken aback to realize that Vandalieu was the king of the place that he was about to migrate to.<br/>
Since tasting Talosheim’s delicious food, he realized that he is quite the gluttonous character.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Fester<br/>
<br/>
An adventurer, a former refugee who fled the Sauron Duchy, and a former villager of the Seventh Cultivation Village. His qualification as an adventurer has now been invalidated.<br/>
He formed a party with other boys from the same cultivation village of the same age as him, and he acts as the frontline for the party and keeps the party’s mood up.<br/>
He is the type of person who gets easily carried away, and is in love with Lina, who is the poster girl of the jack-of-all-trades store and the sole employee of the Adventurers’ Guild branch.<br/>
One might think that he treated Vandalieu like a very normal child, but he has an unexpectedly sharp, flexible mindset that led him to asking Vandalieu for training and advice on how to prepare to kill someone.<br/>
His ability is growing rapidly and his relationship with Lina is progressing as well. It is possible that he has the elements of a protagonist.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Daene<br/>
<br/>
Also known as the apple lady.<br/>
She was a middle-aged woman who raised her son while making a living selling fruit in the city of Niarki while enduring the abuse from her mother-in-law. Just when her son married a woman and Daene thought it would be her turn, the couple eloped. One could feel sympathy for her situation, but she reaped what she sowed.<br/>
She stole money from Vandalieu, saying that the coin he gave her was fake, and when he fled the Adventurers’ Guild and left the city, she tried to capture him and sell him off, only to die in madness through his Scream and Mind Encroachment.<br/>
After that, she turned into an Undead and fought Heinz and his party and showed wonderful effort by becoming the core of a Zombie Giant.<br/>
After that, she was pseudo-reincarnated as an Ent that Vandalieu found in the Eclipse King’s Orchard, which produces iron-hard apple-like fruits. She is currently equipped inside his body.<br/>
Like Chezare, she is the type of person who is shining more brightly after death.<br/>
However, Vandalieu does not remember what kind of person she was in her previous life.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Levia<br/>
<br/>
Talosheim’s First Princess. Unlike her younger sister, in her previous life, she had meager ability in battle. When the Mirg shield-nation attacked, she escaped to the then-friendly nation, the Hartner Duchy, with her warriors guarding her along with the children and elderly who couldn’t fight.<br/>
After that, she was betrayed and burned at the stake and then her ashes were abandoned in the underground cemetery.<br/>
After that, her feelings of regret turned her into a Ghost and when she was intending to move on to the next life, Vandalieu instigated her. Her Rank increased and she became a Flame Ghost and then a Blaze Ghost after killing Kanata.<br/>
Her existence is necessary for Vandalieu’s Dead Spirit Magic, and currently she is the most prominent of the spirits haunting him with the exception of Darcia.<br/>
She is a beautiful woman with an air of elegance, and has a kind, graceful personality. But because she is a Titan, she also has the trait of not minding smaller details.<br/>
Her skin currently has the same dark color that she had when she was alive, but her hair and clothes are made of flames and below a certain point above her knees, her legs are missing. Her hair and clothes are a part of her, so she can change their shape at will and use them to attack during battle.<br/>
She normally exposes her skin a lot by having her clothes in the form of a leotard in order to save Mana, but the Titans of Talosheim actually prefer highly-exposing clothes other than during cold winters, so there seems to be no deep meaning to this.<br/>
Incidentally, when she was alive, she wore a long, simple piece of cloth (though when examined closely, it had many revealing slits).<br/>
As for her bust size, she reigns supreme among the people of Talosheim in terms of absolute size. However, that is due to the fact that she is a Titan who is over 2.5m tall; in terms of relative size to her body, her bust is not much different to Tarea’s or Basdia’s.<br/>
Thus, as a result of discussion, she has been treated as an exception in the bust rankings of Talosheim, and for some reason, is treated as a special adviser.<br/>

Kaidou Kanata<br/>
<br/>
The second person reincarnated from another world into Lambda. He cleared military training at a fairly exceptional level. He used fire-attribute magic that was considered almost genius-level in Origin, as well as his ordinary wind-attribute magic. He also had the cheat-like ability ‘Gungnir” that allowed penetration through target objects.<br/>
In Origin, where things like sniper rifles and infra-red scopes exist, he possessed the greatest mission success rate among the Bravers.<br/>
He performed much work, such as rescuing injured people during disasters by passing through the rubble to save them.<br/>
However, his personality can only be described as that of a low-life.<br/>
When he was on Earth, he was nothing more than a common high school student who aspired to becoming special, but after being reincarnated in Origin with cheat-like abilities, magic and talent, he was drowned in the feeling of being special.<br/>
In addition, he thought of the people of Origin not as humans like him, but as characters in stories or games. Thinking to enjoy himself more than everyone else, he used his cheat-like ability to stain his hands with crime.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
(adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({});<br/>
<br/>
He performed deeds such as dealing the final blow to Shihouin Mari’s mother when she was wounded and on the verge of death in order to sell her organs. But he simply thought of this as role-playing a villain in a game.<br/>
His sense of life being a game was not cured in his third life; it worsened horribly due to the existence of the Status and skill systems. And as a result of being reincarnated again, his view on life and death become ambiguous as well, so he seriously thought that if things went badly, he would simply need to hit a reset button.<br/>
Before being reincarnated in Lambda, Rodcorte requested him to erase Vandalieu, but Kanata asked to be reincarnated for a fourth life in a world with developed science as a reward.<br/>
But that irresponsible thought became his enemy; because he used his cheat-like ability that needed to be used to kill the enemy the first time they saw it, and committed reckless acts of violence, Vandalieu learned how he fought and disarmed him.<br/>
In the end, he didn’t know that Vandalieu could break souls, so he ended up declaring that he would be back for a rematch, only to have his soul broken to avoid that danger.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Pete<br/>
<br/>
An aggressive centipede monster who was basking in the sun on a tree branch and performed a spectacular dive after being immediately tamed by Vandalieu who passed by underneath.<br/>
He is the number 1 creature that has been equipped through Insect Binding Technique.<br/>
After that, he became an underling of the Cemetery Bees.<br/>
He was Rank 1 to begin with, but as of the end of volume 4, he is a Rank 4 Lance Centipede.<br/>
He has a playful side such as sleeping in Vandalieu’s hair with his head sticking out, but he has become more like his older Cemetery Bee sisters, who are always building their nests and gathering honey and larvae. Pete looks after the other insects that Vandalieu equips… apparently.<br/>
He cannot communicate anything specific other than through the clicking he sounds he makes with his jaws and wings, so nobody other than Vandalieu can understand him.<br/>
Incidentally, he hates water.<br/>

Gopher<br/>
<br/>
One of the daughters of the Sword King Borkus. She is two hundred and thirteen years old, and evacuated to the Hartner Duchy from Talosheim, but she was separated from Princess Levia and her warriors, was told that she would be taken to the place that she would live while taking shelter in the Hartner Duchy and spent two hundred years being forced to work.<br/>
As a result of having received Vandalieu’s age-reversing massage, physically, she is currently about a hundred years old.<br/>
Her personality is that of someone who takes care of others, and when the elderly among the Titan slaves died, she became one of the leaders.<br/>
She gave birth three times in the slave-run mine, but she currently only has two sons. After reuniting with Borkus, her parent-child relationship with him was rekindled, but her father has changed in all kinds of ways and she is now struggling to mediate the relationship between her sons and the grandfather that has suddenly appeared in their lives.<br/>
She admired Levia when she was a child, and had the childish thought of wanting to be like a princess herself, but as a result of the harsh mine work that she was forced to do, she has grown into a strong woman who looks as if she could strangle an ox to death; Vandalieu acknowledges her as having “nice muscles.” In fact, she has experienced strangling Earthworms that emerged from the ground. All of this is the Hartner family’s fault.<br/>
After returning to Talosheim, she didn’t feel like doing any mining for a while and her body was feeling unusually good, so she decided to aim for the broken childhood dream of becoming an adventurer.<br/>

Luciliano<br/>
<br/>
An adventurer around thirty years of age who originally worked in the Mirg shield-nation, but moved to the Orbaume Kingdom to in order to continue his research into the Undead. He was caught up in a noble family’s conspiracy during the conflict over the succession of the Hartner family and turned into a slave.<br/>
He was a C-class adventurer, but that qualification was revoked when he became a slave.<br/>
He was born as the second son in a family of artists, and although he was not gifted with a talent for art, he was blessed with a talent for magic. He intended to make a living using this talent, but he became entranced by research into Undead during his time at the Mages’ Guild.<br/>
After that, he devoted himself to Undead research without breaking the law, but the Mages’ Guild had ethical problems with this so they threw him out and essentially excommunicated him. However, he is sturdier than he looks, capable of working as an adventurer to earn enough money for living expenses and funding his research.<br/>
Incidentally, other than the false charges placed on him when he became a slave, he has never broken the law. He has always skillfully walked around gray areas.<br/>
While he is an adventurer, rather than accepting extermination requests and clearing Dungeons, he often received special requests from people like noblemen to use his life-attribute magic that he is adept with, so he has learned the proper etiquette for dealing with noblemen. At the same time, he has become aware of what a refined lifestyle is like; his tastes have grown so specific that he requested a full-course dinner for his final meal.<br/>
When he encountered Vandalieu earlier, he felt fear and a danger for his life, but after finding out that Vandalieu could use undiscovered magic and tame Undead, he decided to become Vandalieu’s apprentice. Ever since, he has been spending fulfilling days as an assistant in creating Undead while researching whether he can replicate the effects of death-attribute magic with his own life-attribute magic.<br/>
However, he acts self-important despite referring to Vandalieu as “Master.” Vandalieu doesn’t criticize him for this, so this behavior appears to be increasing over time.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Bellmond<br/>
<br/>
A Noble-born Vampire who was ‘Ternecia’s Foolish Dog,’ one of the Five Dogs that were Ternecia’s loyal retainers.<br/>
She originally appeared to be a handsome butler with a monocle, but she turned out to be a female forest-monkey-type Beast-person with Lamia blood mixed in her heritage, her body covered in scars and burns.<br/>
She was saved by Ternecia’s subordinates on the verge of death, and in trying to repay the debt, despite failing several times, she endured the side-effects and became a Noble-born Vampire.<br/>
However, what awaited her was becoming a watchdog of Ternecia’s final hideout and living out tedious days for thousands of years while enduring Ternecia’s outbursts of anger whenever Ternecia visited the hideout and remembered her. During this time, Bellmond realized that she was only a watchdog in title; she was nothing more than something to be consumed in emergencies.<br/>
With her mind in pain, she taught herself the Thread-reeling skill that is almost never used in modern society to manipulate metal strings as weapons and acquired the Thread-user Job; she is full of talent. However, her magical qualities remained poor even after becoming a Noble-born Vampire, perhaps due to having been born as a Beast-person.<br/>
She constantly maintains polite speech and behavior, but she is actually quite the yandere. However, rather than being the type to attack others, she only puts pressure on herself.<br/>
That hasn’t changed after she turned to Vandalieu’s side, but she wants to hold expectations from now on.<br/>
She is an expert of the Thread-reeling skill, even using her tongue in addition to her fingers and toes to manipulate strings, but she was the weakest of the Five Dogs in battle.<br/>
Also, due to her scars and burns, her feminine body parts are missing, so she is lowest in the bust ranking as well.<br/>
However, Vandalieu is intending to perform surgery to transplant all kinds of materials from Ternecia’s body, which has been turned into a Live-Dead, to Bellmond.<br/>
Vandalieu has also told her that he intends to find a monkey-type monster to transplant its tail to replace hers that was chopped off, but Bellmond wore a stiff expression.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Ternecia<br/>
<br/>
A Pure-breed Vampire, the one known as the most powerful in battle among the three that worship Hihiryushukaka, the Evil God of Joyful Life.<br/>
She contained the Demon King’s horns, a fragment of the Demon King Guduranis, inside her body as a trump card.<br/>
However, she met a horrible end after being forced to dance in Vandalieu’s rough plan. She was cornered by Heinz, ambushed at the place she escaped to and her body from her neck downwards was taken, as well as her Demon King’s Horns and Petrifying Demon Eye. Despite wanting to not be killed by Vandalieu and being finished by Heinz, in the end, Vandalieu used Spirit Communication to get information out of her and then broke her soul.<br/>
She is the one who met the most unfortunate fate in the fourth volume.<br/>
All of the Undead that she created were to satisfy her twisted desires that had become something like an addiction; they didn’t have the strength in battle or practicality of use that Vandalieu desired, but some of them were adjusted and added to the ranks of Talosheim.<br/>
Yamata is one of them.<br/>
The rest of them felt too much pain in merely existing and had too many structural problems with their bodies, or simply desired to be in other forms, so they are now waiting to undergo pseudo-reincarnation after Vandalieu took their spirits out of their bodies.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Froto<br/>
<br/>
Lucas’s hired spy who disguised himself as a priest of Alda who did missionary work in the cultivation villages. His role was to gather information in each village, and if Vandalieu hadn’t appeared, things would have progressed well. But around the time his plans finished, the Goblin King’s pack would have attacked, turning him into Goblin food along with all of the cultivation villages.<br/>
In a way, his life was extended a little thanks to Vandalieu.<br/>
He had the potential to be quite successful as a researcher, but unluckily for him, he was hated by his superior and given a useless position, which is why he stubbornly chased success in life.<br/>
But he met the fate of being infested by a parasite, experienced the sensation of insects crawling around him inside Vandalieu’s body and then he became food for insects that he could not see.<br/>
The fact that Vandalieu never realized who Froto truly was wasn’t because Froto was exceptional as a spy, but rather because Vandalieu was naïve.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Karcan Lassen<br/>
<br/>
An ordinary knight from a family of knights who serve the Hartner family. But he had great ambitions and joined Lord Lucas’s faction in order to make them a reality.<br/>
He was put in charge of a plan to destroy the cultivation project started by Lord Belton, but he experienced failure after failure due to Vandalieu’s actions. Despite being ordered to halt the plan, he became impatient and made a reckless move, causing him and his subordinates to be completely defeated.<br/>
Incidentally, if Vandalieu hadn’t come to the Hartner Duchy, the cultivation villages would have been destroyed by the Goblin King’s pack without Karcan needing to do anything. However, if that happened, there is no telling what would have happened to the slave-run mine and the city of Niarki.<br/>
His soul wasn’t broken after he died, but he was turned into a printing press Golem.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Belton Hartner<br/>
<br/>
He was born as the second son of the Duke Hartner, but because he is the son of the duke’s wife, he was first in line to succeed the family.<br/>
His features are not sharp, but they are gentle, the kind of features that the people like. However, he is a conspirator who would use any cruel methods needed to achieve his goals.<br/>
He is not as extreme as to believe that those who aren’t noblemen are not humans, but he believes that it is correct for the commoners to devote themselves to serving the noblemen, and that it is the duty of royalty and nobles to use the commoners in the most efficient way possible.<br/>
Incidentally, he does not consider those such as refugees to be his people. However, he does not mind adding them to his citizens if they work hard to make a living.<br/>
Due to the information exposed by Kinarp in the scandal, the Guild Master of the Mages’ Guild that was supporting him, it became clear that many of his close aides were traitors to humanity.<br/>
After that, he murdered various people responsible and utilized Heinz to try and restore his image, but he ended up withdrawing from the conflict to succeed the family.<br/>
But as he is still involved with the management of the duchy as the branch family, he believes that there is a chance by entrusting things to his child, even if things are now impossible for him.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Lucas Hartner<br/>
<br/>
He was born as the eldest son of Duke Hartner, but as he is the son of the duke’s concubine, he was second in line to succeed the family.<br/>
He is a military man with sharp facial features, but at the end of volume 4, his troubles were only growing as he had to repair the castle, cover up what happened to the Red Wolves Knights’ Order and build a new fort, causing his hair to turn gray.<br/>
He took incredible risks at the end of volume 4, so he feels a great sense of danger. Although he is now building a fort because of that sense of danger, all of his hair would turn white if he learned that this is meaningless against Vandalieu (who can easily ignore the fort by using Dungeon teleportation).<br/>
If he meets Vandalieu, he might have claws stuck in his ears and his teeth made to rattle*.<br/>
TLN*: This line was explained in chapter 93. This is a variation on a threat that’s commonly used in the Osaka prefecture that’s something like, “I’ll stick my hand in through your ears and grab your teeth.”<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Pablo Marton<br/>
<br/>
The captain of the Red Wolves Knights’ Order.<br/>
He rode out with a hundred knights, but this number was an order of magnitude less than the number he required.<br/>
He is ordinary for a nobleman of Lambda, and he exchanged a one-on-one conversation with Vandalieu.<br/>
After being captured alive and humiliated publicly, he became Luciliano’s guinea pig and then turned into a printing press Golem along with his subordinate Karcan.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Heinz<br/>
<br/>
One of Vandalieu’s targets for revenge. While working in the Orbaume Kingdom, he has acknowledged that Alda’s peaceful faction is right and that Vida’s races should be accepted (as long as they are harmless to people).<br/>
After going separate ways from the Green Wind Spear Riley, he moved to the Orbaume Kingdom, but he lost the Elf spirit mage Martie when his party challenged the Trial of Zakkart.<br/>
His current party consists of two new members in Scout Edgar and the Shield-bearer female Dwarf Delizah, as well as the unarmed fighter Jennifer and Elf priestess Diana.<br/>
He feels guilt over handing Darcia to High Priest Gordan, even if it was an adventurer’s request to do so. After much internal conflict, he converted to Alda’s peaceful faction, and now he is something of a leader of the faction. In doing so, he began protecting the Dhampir girl Selen.<br/>
His objective as an adventurer is the complete clearing of the Trial of Zakkart, but things became complicated and he recently ended up going around trying to exterminate the Pure-breed Vampires who worship an evil god.<br/>
He is not a reincarnated champion or the descendant of someone who came from another world; he is a natural-born genius, purely of Lambda origin. As an adventurer, he has an unstoppable sense of justice and idealistic ways of thinking, but he has the ability and charisma to make such ideals possible, or at least make others think that they are possible.<br/>
He didn’t know that Darcia’s child survived, but he suspects that the Dhampir boy he saw in the city of Niarki (Vandalieu) is that child.<br/>
He also suspects that Eleanora was involved in the incidents that occurred in the Hartner Duchy, so he is looking for her and her master, but he has not realized that her master is Vandalieu.<br/>
Judging from his normal speech and actions, one could guess that he hates those who can create Undead, but that isn’t a hatred specifically directed at Vandalieu; it is a very normal thought as a believer of Alda.<br/>
Incidentally, even Alda’s peaceful faction treats Undead as targets to be exterminated or purified; they do not believe that they can coexist with Undead. The act of creating Undead is treated as a sin that desecrates life and goes against the laws of life and death.<br/>
In terms of ability, he is S-class. He has strength in battle rivalling the Mirg shield-nation’s hero of two hundred years ago, the Divine Spear of Ice Mikhail.<br/>
In addition to this, he wields a magic sword and his body is fully equipped with legendary-class items.<br/>

<br/>
Amemiya Hiroto<br/>
<br/>
The leader of the reincarnated individuals in Origin. He has many, more powerful cheat-like abilities compared to the other reincarnated individuals, such as affinity for every attribute (There is no time attribute in Origin and nobody has yet been discovered to possess death-attribute Mana other than Vandalieu, so he has an affinity for the seven other attributes) and casting without incantations.<br/>
He gathered the reincarnated individuals in Origin together, used his way of thinking to found the Bravers organization and acted to ensure that the reincarnated individuals, who possessed non-magical special abilities that worked on unknown principles, were not ostracized.<br/>
However, as a result, he dealt the fatal blow to Amamiya Hiroto in Origin without realizing who he was, and ended up sending more of his companions to the battlefield.<br/>
All of this was a result of the fact that he decided to use the power that he had been given to live this second live correctly after having been hikikomori and a NEET on Earth. In fact, he has saved many lives.<br/>
However, he overlooked the fact that people could fall to temptation; he failed to realize that Kanata was committing cowardly crimes in secret.<br/>
Now, he is chasing after Murakami and the nine other reincarnated individuals who left the Bravers and joined a terrorist group.<br/>
In his private life, he has married Naruse Narumi and has a child.<br/>
Incidentally, he didn’t know of Amamiya Hiroto’s existence until Naruse Narumi approached him after having mistaken him for Amamiya. Of course, he is unaware that he has acquired the cheat-like abilities that were supposed to be Amamiya’s.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Ricklent<br/>
<br/>
The genie of time and magic. He is a genderless existence without form, and those who worship him depict him symbolically as a trio of beautiful women, old men, young men or boys, so he often takes this form.<br/>
He was involved in important events in Lambda; during his idle talk with Zuruwarn, he developed and implemented a system of Jobs and skills that supposedly existed in games in another world, interfering with the system created by the Demon King Guduranis that governed Dungeon creation and operation.<br/>
However, as a god, rather than being one who guides the people, the aspect of him being an ancestor of great mages and researchers is more prominent. His doctrine also consists of many teachings to encourage people to think like researchers and historians.<br/>
Thus, the Churches of this god often become more like research institutes than religious organizations. Also, places such as Mages’ Guilds are always decorated with symbols and statues dedicated to Ricklent.<br/>
When the Demon King invaded, he summoned Akutsu Haruka, who later became the creation-minded champion Ark. His relationship with her was one where they would give each other inspiration; rather than being a god and a follower, they were like friends who got along well.<br/>
During the battle between Alda and Vida that followed, he had his subordinate gods remain neutral as systems without personality, but Ricklent himself, who has a personality and was the leader of those gods, was Vida’s ally.<br/>
Also, it was actually Ricklent who informed Vida of the return of the soul that was Ark (and Zakkart).<br/>
In a way, he may be a god who holds more animosity for Alda and Bellwood than Vida.<br/>
Incidentally, the reason he did not try to discuss things with Alda and the others again was because he knew of the poor way that they had treated Vida. If he were to be attacked by Alda in his current state, he would be forced into another long slumber, so he will not take that risk.<br/>
By the time he came to this decision, Ricklent already no longer considered Alda to be among his companions.<br/>
He sent a Divine Message in order to accomplish the goals of Vandalieu, who was once Ark, but its contents and the identity of the one who received it is unknown.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Zuruwarn<br/>
<br/>
The god of space and creation. He is often depicted in grotesque forms, such as a lion with four heads.<br/>
His personality as a god is trickster-like, and his teachings are often whimsical as well. Thus, he is worshipped by inventors, artists and craftsmen. His statues often decorate Workers’ Guilds alongside those of Botin, but there are few Churches devoted exclusively to him.<br/>
As he is the being who governs space, he often gazed at other worlds since ancient times. He spoke to Ricklent of games played in other worlds, leading to the implementation of Jobs and skills in Lambda.<br/>
He was the one who came up with ideas among the original eleven gods, but his erratic thoughts caused many quarrels with Alda as well. However, he was never stubborn about his ideas, so situations never became too serious.<br/>
As he was the one who proposed and executed the idea of summoning the champions, he was close with all seven of them.<br/>
For this reason alone, he was wounded deeply during the war against the Demon King and fell into a slumber, and by the time he managed to recover enough to regain some semblance of consciousness, he found Lambda in an astounding state.<br/>
His suggestion had caused the champions’ deaths and even their souls were broken. Now that they are in the form of Vandalieu, he sent a Divine Message for their sake, but its contents and the identity of the one who received it is unknown.<br/>
