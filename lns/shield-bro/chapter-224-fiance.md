<br/>
Fiancé<br/>
Ren: "I’m fine like always"<br/>
Naofumi: "I see"<br/>
I decided to not go peddling today.<br/>
This time, the one going was the Hero of the Sword.<br/>
I still don’t completely trust Ren yet, but since he was wasting time at the village, I decided to let him go peddle while being escorted by the Female Knight.<br/>
If he doesn’t return, I will definitely kill him.<br/>
Ren: "Well then I’ll be heading out"<br/>
Naofumi: "Yeah"<br/>
Incidentally, Taniko is also going along to peddle.<br/>
She was reluctant, but I convinced her to leave the village.<br/>
It was quite the noisy struggle.<br/>
I also convinced Rat to watch over the monsters since she wasn’t that busy lately.<br/>
The reason being is thanks to Motoyasu and his army of Philorials.<br/>
Naofumi: "Don’t fight"<br/>
Taniko: "But the Hero of the Sword is-"<br/>
Taniko immediately came to me to complain.<br/>
She didn’t want to be near Ren. And of course I knew she had no interest in him either.<br/>
Naofumi: "I know that taking responsibility is useless. So I’m counting on you to watch over his feelings. Along with that arrogant and selfish Female Knight. It’ll be just like a romantic comedy."<br/>
Taniko: "…Romantic comedy?"<br/>
Well, Taniko wouldn’t be affected, but it would be an amusing situation to throw her in-between Ren and the Female Knight.<br/>
Though I might wake up the next day to find out that it turned into a murder mystery.<br/>
Naofumi: "Hurry up, get going"<br/>
Philorial: "Kue~"<br/>
…In front of me was a Philorial that just cried out kue.<br/>
You do realize that I know you can talk.<br/>
The carriage vanished at a remarkable speed.<br/>
Naofumi: "Well then, I should get ready to make lunch"<br/>
I began some small preparations in the kitchen.<br/>
Naofumi: "Do you want to eat something uncooked?"<br/>
Melty arrived while riding Firo.<br/>
Melty: "How rude. We came with a request for the village"<br/>
Melty: "Whether you take it seriously or not, you are still an Earl and I am your subordinate.<br/>
Naofumi: "Well, I suppose you’re right"<br/>
Melty: "I guess it can’t be helped, since you are the Hero of the Pot Lid"<br/>
Naofumi: "Melty… I never expected you to say that too!"<br/>
I thought it was only the soldiers who treated me as nothing but a cook, but it seems to have spread to the entire village.<br/>
Sometimes they try to make me cook for them, but I won’t let them have a single bite now.<br/>
Melty: "Huh? Did it offend you? I was under the impression that the Shield wouldn’t mind"<br/>
Naofumi: "Firo, you have exceeded the bounds of everyday friendship. That’s why, Firo I leave Melty to you."<br/>
Melty: "Stop bringing that up! It was an emergency situation-"<br/>
While we were talking, I finished all my preparations.<br/>
By the way, the request that Melty mentioned was that the Queen was coming to visit in the near future.<br/>
That was the official reason… but.<br/>
It seems to be a trap to draw out all the revolutionaries.<br/>
Whether it is ally or foe, there seems to be various conspiracies going on.<br/>
And, finally Melty who had enough of my teasing, left the village.<br/>
Damn, treating me like a babysitter. I’ll get my revenge later.<br/>
Speaking of which, the village is pretty quiet-<br/>
Motoyasu: "Father-in-Law!"<br/>
It can’t be.<br/>
Naofumi: "What is it, Motoyasu?"<br/>
Motoyasu: "What is it that you would like me to do?"<br/>
Naofumi: "Go to Cal Mira and make a portal there"<br/>
Hmm? His three followers looked confused when I mentioned Cal Mira Island.<br/>
Naofumi: "Go visit the hot springs, you can bring those guys as well"<br/>
Followers: "Yay"<br/>
That reminds me, Firo said that the Philorials had begun loosing interest in work.<br/>
While there are many reasons, I had no clue.<br/>
Just what kind of compounding did he make them do.<br/>
Motoyasu: "Well then, Father-in-Law when will you accept the engagement between Firo and I?"<br/>
Naofumi: "I already told you… wait until we achieve world peace!"<br/>
At least once a day we end up having this conversation.<br/>
I had enough of it already.<br/>
Do you really like Firo that much?<br/>
Naofumi: "So, Motoyasu, give up on Firo and settle for those three"<br/>
Upon my order, the three’s eyes started to sparkle.<br/>
Eh? What, is it really something that would make you guys that happy.<br/>
Motoyasu: "Hahaha, Father-in-Law that is a great joke"<br/>
Naofumi: "It is?"<br/>
Motoyasu: "After all, it’s a crime to lay ones hands on children"<br/>
…What?<br/>
Huh? Does that mean he hasn’t done anything to them yet?<br/>
That lecherous pile of lust Motoyasu?<br/>
This is unbelievable.<br/>
Midori: "It is as Master said, that going into heat won’t bring us happiness"<br/>
Motoyasu: "That is absolutely correct!"<br/>
Midori: "That’s right. We believe that Motoyasu-san is the one who can bring us true happiness"<br/>
The three stated chirping away in an uproar<br/>
Too noisy.<br/>
And lastly Green, just what are you planning to do with Motoyasu.<br/>
Naofumi: "So Motoyasu, I take it that you haven’t laid a hand on any of the Philorials in the village?"<br/>
Motoyasu: "Isn’t it obvious"<br/>
Naofumi: "Ah…I see"<br/>
Huh?<br/>
I recall seeing the Philorials carrying around eggs from their stable.<br/>
….<br/>
Philorial: "Kue-"<br/>
Naofumi: "Were those eggs Motoyasu’s?"<br/>
Philorial: "Kue! KUEKUE!"<br/>
To deny my accusations, the Philorial shakes it head.<br/>
Although its head’s motion is good, I still find it strange.<br/>
Naofumi: "Do their species lay edible eggs?"<br/>
Motoyasu: "I think so"<br/>
Philorial: "Kuekue"<br/>
Midori: "As I thought Serenity is fond of Master too. How popular" (TL note: I have no idea what name this could be ズリネタ for now I’ll go with Serenity)<br/>
…Hang on.<br/>
Midori: "The Future Queen Firo said that if she wasn’t here, we should give Master lots of love in her place"<br/>
I’m…I’m finished.<br/>
Calm down me, its just something a bird said.<br/>
Motoyasu: "Hahaha, Father-in-Law sure is popular. But I won’t lose either"<br/>
Naofumi: "Shut up!"<br/>
I’m at my limit with this ridiculous situation!<br/>
How do I get rid of this idiot.<br/>
Naofumi: "Hurry up and leave already"<br/>
Motoyasu: "Yes, the preparations are ready but I sill have some time left, right? So I want to spend it bonding with Father-in-Law"<br/>
Naofumi: "Get out!"<br/>
Motoyasu: "Hahaha. Father-in-Law, getting angry like that is bad for your blood pressure"<br/>
Dammit. I want this to end already.<br/>
Then I made a realization.<br/>
Right now I could have the best revenge on Melty for treating me like a babysitter.<br/>
Naofumi: "Motoyasu, I wanted to tell you earlier but… the truth is that Firo already has a Fiancé"<br/>
Motoyasu: "Of course Father-in-Law is referring to me"<br/>
Naofumi: "Your wrong"<br/>
Motoyasu: "Eh…?"<br/>
Motoyasu had an expression as if he was on the verge of collapse.<br/>
Fufufu…That’s the kind of face I wanted to see.<br/>
But then again, completely believing that you were already engaged is a problem itself.<br/>
Naofumi: "Her name is Melty Melromark. She is the future Queen of this country"<br/>
Motoyasu: "Wha…"<br/>
Naofumi: "Ah, Incidentally don’t think about killing Melty. She is taking care of Firo’s heat. I believe Firo is with her right now. Of course you realize how bad it would be if you killed her and Firo found out, right?"<br/>
Motoyasu: "Melty, if I remember right, she is the sister of Witch?"<br/>
Naofumi: "Yes, she is the younger sister of Witch and the legitimate heir to the throne. And I believe the right to choose belongs to Firo. But against those odds do you think you can win?"<br/>
Motoyasu: "W-well…"<br/>
Oh? Is he starting to get jealous?<br/>
Motoyasu: "Firo-tan’s Fiancé…I will make you recognize that it could only be me!"<br/>
Naofumi: "Okay?"<br/>
Motoyasu: "I will show you that the only one worthy enough to be Firo-tan’s Fiancé is me"<br/>
Motoyasu declared as he held his spear to the sky.<br/>
With that can you finally calm down?<br/>
It sounded nice, but it was going to end up a problem later.<br/>
Motoyasu: "Everyone, lets go!"<br/>
Followers: "Yes!"<br/>
Motoyasu goes to the carriage that is pulled by those three.<br/>
Followers: "Please give us your orders"<br/>
Motoyasu: "Isn’t it obvious!"<br/>
With Motoyasu’s reply, the three charge off to the town at an amazing speed.<br/>
Slave: "Did I see something amazing just now?"<br/>
A slave came to ask me.<br/>
Naofumi: "Well, I guess so"<br/>
With this the village is once again peaceful.<br/>
I still have some time before I meet with Atla for her compounding lessons.<br/>
Later that day, Melty, in a fit of rage, came firing magic at my home.<br/>
Furthermore, she wouldn’t stop until her magic was completely exhausted.<br/>
As a result, my house was completely demolished.<br/>
Well, It can’t be helped since I did think that I went a bit too far.<br/>
But it was something that was unavoidable when dealing with Firo.<br/>
Also, it seems that Motoyasu was able to converse with Melty without treating her like a blue pig.<br/>
Motoyasu must have recognized Melty as someone he could respect.<br/>
Motoyasu: "[I won’t give Firo-chan to the like of you!] I will make you accept it as fact! I will save Firo-tan from this impure relationship!"<br/>
Naofumi: "How did you end up talking with Melty?"<br/>
Motoyasu: "At first I thought that she was just a blue pig. But, since it was someone Firo wanted to get along with, I realized that it couldn’t be a pig. Although it hurts to admit it, she was indeed the future Queen"<br/>
Hmm, it seems that Firo can affect whether he sees someone as a pig or a women.<br/>
I should handle Motoyasu more carefully or it could end up badly.<br/>
Then again, Firo flirting with a blue pig was not the story I had told him.<br/>
Motoyasu: "But even so, I will not give up"<br/>
Motoyasu: "…I see hypnotism"<br/>
Of course the odds that Melty brainwashed Firo is zero.<br/>
Will Motoyasu ever grow out of that?<br/>
No, No. Motoyasu already has a complete monopoly on brainwashing.<br/>
I glad for you Melty.<br/>
Motoyasu seems to have recognized you as the only human women.<br/>
Not only that, the future Queen as well. And also as a rival in love.<br/>
Naofumi: "Now that everything is settled, hurry up and go make that portal at Cal Mira"<br/>
Motoyasu: "I understand, Father-in-Law. Let my actions be testimony to my worth as her Fiancé"<br/>
After hearing my words, Motoyasu left in earnest.<br/>
As a result of our experiments, I found out that it was possible for Heroes to use the portal of allies.<br/>
Although the system message said it wasn’t possible.<br/>
Either way, the village is once again quiet.<br/>
That being said, I told his three followers to try and stay at Cal Mira Island for as long as possible, but given his last words I shouldn’t expect too much.<br/>
<br/>
