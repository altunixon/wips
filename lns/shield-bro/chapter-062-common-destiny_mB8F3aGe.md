That Bitch! <br/>
Chapter 62 <br/>
 <br/>
Common Destiny <br/>
 <br/>
"Ah.....Melty......To think you would be brainwashed by the devil of the shield." <br/>
"Elder Sister?" <br/>
 <br/>
The second princess gives the bitch a look of astonishment. <br/>
 <br/>
That bitch...... <br/>
This is absolutely disgusting. <br/>
What kind of shield can brainwash. If I had such a thing, I wouldn't be having such a hard time. <br/>
To think she would claim I brainwashed someone without even flinching. <br/>
I mean the purpose of religion is brainwashing.  <br/>
What a joke. <br/>
 <br/>
"Does the wicked shield possess the power to brainwash? It seems fake......" <br/>
"I don't know if you have heard, but this was a suspicion of the church's from a month ago." <br/>
 <br/>
That's when I started peddling. <br/>
Selling medicine to sick people was my priority back then. <br/>
After that, rumours of me being the saint of the holy bird started spreading. <br/>
Indeed, that cannot be a coincidence. It turned out to be convenient for the church in various ways. <br/>
 <br/>
"this situation proves it. Were you guys not being clouded by the information he provided?And also about to help him? Is it common to help out with criminals?" <br/>
"Some of the countrymen are also acting strange. If the Hero of the shield can make an old grandmother energetic, he also might be capable of brainwashing." <br/>
 <br/>
That grandmother......I instantly know who that is. <br/>
 <br/>
However, don't I have a say in this? These guys...... <br/>
It is true that a lot of people have helped me recently. <br/>
However, that's just repaying me for saving them. <br/>
What I don't know = The enemy's strategy. <br/>
These guys are also stupid enough to believe it. <br/>
 <br/>
"He is probably brainwashing his companions to talk for him too. We are currently preparing some church authorized personnel with the power to remove the brainwashing." <br/>
"What kind of power is that!" <br/>
 <br/>
No one reacts to my retort <br/>
No, Raphtalia, Firo, and the second princess are also dumbfounded. <br/>
Let's think about this situation, The government is ordering the country to gather information, and also placing a high bounty on me. <br/>
A lie that I have the power to brainwash was fed to the three heroes by the bitch, she also has convincing fake evidence. Is that it? <br/>
Realistic forgeries.That's not impossible. <br/>
 <br/>
"Is the hero of the shield-sama that powerful?" <br/>
 <br/>
The second princess looks at me anxiously. <br/>
 <br/>
"Do I look like that to you?" <br/>
"Umm......I don't think so." <br/>
"I kind of hoped for an immediate answer." <br/>
 <br/>
I wouldn't be struggling so hard if I had such a convenient shield. <br/>
If I can brain wash the soldiers, knights, magicians, and villagers I could just become the lord. <br/>
I need to defend myself in this situation. <br/>
In other words this was arranged when they put that bounty on my head, the authenticity that the shield can brainwash is doubtful to say the least. <br/>
Do you god damn heroes not understand something so simple? <br/>
 <br/>
"So Raphtalia-chan and Firo-chan are being brainwashed forcefully by that guy!" <br/>
"You're wrong! We're not brainwashed!" <br/>
"We'll rescue you!" <br/>
"Firo wants to be with master!" <br/>
 <br/>
Motoyasu you bastard, still not given up on Firo and Raphtalia yet!? <br/>
Just how much do you like women? <br/>
 <br/>
"We've heard enough! Hand over the second princess!" <br/>
"Eh!?" <br/>
 <br/>
The second princess was surprised to gasp. <br/>
 <br/>
"......Will you tell us what happened?" <br/>
 <br/>
Ren takes the lead and asks. This is a volatile situation. I want to avoid wrong choices as much as possible. <br/>
 <br/>
"In the first place I have no such power as brainwashing-" <br/>
"I do not believe it!" <br/>
"Shut up! You're annoying, Shogun!" <br/>
 <br/>
Since Itsuki prevented me from explaining I told him to shut up. <br/>
Aren't you a hypocrite deciding on right and wrong only after you get one-sided information? <br/>
 <br/>
"Anyway, this is a conspiracy. The King, that woman over there, or the church attempted to assassinate the second princess and frame me for it." <br/>
"......I understand what you said. We'll just have to take you into custody first. I promise not to harm your companions. Just wait till the inspection is complete." <br/>
"You actually believe it!?" <br/>
"That's right!" <br/>
"Hero of the Sword-sama! Don't listen to the words of the devil!" <br/>
"I would rather end this without fighting. The truth can be confirmed later." <br/>
 <br/>
As expected Ren is the only one staying calm in this situation and analysing. <br/>
......Should I consider it? <br/>
 <br/>
"......No" <br/>
 <br/>
The second princess clenches my hand  tightly and begs. <br/>
She is trembling and her face is pale. <br/>
 <br/>
"I will most likely be murdered......" <br/>
 <br/>
I confirm the surrounding situation. <br/>
The second princess probably will receive treatment different from us. <br/>
Since in order to remove the brainwashing the second princess will be subjected to magic by magicians of this country. <br/>
And what happens will be as follows: A brutal curse will be removed from the second princess, but she will die because of its power. <br/>
Such a scenario will play out. <br/>
Ren will surely believe it and I will be branded the culprit. <br/>
The possibility that this is an event orchestrated by Bitch to frame me is very high. <br/>
To even aim for your younger sister...... <br/>
 <br/>
"Help......" <br/>
 <br/>
A small voice could be heard. <br/>
There is also no way to prove my innocence. <br/>
Sigh...... <br/>
 <br/>
"Didn't I promise?" <br/>
"Eh?" <br/>
 <br/>
During that day I was falsely accused to rape. Nobody believed me. <br/>
And now this matter concerns the life and death of the second princess. <br/>
Brainwashing...... what a convenient plot used by those that want to kill the second princess. <br/>
 <br/>
This is too obvious....... <br/>
Even I know that much. <br/>
The second princess's death means our defeat. <br/>
We definitely have a common destiny. Who would trust an untrustworthy person? <br/>
 <br/>
"Too bad. You cannot be trusted. Even if the second princess is handed over I will still be screwed. I promised her that I would absolutely protect her." <br/>
 <br/>
I place the second princess on Firo's back and tell Raphtalia to get on as well. <br/>
 <br/>
"Firo I know you hate it but abandon the wagon and run!" <br/>
"Okay~!" <br/>
"See ya." <br/>
 <br/>
I also jump on and Firo takes off. <br/>
 <br/>
"Ah, wait-" <br/>
"Okay let's go-!" <br/>
 <br/>
We are instantly 7 meters away. As I expected, Firo's leg strength is truly fearsome. <br/>
But those three aren't falling behind and keep pace. <br/>
 <br/>
"You think you can escape!?" <br/>
 <br/>
Itsuki shoots magic arrows at us. <br/>
 <br/>
"Air Strike Shield! Second Shield!" <br/>
 <br/>
I turn around and chant the skills. Blocking the attacks aimed at us. <br/>
The shield shattered with a loud crack, but the attacks have been neutralized. <br/>
 <br/>
"You won't escape!" <br/>
 <br/>
Itsuki's starts to prepare another arrow. <br/>
I cannot use the shield any more due to cooldown time. <br/>
 <br/>
"Eagle Piercing Shot!" <br/>
 <br/>
Itsuki's arrow glows after being shot and flies straight at us. <br/>
What the hell. The one you should be protecting, the second princess is here too. <br/>
Why are you using such a strong skill! <br/>
While riding on Firo I am forced to change my posture to receive the arrow. <br/>
 <br/>
"Master are you okay?" <br/>
 <br/>
Firo supports me so that I don't fall over. <br/>
 <br/>
"That arrow...... Firo! It's coming!" <br/>
"Yeah, It's very fast." <br/>
 <br/>
The arrow which Itsuki shot is fast enough to catch up to the light-footed Firo. <br/>
At first glance I understand that it's a lump of energy.This doesn't look like a beginner skill. <br/>
I change my shield to the Chimeric Viper Shield and prepare. <br/>
I hope I can endure this. <br/>
I stare that the lump of energy. Then, I see an arrow. <br/>
It's flying fast and in a straight line. <br/>
 <br/>
......Can it be done? Firo might fall over from the impact if I take it badly. <br/>
 <br/>
No.....Judging by the name of the skill, this is meant for penetrating. <br/>
Because I played a fair amount of Net Games, the name of bow system attacks aren't unfamiliar. <br/>
This arrow is meant to pierce a hole right through me. <br/>
It is a skill used specifically since I am here, such high efficiency. <br/>
 <br/>
Then it's not possible to receive this arrow. <br/>
Can't be helped...... the only way to escape this penetration attack is to either get out of range or to catch it. <br/>
Can I do it? If I fail this will dangerous. <br/>
Seriously, you guys totally forgot about the second princess right? <br/>
......I start to focus. <br/>
 <br/>
I intensely concentrate on the flying attack, While lightly putting my hand over it's energy, I catch the arrow by it's shaft just before it reaches me! <br/>
 <br/>
"What!? He caught my Eagle Piercing Shot with his hand!?" <br/>
 <br/>
Itsuki responds to my action by expressing his shock. <br/>
The shot of energy is unexpectedly weak, I just dispersed the power and caught the arrow. <br/>
 <br/>
"Wait!" <br/>
 <br/>
Ugh! Ren and Motoyasu catch up and take out their weapons. <br/>
I had to make some unnecessary movements to catch Itsuki's arrow and just barely stop falling off. <br/>
Our speed fell a bit as a result. <br/>
To think that they would have companions that could catch up. <br/>
 <br/>
"I do not want to attack Firo-chan, this is all your fau--Gefu" <br/>
"Hindrance." <br/>
 <br/>
Firo stomps Motoyau in the face. Was it that unexpected? <br/>
This isn't the time now. Ren aims his sword at me. <br/>
Dokun...... <br/>
The shield pulsates, and I unconsciously stretch my right hand towards Ren's sword. <br/>
Fresh blood scatters and pain runs through my hand. <br/>
Why!? It is different from what I expected. Ren's eyes do not shift, as if he's being manipulated by something. <br/>
My shield suddenly glows red, and black flames are fired at Ren. <br/>
 <br/>
"Wh--" <br/>
 <br/>
This was probably unpredictable. Ren desperately defends with his sword. <br/>
Is that Dark Curse Burning? Did the core of the dragon killed by Ren react and counter attack from the shield? <br/>
To think the shield would change without permission and flash red. <br/>
Dokun......Dokun...... <br/>
Oh shit. It would be impossible for Firo to run away from here if the shield of anger comes out. <br/>
 <br/>
"Raphtalia, give me your hand......" <br/>
"Yes? Naofumi-sama!? You are injured!" <br/>
 <br/>
An anxious Raphtalia looks at me with concern and stretches out her hand.  <br/>
The pulsations settled down and subsides. <br/>
 <br/>
"Firo are you okay? Escape as fast as possible!" <br/>
"Okay~!" <br/>
 <br/>
Firo regains her balance and runs at full power. <br/>
We lose the heroes in no time. <br/>
After that, Firo ran at full power till she was exhausted. <br/>
 <br/>
"We should be safe for a while here." <br/>
"Yeah, Firo-chan is fast~!" <br/>
"Firo is a little tired." <br/>
"That's fine......but we lost all our luggage and our wagon." <br/>
"Can't be helped." <br/>
 <br/>
I have some stuff one me, portable rations, money, a knife, and simple cooking utensils. <br/>
But we lost Raphtalia's armour...... <br/>
I feel uneasy. I think it's showing on my expression. <br/>
 <br/>
"Since we did not cross the border, what will we do now?......" <br/>
 <br/>
We can probably run around the country aimlessly. <br/>
But we have to at least try to get to Silt Welt by a detour route. <br/>
We'll continue our fugitive lifestyle <br/>
By the way, I cured the injury with a Fast Heal.
