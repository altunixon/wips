<br/>
At long last, I present Chapter 171!!~~<br/>
Portal Shield<br/>
"I get that Witch grew up spoiled, but what about Melty?" (Naofumi)<br/>
"That child was brought up with an exclusive teacher. So as much as possible, she was not too influenced by that person." (Queen)<br/>
And that’s why Melty is respectable, compared to her sister.<br/>
Just compared to her sister though.<br/>
Because if I had to say, Melty’s emotionalness stands out.<br/>
She was angry even when we first met, and was also in hysterics recently.<br/>
"Ah, right, Iwatani-sama has somehow changed how he calls her, so I made the name change official." (Queen)<br/>
"You did well to distiguish it, despite the two names being mostly the same." (Naofumi)<br/>
"I also heard of it through Shadow’s report." (Queen)<br/>
"Did you hear about the source of the name?" (Naofumi)<br/>
"Iwatani-sama’s world plays a factor. I dare say…. it’s probably a play on the words succubus or satan…sorceress or something, right?" (Queen) [T/N: In japanese, the three words share the character 魔 (魔性 devilishness, 悪魔 demon, 魔女 witch)]<br/>
"Mn, correct." (Naofumi)<br/>
However, what is with you coming up with those words to be associated with your own daughter?<br/>
Well, that’s the impression you get when talking about Witch though.<br/>
"Also, I am entrusting this to Melty but what what will you do about the tax rate in your land?" (Queen)<br/>
Tax rate, huh.<br/>
When I think about it, the nobles originally only had to deal with the land management and doing nothing was a virtue, right?<br/>
Well, I don’t know if that’s even the case in this alternate world.<br/>
"Having high tax rates while we’re still reconstructing is a bit….." (Naofumi)<br/>
It’s because it’s this kind of occasion that the populace’s power is swayed.<br/>
I feel that demanding taxes while they’re still unable to live as they please will cause everything to fail.<br/>
I understand that the Japan I lived in also had such a sore point.<br/>
Even though we’re in hard times, it’ll accelerate if taxes are raised. The recession, that is.<br/>
If you look at history and stuff, taxes must be lowered during a recession.<br/>
Having said that, as long as we are spirited, we can still expect revenue somehow.<br/>
…Well, I don’t know much about it.<br/>
"For now, we should lower those things that will affect the reconstruction and livelihood and raise the prices of luxury goods and such…." (Naofumi)<br/>
"I’ll have Iwatani-sama’s show us your abilities."<br/>
"I hope you don’t expect too much." (Naofumi)<br/>
How should I say it, I’m not that exceptional.<br/>
One way or another, it’s just using the power of the Shield.<br/>
Come to think of it, it’s almost time for the Bioplants to produce medical herbs so I’ll be able to manufacture medicine soon.<br/>
My purchasing has also been enhanced, and my property investments are somehow quite substantial.<br/>
One way or another, I’ll be able to sell medicine.<br/>
"I heard from the reports that you made a rather interesting building. Something about a plant that simply becomes a building?" (Queen)<br/>
….So you’re indirectly asking about Rato.<br/>
Just like I’m being cautious, even the country wants to be careful.<br/>
"Right, I created it with that Alchemist who was causing all that trouble in Forburei." (Naofumi)<br/>
I hand a Camping Plant Seed to the Queen.<br/>
"This is a prototype for now." (Naofumi)<br/>
"Will you be using this for business as well?" (Queen)<br/>
"There’s the issue of it going rampant so I think it’s dangerous for it to be distributed too much." (Naofumi)<br/>
For now, there aren’t any problems but I don’t know when something will happen.<br/>
The problem is that that danger is capable of reviving, especially with strange crossbreeding.<br/>
When I was doing management tasks, a lot of places were lost because of the waves so at most I was going to use them as a demonstration." (Naofumi) [T/N: Talking about the village being destroyed and camping plant was a trial modification.]<br/>
My place is the result of displaying this technique, and originally I had the intention of emphasising the selling of medicine.<br/>
"Then how about selling to nobles? Hypothetically speaking, if you cast magic to prevent crossbreeding then it might be good value to sell them as disposable products." (Queen)<br/>
"That’s also an option but…" (Naofumi)<br/>
It’s not like I can’t do it by fiddling with the plant modification. It’ll work if I change the fertillity value to the lowest setting.<br/>
It might be good if it’s those nobles.<br/>
"I haven’t recieved any complaints but is it alright?" (Naofumi)<br/>
"The ones who’ll have complaints about the Hero of the Shield-sama’s work are the current authorities."<br/>
"That’s what I’m worried about though…." (Naofumi)<br/>
Either way, land management is difficult. I’m under the pretense of teaching Melty but it seems like I’m being taught instead.<br/>
It’s agony to yield to that short-tempered Melty.<br/>
"Come to think of it, how are the country’s nobles? Giving me, the Hero of the Shield, such hospitality is essentially just due to the Queen’s own judgement, right?" (Naofumi)<br/>
"For the time being, there’s no problems. Instead it’s so calm that it’s ominous." (Queen)<br/>
"It seems like something will happen?" (Naofumi)<br/>
"…Yes. Regrettably it’s at a state that I can’t reach with my power." (Queen)<br/>
I don’t have any conclusive evidence but I have a hunch. My hunches are usually right when it comes to things like this though.<br/>
Originally I’m like that too, managing a Demi-human village in a human dominated country, but the Queen, who embraces the Hero of the Shield worshipped by the Demihumans, is the Queen.<br/>
"This concerns that trouble-making Alchemist but, it seems she’s adapting to Iwatani-sama’s place from what I can see from the reports." (Queen)<br/>
"Yeah, it’s surprising how fast it was. What really happened in Forburei?" (Naofumi)<br/>
"It’s as she said. Somehow it seems that Forburei’s Seven Star Heroes exiled her due to a conflict over her research and techniques. I suspect it’s that, rather than a religious issue." (Queen)<br/>
One way or another, that guy has her own techniques. So she was exiled because of them.<br/>
I don’t know what she was researching in Forburei though….<br/>
Somehow, the atmosphere reeks of ‘Japan and a certain country competing with their car import businesses’. It resembles being chased out by political power.<br/>
Well, Forburei will probably reveal new weapons eventually.<br/>
If it makes the waves and living easier then it’s good though. I won’t be depending on it either. I still need Rato’s support.<br/>
"So this is how the reports are, huh." (Naofumi)<br/>
"That is the case, we’ll be awaiting your next visit." (Queen)<br/>
With her head lowered, the Queen started to take her leave.<br/>
"That’s right, there’s ore excavated from the spirit turtle in the castle warehouse so go ahead and take some whenever you like." (Queen)<br/>
"Ah, please turn those materials over to my regular weapon shop." (Naofumi)<br/>
"Alright." (Queen)<br/>
Because I want to become Oyaji’s power somehow. I want to give him priority.<br/>
With that feeling, the conversation ended and we went to the Hourglass of the Dragon’s Era for Fohl and Sadina’s Level Reset.<br/>
At the same time, I recieved some of the sand from the Hourglass of the Dragon’s Era. I let the shield absorb it.<br/>
The Dragon’s Era Sand Shield was unlocked.<br/>
Dragon’s Era Sand Shield    0/60 C<br/>
Ability Sealed…Equipment Bonus, Skill [Portal Shield]<br/>
Proficiency 0<br/>
I had a look at the sudden pop-up….there were no special skills attached. Its ability wasn’t very high either.<br/>
"Portal Shield!" (Naofumi)<br/>
With a *Pop*, an icon appeared in my field of vision.<br/>
Transfer <-<br/>
Transfer Memory<br/>
Where was the initial transfer location?<br/>
I identify the transfer.<br/>
Melromarc Summon Space.<br/>
Ah, it’s that room I first appeared in. It’s unlikely to be anywhere else.<br/>
I should try jumping as a test.<br/>
When I do, I become aware of the range.<br/>
I can also designate comrades that can be transfered. It seems that i can also jump unintentionally.<br/>
Moreover it’s pretty vast. So there’s no need to be touching or anything.<br/>
They also have it as an emergency escape skill.<br/>
"Then I’m going to use the transfer skill to experiment." (Naofumi)<br/>
"Okay!" (Firo)<br/>
"Oh, it looks quite fun." (Sadina)<br/>
"You’re going to do it?" (Fohl)<br/>
Fohl startled and grasped onto Sadina. Sadina also embraced Fohl.<br/>
Firo was….<br/>
"That’s right Firo. Distance yourself a little more please." (Naofumi)<br/>
"Hm? Understood~" (Firo)<br/>
The human-shaped Firo trotted away from me.<br/>
It should be something like this.<br/>
I become aware of the transfer.<br/>
When I do, the scenery changes, and I jumped to the damp and humid, earth-smelling altar.<br/>
Speaking of which, this is that kind of place.<br/>
There’s no one around and there’s no ceremony being held so it’s natural.<br/>
"You really jumped. How interesting~" (Sadina)<br/>
Sadina cackled with laughter. Say, you’re always laughing.<br/>
Fohl blinked with surprise.<br/>
Firo… separated from me and yet she was standing close by.<br/>
It’s sure is a convenient skill…<br/>
What was the cooldown time like?<br/>
"Portal Shield!" (Naofumi)<br/>
Reuse time, a countdown time of 1 hour appeared.<br/>
It’s longer than I expected.<br/>
Well, if it was short then it could be utilised in battle.<br/>
"Now then, let’s return." (Naofumi)<br/>
Just like this, we finished experimenting and returned to the village.<br/>
By the way, it seems like the possible transfer point memory of the Portal Shield is fundamentally impossible inside caves and buildings. The summoning space was the initial point and that’s why there’s that sort of treatment.<br/>
And so, if I can’t transfer to places that cant be registered, then it’s practical to jump to somewhere different.<br/>
Moreover, there’s actually no need to shout, just moving my mouth lets me jump.<br/>
I covered my mouth with my own hand and just by saying ‘Portal Shield’, an icon appeared.<br/>
Futhermore, starting with my party members, I have the option of select allies in my surroundings to transfer with.<br/>
That is to say, it can still be used even if an ally is caught by the enemy.<br/>
Furthermore, a hostile opponent can’t be transported.<br/>
In short, monsters, the heroes and Witch aren’t allies so I can’t forcably take them with me.<br/>
That’s a nuisance…<br/>
Ah, that’s right. Speaking of limits, it seems like the carriage is too big and is impossible to transport.<br/>
That’s why the other heroes didn’t use carriages.<br/>
