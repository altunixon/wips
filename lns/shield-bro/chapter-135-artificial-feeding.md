Chapter 135 : Artificial Feeding<br/>
I let Firo pull the carriage and we march in the middle of the night; we arrived at the outskirts of Raphtalia’s village in the morning.<br/>
"Master, we have arrived." (Firo)<br/>
"Good." (Naofumi)<br/>
While I was sleeping Kiel tried to play a prank on me and got reprimanded harshly by Raphtalia.<br/>
Of course with the exception of Raphtalia and Rishia, the slaves got harsh restriction and the slave mark got set to activate immediately if they tried to attack me.<br/>
Also, because of what Bitch did before, now I immediately awake when something happened.<br/>
On the first day we went to work with the slaves to demolish the building wreckages.<br/>
"This house is important to me!" (Kiel)<br/>
Kiel shouted in rejection.<br/>
"it’s important to treasure your house, but look, the roof has fallen, the wall has been destroyed. It’s a pity, but you’ll have to accept that there are house that can still be repaired and those that beyond repair." (Naofumi)<br/>
I searched for stuff that either have monetary value or can still be used but they are either robbed or there simply none, there are still some items left behind but they are already too rusted to be of use.<br/>
The water well seems salvageable.<br/>
The field… seems need some considerable maintenance.<br/>
"I understand the feeling of not wanting to discard your memories, but from the standpoint of reconstruction the stuff that are going to get in the way need to be discarded" (Naofumi)<br/>
"But-" (Kiel)<br/>
"Kiel-kun! Stop saying selfish things!" (Raphtalia)<br/>
Raphtalia warn him. Well, it’s not necessarily need to stop him.<br/>
Even so…<br/>
"This is the house that you once lived in." (Naofumi?)<br/>
"It is!" (Kiel)<br/>
"Then, the newly built house here will be yours." (Naofumi?)<br/>
"eh?" (Kiel)<br/>
The brat called Kiel looked at me with puzzled expression.<br/>
"Under the condition that you will become the one who manage the communal house. You will become responsible for the place where the others are gathering." (Naofumi)<br/>
"U-un." (Kiel)<br/>
Kiel nodded vaguely to my words<br/>
"That’s why — NOW! Firo!" (Naofumi)<br/>
"YES!" (Firo)<br/>
The moment Kiel showed an opening. Firo charges at the deserted house and promptly did flying kick at the fulcrum of the house and destroyed it.<br/>
"AaaaaAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA!?" (Kiel) (TL: Yes, scream louder)<br/>
Leaving the dumbfounded Kiel, I went to the next task.<br/>
Before noon the materials for building houses and the castle’s soldiers that the queen prepared arrived.<br/>
Stones, lumbers… and is it plasters?<br/>
"Hero of the shield-sama objective are to reconstruct this place?" (Soldier)<br/>
The soldier seems to have heard the story from the queen.<br/>
"Aa, at the very least I want the roof to be constructed before the day end. I’m aware of this unreasonable request but I’m counting on you." (Naofumi)<br/>
"We might be soldiers but we do have some knowledge about construction. So please leave it to us." (Soldier)<br/>
"Please do." (Naofumi<br/>
Construction and Conscription… are they even related? (TLN : https://thedefend.wordpress.com/2014/11/03/chapter-135-artificial-feeding/#comment-4)<br/>
And then I realized it was about to become noon.<br/>
"For the time being we will left the building to the soldiers, Raphtalia, Firo, and then Rishia."<br/>
"Yes." (Raphtalia)<br/>
"Wha—at?" (Firo)<br/>
"What is it? (Rishia)<br/>
Those three replied to my call<br/>
"After this I will start making lunch, after you finished your meal you three along with the slaves will go out and begin demon extermination."<br/>
"Understood" (Raphtalia)<br/>
"Yeah." (Firo)<br/>
"I’ll do my best." (Rishia)<br/>
"I’ll leave the squad composition to you. Having too much people will be detrimental on the EXP that will be obtained okay." (Naofumi)<br/>
I haven’t attempted to do an actual measurement, just how much will the amount decreased?<br/>
Rather, how does the distribution system works? I have no idea at all how the EXP distribution system work.<br/>
"Is there anyone who knew the details?" (Naofumi)<br/>
"Um…" (Rishia)<br/>
Rishia raised her hand apologetically .<br/>
"What?" (Naofumi)<br/>
"The people who are inside the party receive the same amount of EXP. The maximum limit for that is 6 people. Anymore than that will causing the amout of EXP obtained to decrease." (Rishia)<br/>
Oh, so that’s why you were left out.<br/>
Though if I said that she would probably cry ‘Fueee’ so it’s better to stay silent. It’s annoying.<br/>
In an expedition with a large amount of people there doesn’t seem to be a problem in dividing the group.<br/>
That mean that it is sufficient to organize 6 people in 1 team.<br/>
Instead of multiple team fighting against one demon, it’s better to separate into different areas.<br/>
"I understand the explanation" (Naofumi)<br/>
"Alright. Then we will be splitting up." (Naofumi?)<br/>
"Leave it to me." (Raphtalia?)<br/>
I gave authority to Raphtalia to make a party.<br/>
At the present we had 8 slaves that’s why Rishia led two person, and Raphtalia and Firo led 3 person.<br/>
"Then I’ll start cooking lunch so lend me a hand." (Naofumi)<br/>
"Yes!" (Raphtalia)<br/>
Then the three people begin to help as much as they can.<br/>
"Raphtalia-chan will be helping out?" (Kiel)<br/>
Kiel who just recovered from his absentminded state began to stare at me who are in the middle of cooking preparation while asking Raphtalia.<br/>
He recovered pretty quickly. Is it because he is still a child?<br/>
"Raphtalia-chan was always bad at housework." (Kiel)<br/>
"Erm…" (Raphtalia)<br/>
With a troubled look Raphtalia send me a glance.<br/>
What? What do you expect me to do?<br/>
She seems want to show her friend his good side, Raphtalia timidly began to open her mouth.<br/>
"Should I help?" (Raphtalia)<br/>
"Should I just randomly grill some meat or make some soup? I would prefer it if it were a dish that I could just leave over a fire for a while." (Naofumi)<br/>
The meal that I made taste good so I’ve been the one who did the cooking.<br/>
I’ve already used to it. Lately everyone has been leaving the cooking to me.<br/>
"It’s enough if you just help me clean up." (Naofumi)<br/>
I began to cut the ingredients to chunks. The meat was large so it was kind of hard to cut with a cooking knife.<br/>
With that said, when Raphtalia was the one who cook the food they didn’t taste good and Firo said to just leave all the cooking to me…<br/>
I ignore their complaints and began cooking.<br/>
By the way, It’s possible to cook the recipe with the shield but there is a very big flaw in this. Before fighting the turtle spirit cooking was already easy, I tried cooking with the shield at Calmira island but…<br/>
"Food is coming out of the shield!" (Firo)<br/>
Firo stared at my shield enviously with great excitement.<br/>
"Ah, It was made with the shield’s skill." (Naofumi)<br/>
"It’s awesome." (Firo)<br/>
The food that served is a spaghetti like food that is unique to this world.<br/>
The name of the food seems to be naporata. (TLN: Yes, that is what the raw said)<br/>
To be honest It sounded like the variety kind of pasta from my world, the shield seems to change the name of the item so it resembles the item from my world.<br/>
"It taste somewhat… normal." (Raphtalia)<br/>
"Yeah… normal." (Firo)<br/>
Seems like the food quality was affected, it tasted normal and it doesn’t contain the subtle delicate tastes.<br/>
It doesn’t taste bad. But it doesn’t taste good either. It’s definitely normal.<br/>
"Master’s cooking is way better."(Firo)<br/>
"That’s true. Even when it’s cold the food that Naofumi-sama made is still a declicious." (Raphtalia)<br/>
"I- I got it." (Naofumi)<br/>
For some reason those two stare at me with reproachful gaze and it made me remembered that I’ve been looked at with those kind of eyes.<br/>
Come to think of it, these two no longer satisfied by food from restaurant and only pleased by the food that I cooked.<br/>
I don’t think it’s possible to become a gourmet after just eating my food once. But at least they seems to be motivated by my food. (Tln : raw said gourmet but I think it meant picky)<br/>
Come to think of it, what if the situation where I am the cook got reversed?<br/>
For the time being I better assemble cooking team because at the moment there is no restaurant in the surrounding area.<br/>
"Here, the food is ready, after you finished eating go out already." (Naofumi)<br/>
I distribute the meat that I grilled above the crude iron plate and the soup that have been cooked.<br/>
"As I thought this is absolutely delish." (Slave A)<br/>
"Yeah! It’s really good." (Slave B)<br/>
The slaves devour the food with smile on their face.<br/>
I also treat the soldiers that made the house some food as well.<br/>
"This…. I’ve never eaten such a delicious grilled meal before!?" (Soldier A)<br/>
"Are you kidding? They made some of those at the castle and they didn’t taste good at all." (Soldier B)<br/>
The shield’s handmade correction is endless.<br/>
Did you guys knead any salt and spice on the meat beforehand?<br/>
The slaves devoured the food that I cooked.<br/>
Nevertheless, there is no need to eat that much.<br/>
It’ll be bad if I don’t prepare enough food after they returned from levelling.<br/>
"Now then, you lots, each and everyone of you will be carrying a weapon and then you will fight." (Naofumi)<br/>
And with that declaration the slaves become scared.<br/>
Just like the old Raphtalia, the girl turned pale when received the bladed tools.<br/>
I hand the second-hand weapons that I got from the castle to them. Most of them are dagger designed for beginners.<br/>
"Prepare yourself that if you did not fight you will feel pain on your chest. And if you do that, don’t ever think of returning to your hometown." (Naofumi)<br/>
"Gu…." (Kiel)<br/>
Kiel tried to complain to me on behalf of the others.<br/>
But Raphtalia interrupt him and prevent him to say anything.<br/>
"I don’t exactly need you people for anything. Only for territory development. But, because Raphtalia has been obediently following my orders you guys will become her present. So don’t misunderstand or anything." (Naofumi)<br/>
The slaves glaring at me provokingly.<br/>
I’ve used to playing the role of the bad guy in this world. Besides, I’m not doing this for charity or anything. There is no need to anxiously worried about the future since I’m planning to return to my own world anyway. I need to prepare a place for Raphtalia so she can spend her time peacefully.<br/>
"Now then… Firo, I want you to place all the monsters that you defeat into the wagon. There are a lot of use for them." (Naofumi)<br/>
"Yeess!" (Firo)<br/>
Mainly as food.<br/>
Later, just like what Ren did I should absorb those stuff into the shield. (TLN : Probably as item instead of shield unlock)<br/>
Right now those heroes are still way ahead of me (TLN: either in term of absorbed material or EXP)<br/>
"Come on, off you go then. See ya." (Naofumi)<br/>
I point at Firo’s carriage and ordered them.<br/>
The slaves reluctantly ride the carriage. Firo started to pull the carriage and went to hunt.<br/>
"Mind the speed." (Naofumi)<br/>
"ye-s!" (Firo)<br/>
The carriage made gotogoto sound as firo pulled them.<br/>
"I’ll leave the house construction to you then." (Naofumi)<br/>
"U-understood." (Soldier)<br/>
I asked the soldiers to begin construction, set the shield to start compounding, and next is to start cooking.<br/>
It’s only a little bit more until the demon egg hatched.<br/>
Before the Spirit Turtle meat ran out I need to find a way to supply food.<br/>
"Well then…" (Naofumi)<br/>
The slaves that went together with Raphtalia returned back at evening.<br/>
Everyone is exhausted. The demons that were defeated are loaded onto the chained carts. Right now we need food immediately, they did good.<br/>
But right now, there is something that is more awful.<br/>
Guuuuuu……。<br/>
Guuu……。<br/>
Kyururururururu……。<br/>
Gugyururururururu……。<br/>
The sound sounded like roar.<br/>
I wonder what would happen when they suddenly increased in level at an environment where food is scarce? I’m slighty curious.<br/>
Perhaps they won’t die but they’ll definitely starving. I think that while looking at Raphtalia.<br/>
The body which is undergoing rapid growth want nourishment thus they became hungry.<br/>
"You guys finally returned, did you guys fight properly?" (Naofumi)<br/>
"erm, everyone did their best." (Raphtalia)<br/>
Raphtalia answered with a smile.<br/>
I saw the slaves faces and their expression are difficult.<br/>
I didn’t ask for a Sparta kind of thing, but they seems to be unsatisfied.<br/>
"Fuee…. So tired." (Rishia)<br/>
"Oh, Rishia, how was your condition?" (Naofumi)<br/>
"It feels easier to move than before" (Rishia)<br/>
Certainly her status are higher before the level reset. With this battle should become a little more easier.<br/>
"Rishia-neechan. Why are you wearing the plushie?" (Slave)<br/>
"That is because Rishia is a plushie mania." (Naofumi)<br/>
"Fuee!" (Rishia)<br/>
Rishia tried to deny it while shaking her head left and right, but there is no mistake about that.<br/>
"I really have to accept after all." (Kiel)<br/>
Kiel finally consented about the management.<br/>
He hate me so he can’t trust me.<br/>
"If you work the it’ll be good. It’s dinner now" (Naofumi)<br/>
I put the spirit turtle stew and the steak that I have prepared beforehand on the table.<br/>
I do this because I’ve been expecting it.<br/>
I made a lot of them but they’ll definitely disappear immediately.<br/>
"""Waaaaaa.""" (The Slaves)<br/>
The slaves began to eat excitedly.<br/>
Yoshiyoshi….<br/>
"Master, where is Firo’s share?" (Firo)<br/>
"You have it." (Naofumi)<br/>
I take out Firo’s part.<br/>
They are about 1.5 times of the slave’s part.<br/>
"Only this much? I want to eat more." (Firo)<br/>
"If you want more go hunt it yourself." (Naofumi)<br/>
"Buuuu" (Firo)<br/>
Firo sulks.<br/>
Sorry, but I’ve made pretty large amount. I can’t just cater it to just one person.<br/>
"""Thank you for the meal.""" (The Slaves)<br/>
What? When I was in the middle of chatting with Firo they already eat everything!?<br/>
For the time being they are satisfied.<br/>
"Alright kids, go to bed immediately for tomorrow’s preparation." (Naofumi)<br/>
"…Ye-s." (Slaves)<br/>
I crammed the slaves into one the house that the soldiers from the castle repaired for half a day, and the rest of us went into the house to sleep.<br/>
The house’s windows are still broken; it can be used to defend from the rain but the wind are still blowing in.<br/>
I wonder what I should do for tomorrow’s food.<br/>
"I’ll sleep at the place where everyone is." (Raphtalia)<br/>
"Got it, I’m counting on you to make them used to it even if it’s just for a little bit." (Naofumi)<br/>
"Yes." (Raphtalia)<br/>
Raphtalia leave in order to sleep with her old friends.<br/>
Firo was already half asleep. She began to nodding off<br/>
Rishia are reading a book that she took out of nowhere. She is a hardworking person<br/>
I began compounding for the preparation of my next plan. While at it, I went and checked the level of all slaves. It seem the average level that they raised to is 15。Their status all rise as well. Judging from Raphtalia’s growth pattern, I want to raise the level of them even for those that are unsuitable to combat to at least 30.<br/>
