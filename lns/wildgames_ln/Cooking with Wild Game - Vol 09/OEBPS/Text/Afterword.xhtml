    <p>Thank you, everyone, for purchasing the ninth volume of 『Cooking with Wild Game』.</p>

    <p>The series doesn’t have any specific arcs, but after the 「Forest’s Edge settlement arc」 and 「Genos Post Station Town arc」, we will finally be moving into the 「Pyschkurewuss arc」.</p>

    <p>The denizens of Forest’s Edge, who knew this bastard by name only all the while, will be facing off directly against him.</p>

    <p>That might be so, but the protagonist Asuta is just a chef, and he won’t be trading his kitchen knife for claymore or halberds, and he will just perform the job he is supposed to do.</p>

    <p>And in this volume, more new characters made their debut.</p>

    <p>As Shumimaru’s and Pops Balan’s groups will be leaving Genos, there will be many new characters taking their places.</p>

    <p>All the new characters act independently, but what kind of relationship will they build with Asuta and the denizens? I hope everyone will continue following their story.</p>

    <p>I just received the draft of the non-colored illustration today and saw the designs for Psychuurewuss and the new characters today.</p>

    <p>I have the habit of explaining the fine details, which gives a lot of work to Kochimo-sama. Thanks to his great effort, the finished product is outstanding this time too. I’m very thankful to Kochimo-sama.</p>

    <p>Everyone should have noticed from the title of the mid-meal snack that it is a story about Pops and the southerners.</p>

    <p>I was writing a sweet story about Shin Wu and Lala Wu in the beginning, but I gave up due to the page count and other factors. I hope that I will have the chance to share this story with everyone.</p>

    <p>Pops and his gang have yet to return in the web story yet, and it has been a year and a half since I wrote about them. May the light shine on those middle-aged men.</p>

    <p>Well then, my page count is almost up.</p>

    <p>Actually, the afterword is written in the leftover pages when publishing a book. If I insisted that 「I want to write an even longer afterword!」 it might add 16 more pages, which would be a problem.</p>

    <p>Finally, I will sign off with the usual gratitude towards my editor from HOBBY JAPAN, the illustrator Kochimo-sensei, all the staff who helped in the publishing of this volume, and all the readers who bought this book.</p>

    <p>We will be breaking into two digits in the next volume, let’s meet again then!</p>
