Chapter 357: Undesired Return<br/>
Raphtalia is here.<br/>
I look around the area once more.<br/>
Yep, this isn’t another world. It’s the library of my reality.<br/>
"Um, Naofumi-sama?" (Raphtalia)<br/>
"Shh! This is a place where you have to be quiet. I don’t get what’s going on either, so let me think for a second."<br/>
I tell Raphtalia as such, and look through the Four Holy Weapon’s Manual again.<br/>
… I notice the pages that were once blank start to revise themselves.<br/>
—Having the Hero of the Sword, Spear and Shield, as well as the Hammer Vassal defeated left the Hero of the Bow and his party in despair.<br/>
In the end of the battle, they all faced utmost defeat.<br/>
While the battle raged on, Medea raised a high laugh as she withdrew her forces, who destroyed in the name of fun.<br/>
By the whim of the enemy, their lives had been spared, but those left behind were unable to feel any joy at this fact.<br/>
The losses they faced had been too great.<br/>
It seems that Goddess showed off her advantage by drawing back.<br/>
I wonder what sort of vile development awaits.<br/>
It’s a truly unpleasant feeling. Having that annoying face pop up in my head makes my want to punch something.<br/>
…<br/>
"Oy, what does this mean?" (Naofumi)<br/>
I try talking to the book.<br/>
But the book shows absolutely no signs of action.<br/>
Ku… what should I do?<br/>
"N-Naofumi-sama?"<br/>
"Y-yeah…"<br/>
The book and the bracelet showed no reaction. I tried fiddling with them, but nothing happened.<br/>
Perhaps if I continue doing this in silence, nothing will activate.<br/>
"We won’t be able to talk much here. Let’s move. Follow me. I’ll explain where we are on the way." (Naofumi)<br/>
"Yes." (Raphtalia)<br/>
… How should I explain Raphtalia’s tail and ears?<br/>
Well, I guess I can just say it’s cosplay… right?<br/>
I take the Four Holy Weapons’ Manual in hand, and lead Raphtala to the reception desk.<br/>
Wait a second, can I even borrow this book in the first place?<br/>
I lift the cover, and check all around it.<br/>
Yep, there isn’t a security chip embedded anywhere in it.<br/>
But still, should I try?<br/>
I take out my library card, as well as a random book that was close, before placing them both on the counter. I silently pass them over to the receptionist.<br/>
"Um… this book is…?"<br/>
The receptionist looks all over the book before tilting his head.<br/>
It seems it’s not anything registered to this library.<br/>
"Ah, I’m sorry. I forgot I brought that one from home." (Naofumi)<br/>
I casually take the book back, and successfully finish the borrowing procedure.<br/>
After that, I shoved it into the bag I had brought to the library with me, with all of the other books I borrowed. I led Raphtalia out of the building by the hand.<br/>
After leaving the Library, Raphtalia observes the area with wide eyes.<br/>
The building was in a relatively urban area, so there are many bars and department stores around.<br/>
What’s more, cars and traffic lights… there are plenty of things she wouldn’t have seen over there. Her reaction is natural.<br/>
"Naofumi-sama, where exactly are we?" (Raphtalia)<br/>
"Yeah, it seems… we’re in my world." (Naofumi)<br/>
"Eh!?" (Raphtalia)<br/>
What was reflected in my eyes was the usual cityscape surrounding the library.<br/>
Is it just my imagination that the quality of air seems to have gotten worse?<br/>
I guess the air over there was clearer.<br/>
It’s the familiar world I longed for, but…<br/>
"For some reason, Raphtalia, I’ve returned to this world with you. In order to organize the situation, please just quietly follow me." (Naofumi)<br/>
"Y-yes! So this is Naofumi-sama’s world." (Raphtalia)<br/>
She restlessly looks around as she walks behind me.<br/>
Random passersby are taking quick glances at her.<br/>
So her ears and tail really do stand out?<br/>
No, more importantly, Raphtlaia’s face may be what they’re focusing on.<br/>
That’s Japan’s good point. Even if something looks strange, they just let it pass.<br/>
(TL: You can pretty much explain anything away by, ‘Because Japan’)<br/>
As I think that, I notice my stomach is empty.<br/>
… There’s money in my wallet.<br/>
I crave Junk Food.<br/>
I’ve heard that once you go overseas, you begin to crave the taste of home, but perhaps this is the same.<br/>
It’s because the food over there didn’t have much taste.<br/>
I used to prefer foods with thick flavor, but I simply didn’t have the necessary spices.<br/>
"Okay!" (Naofumi)<br/>
Let’s go to a restaurant.<br/>
I drag Raphtalia along with me as I step into a family restaurant.<br/>
Perhaps I should have taken her to the ones in the mall to see her reaction.<br/>
This time, I just brought us to a Chain Restaurant called Storm.<br/>
"Welcome, how many will we be serving today?"<br/>
"Two." (Naofumi)<br/>
"Two, is it? Then this way please."<br/>
The host leads us, and we take our seats.<br/>
Raphtalia seems to be restless, but she doesn’t seem all too shocked.<br/>
"Um, what sort of store is this?" (Raphtalia)<br/>
"Can’t you tell?" (Naofumi)<br/>
"No, I understand it’s a show that sells food, but you told me to silently follow you, and it ended up being for lunch…" (Raphtalia)<br/>
"That’s right… even so, I need time to think. I’m also hungry, so I thought we would stop by for food." (Naofumi)<br/>
"Understood. I’d like to try the food of your world." (Raphtalia)<br/>
"Then here’s a menu. Order whatever you want." (Naofumi)<br/>
"Ah, yes! Wow, is there a slim projection crystal stuck onto it?" (Raphtalia)<br/>
Fumu… now that I think about it, that world had quite strange technological advancements.<br/>
Projection Crystals would be equated to something like 3D Holograms here, right?<br/>
Well, the immobile ones are just pictures, so… no, perhaps a painting?<br/>
"You won’t call it a simple drawing?" (Naofumi)<br/>
"Hmm? But isn’t it really detailed? There was a painter among the Lemos, but I feel there’s something fundamentally different about this one…" (Raphtalia)<br/>
Ah, so it’s like that.<br/>
In that world there were oil and water based paints, as well as magic ways of coloring. There were plenty of ways to make an image.<br/>
It’s not as if they didn’t have a realist movement, but those weren’t that high in numbers…<br/>
More than a painting, it’s quicker to just call it a photo. And for that purpose, a Projection Crystal fits best.<br/>
"Then this one." (Raphtalia)<br/>
"Can you read the name?" (Naofumi)<br/>
"No…" (Raphtalia)<br/>
So she can’t read the language.<br/>
Spoken words will get taken care of through her vassal, but writing is a bit…<br/>
And wait, if that was possible, I wouldn’t have had so much trouble in that world.<br/>
I press the button to call the waiter, and make my order.<br/>
"You just pushed a button to call him, right? Is this a high class eatery?" (Raphtalia)<br/>
If you think about it, Raphtalia’s been to local restaurants countless times in that world, so she isn’t giving that much of a reaction.<br/>
And it’s not like there weren’t any places where you had to ring a bell to call the server.<br/>
Though we rarely ever went into restaurants of that high a class.<br/>
"This is normal, even for my world’s commoners." (Naofumi)<br/>
"Is that so? T-that’s quite amazing…" (Raphtalia)<br/>
Well, I wonder if Raphtalia’s reaction is wrong.<br/>
"Outside, cars like the ones in Faubley are going at speeds faster than Firo." (Raphtalia)<br/>
Raphtalia expresses her thoughts as she gazes at the street outside the window.<br/>
Well, it’s true that a car’s speed is faster than Firo.<br/>
But that bird’s full speed is much higher.<br/>
When she’s boosted with Aura, it goes even further, and on curved and uneven roads, she can continue without dropping speed.<br/>
In that sense, the bird is more versatile than the car.<br/>
We should install one Filo Rial Queen per house.<br/>
"The bigger ones can even carry more things than her." (Naofumi)<br/>
"W-wow." (Raphtalia)<br/>
"Well, it’s a matter of carrying capacity, so if we do something about the size, Firo should be able to carry it." (Naofumi)<br/>
And while we were engaging in pointless conversation, the food came.<br/>
That was fast.<br/>
No… here, this was normal.<br/>
Raphtalia was also startled at the speed of the food.<br/>
"Thank you for waiting~."<br/>
The waiter puts the items we ordered on the table.<br/>
What’s laid out before me is the nostalgic taste of my world.<br/>
Ah… just how many times have you appeared in my dreams? I begin eating with knife and fork.<br/>
"Thank you for the food. Um, I believe the food Naofumi-sama makes is better." (Raphtalia)<br/>
"I don’t need the flattery." (Naofumi)<br/>
"That’s not what I meant… I think that this food is tasty, but the flavor is too deep." (Raphtalia)<br/>
I mean, it’s not like I used to many spices in that world.<br/>
I’ve been told that foods with unfamiliar tastes are good.<br/>
But there was nothing I could do about the simple flavor.<br/>
In truth, I hear that many of the younger generation of this world cares not for nutrition.<br/>
But for me, that’s irrelevant.<br/>
As I think upon those lines, the taste of hamburger fills my mouth.<br/>
"…"<br/>
To be honest, it wasn’t really that good.<br/>
But for some reason, the first hamburger steak I had in half a year was the best I’d ever tasted.<br/>
We finish filling our stomachs, and leave.<br/>
… As I was leaving the family restaurant, a burger joint caught my eye.<br/>
"Okay, let’s go there too." (Naofumi)<br/>
"You plan to eat more?" (Raphtalia)<br/>
"I’m just savoring the taste of my home." (Naofumi)<br/>
I was full, but the nostalgia whetted my appetite.<br/>
And with ¥500, you can eat quite a bit.<br/>
Right now’s not the time to think about my financial situation, and if it’s just that much, I can spend it.<br/>
"Now onwards, Raphtalia!" (Naofumi)<br/>
"Y-yes!" (Raphtalia)<br/>
And so I ate burgers, and whatever looked interesting until I was satisfied…<br/>
I ate too much… I feel sick.<br/>
"So this is the taste of Naofumi-sama’s home town." (Raphtalia)<br/>
"Pretty much." (Naofumi)<br/>
Raphtalia would say it was tasty every time, but in the end, she concluded the taste was too thick.<br/>
I don’t think there’s anything I can do about it, but is it really that bad?<br/>
My saving grace came in the fact that there were many things Raphtalia said she liked in what we ordered.<br/>
She’ll have to get used to the culinary culture over here, so if there isn’t anything she likes, it will be rough.<br/>
Well, take out having a thick flavor is something natural.<br/>
I randomly select a park bench to lower myself onto, before taking the Four Holy Weapons’ Manual out of my Knapsack, and look at it again.<br/>
"Is that the book you read before you were summoned?" (Raphtalia)<br/>
"Yeah, I just flipped through it earlier, but what we’ve done is recorded as well." (Naofumi)<br/>
… But nothing was written after what I read before leaving the library.<br/>
It seems the enemy retreated, but in that world, the only Legendary Hero left is Itsuki.<br/>
There’s Trash, and the other Vassals, as well as Glass, but this will be a hard battle.<br/>
The last scene I saw in that world flashes back in my head.<br/>
No… Even if we remained there, winning would be difficult.<br/>
Honestly, I can’t imagine a scenario where we would stand triumphantly above them.<br/>
Because even now, I don’t understand what it was that caused my loss.<br/>
"U…mu…"<br/>
Even so, I can’t get a grasp of what I should do now.<br/>
I never thought I would find it strange that my status wasn’t in my field of vision.<br/>
And wait, when I had felt something was off earlier, it was the feel of the air. Something’s different.<br/>
It’s like… something that was supposed to be there naturally had completely vanished.<br/>
What should I compare it to? I can only say it’s a peculiarity in that world’s air.<br/>
"Naofumi-sama…"<br/>
Raphtalia’s looking at me with a worried expression.<br/>
In order to prevent her from standing out, her clothing consists of a shirt and jeans.<br/>
You can call it boyish if you want.<br/>
Raphtalia’s hair is long, and her figure isn’t bad, so I think she looks good in them.<br/>
"I don’t have the slightest idea of what the cause was, but we lost. No, it’s more accurate to say we died. By the time I noticed it, we woke up here, in the world I originated from." (Naofumi)<br/>
I show Raphtalia my Shield, which had been converted into a simple strap.<br/>
And in return, Raphtalia showed me her strap-turned hammer.<br/>
"A possibility is that the Hammer and Shield let us escape here as an emergency measure." (Naofumi)<br/>
"But that doesn’t sound correct." (Raphtalia)<br/>
Raphtalia flicks the strap on her arm as she answers.<br/>
Right. It hasn’t been giving any sort of reaction.<br/>
"Well, there’s no point in worrying about it, so let’s continue the conversation. We’ve come to my world, and I don’t know any way to get back." (Naofumi)<br/>
"Yes… because we lost…" (Raphtalia)<br/>
"Yes, it annoys me to no end that we went out like that. So here is a single problem." (Naofumi)<br/>
"What is it?" (Raphtalia)<br/>
"Raphtalia, it’s about your life here. I told you that living in my world would be troublesome, right?" (Naofumi)<br/>
I mean, she is an otherworlder here.<br/>
She doesn’t have an entry in the family registry, and she’ll have problems finding a place to live.<br/>
No matter what happens, I’ll shelter her, but I don’t know how long I’ll be able to do that.<br/>
"Also, it doesn’t seem like anybody said anything about your tail and ears, but if they get found out, it may be dangerous." (Naofumi)<br/>
If they figure out she’s from another world, they may bring her in for investigation.<br/>
I doubt they’ll just go Oh, how wonderful~~. There’s a high chance she’ll be shipped to some research facility somewhere.<br/>
We’ll have to avoid that as best we can.<br/>
"Y-yes." (Raphtalia)<br/>
"Oh, right. Can you use magic? Try to conceal them as best you can." (Naofumi)<br/>
I concentrate my mind, and test to see if I can still use magic.<br/>
… I think Revelation will be impossible.<br/>
"I, The Hero of the Shield, who has understood the origin of power command. Let the legend be read forth once more, and grant all unto him"<br/>
「Zveit Aura」<br/>
Oh? Aura activated.<br/>
A target floats faintly in my field of vision.<br/>
Raphtalia also tries.<br/>
"I, who has understood the origin of power command. Let the truth be read forth once more, let balls of light come forth"<br/>
「Fast Light」<br/>
In Raphtalia’s outstretched hand, a faint ball of light appeared.<br/>
But it was quite a feeble light. It looked as if it would go out at any moment.<br/>
With this, a lighter from the ¥100 would be more reliable.<br/>
"Uu… how should I put it, controlling it has become really difficult." (Raphtalia)<br/>
The light immediately vanished.<br/>
Fumu… I can’t use the Dragon Pulse Order at all, and normal magic’s effect is faint.<br/>
It would be quite romantic to be able to use the magic of another world, but the output is really low.<br/>
It’s probably because the magic power comes from within our bodies, so we can use a little of it. That sounds possible.<br/>
I don’t know if I’ll be able to replenish our internal magic in the first place.<br/>
But mulling over it doesn’t accomplish anything.<br/>
"Anyways, for now…"<br/>
Just think about it.<br/>
There’s nothing I can do. Neither the Four Holy Weapons’ Manual nor the Shield react to my words.<br/>
Just what do you want me to do?<br/>
"Let’s go to my house." (Naofumi)<br/>
"Naofumi-sama’s house?" (Raphtalia)<br/>
"Ah…" (Naofumi)<br/>
"Naofumi-sama? What’s wrong?" (Raphtalia)<br/>
For a bishojo to be adding –sama to my name… isn’t this a bit bad?<br/>
She said it again and again in the restaurant, but now that I think about it, it’s embarrassing.<br/>
I guess this is the proof that we’ve returned to the world of my reality.<br/>
"Raphtalia, while we’re in this world, please don’t call me –sama." (Naofumi)<br/>
"Huh? U-understood." (Raphtalia)<br/>
Raphtalia nodded.<br/>
"N-Naofumi… sa–" (Raphtalia)<br/>
She suddenly cuts herself off as her face is died a deep red.<br/>
"Naofumi-san." (Raphtalia)<br/>
"Yep, that’s fine. Next, it’s about you…" (Naofumi)<br/>
It would be nice if people thought of Raphtalia-san as her nickname, or pen name, or something…<br/>
What sort of name should I… I glance over at Raphtalia.<br/>
Her face make seems quite foreign, and her hair is brown.<br/>
Is she within the range where I can talk people into thinking she’s Japanese?<br/>
No, it’s not like saying she’s a half won’t work, but it’ll be a bit tricky.<br/>
"Should I call you by a fake name, Shigaraki Tanuko, or something?" (Naofumi)<br/>
"Are you sure you’re alright with calling me that?" (Raphtalia)<br/>
Alright with that name? Me?<br/>
Of course not.<br/>
In the first place, Shigaraki just comes from the fact that she’s a Tanuki girl.<br/>
And wait, Tanuko is insulting, isn’t it?<br/>
Though I’m the one who proposed it.<br/>
Ponko, Rafuko… there’s already a Raph-chan.<br/>
"If we get troubled, we’ll think of one. Right now, I think Raphtalia’s fine. Then let’s go." (Naofumi)<br/>
"Y-yes." (Raphtalia)<br/>
We walk through the town before arriving at my house.<br/>
