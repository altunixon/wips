<br/>
I get complaints that my editors don’t get enough work, but when I need editing they’re not online and so I end up doing it myself… *sigh*<br/>
I suppose I could always wait but I guess you readers would prefer to get releases earlier (I know I would)<br/>
Enhancement Methods (Beginning)<br/>
"There’s trouble! The monsters throughout the world have increased in activity, and there’s also been a sudden rise in levels! The villages and towns in the country are in trouble!" (Soldier)<br/>
An injured soldier came into the throne room and reported frantically.<br/>
We’re still in the meeting. Ren and the others have performed a Level Reset at the hourglass and admitted Tact into the country’s jail so he couldn’t escape for the time being, and then joined us.<br/>
They couldn’t hide their astonishment about Glass joining us or the appearance of new land.<br/>
The conversation with Glass still continues. It was at that point.<br/>
"S-speaking of which." (Soldier)<br/>
Gaelion had said the monsters would have an increase in activity after each wave.<br/>
So the thing about the wave conditions becoming more severe was pointing to this sort of situation!<br/>
"What is it?" (Glass)<br/>
"According to the adventurers who just managed to crush them, just by defeating them…. they managed to acquire more experience than they did on Calmira Island." (Soldier)<br/>
Ha… An ordinary adventurer would go no further than 40 at best, and even soldiers could only reach 100.<br/>
That aside, the citizens might be in danger.<br/>
"Release the Hourglass of the Dragon’s Era. Let those who want to Class Up freely do so!" (Naofumi)<br/>
We don’t have the time to choose our personnel.<br/>
Rather, if we don’t raise the levels of all the citizens, they’ll die.<br/>
At the lowest, 100 is the baseline.<br/>
Well, we have Gaelion here so we should manage the country before that.<br/>
How much time would be needed to re-establish the Seven Stars is the issue, but more than that, we first need to measure how much of Glass’s world has assimilated.<br/>
Starting with the after-effects of the battle with Faubley, we’ll be pressed to deal with the waves.<br/>
"What should we do about the waves throughout the world?" (Naofumi)<br/>
"Kue." (Fitoria)<br/>
Fitoria shrinks her carriage.<br/>
And then opens the carriage’s doors for us.<br/>
Various scenes were reflected there.<br/>
It’s a tool I’ve seen before somewhere. Oi. [T/N: "Don’t rip off a certain robotic cat!" (Naofumi)]<br/>
"Er, Fitoria-sama said the Vassal’s carriage has the ability to transport and warp, so it can be used to deal with the waves throughout the world." (Midori)<br/>
"….How convenient." (Naofumi)<br/>
I won’t say we should have done that from the start.<br/>
This is probably one of the abilities of the Vassal of the Carriage.<br/>
Is it a reduction of the Portal Skill’s range expansion and transfer scope….?<br/>
"How long until the next wave?" (Naofumi)<br/>
"About five days."<br/>
…There are less days than I thought.<br/>
However, we have things to do until then.<br/>
"…. Instruct the Allied Forces and the troops throughout the world to try raise at least one level before the time limit so they don’t die and to protect the people of their country." (Trash)<br/>
Trash gave instructions to the soldier.<br/>
What we need to do concerns the one calling himself God, but in order to stop letting him do as he pleases we must be aware about how fast the waves will descend.<br/>
"Glass. What will happen with the next wave?" (Naofumi)<br/>
"The monsters appearing because of the wave are the other world’s screams when the worlds fuse or so I’ve been told. The monsters’ strength won’t lessen but as long as this world’s Saint weapons and Vassals exist, we can buy time." (Glass)<br/>
"Your world is…." (Naofumi)<br/>
Even now, the Four Saints and Vassals of Glass’s world were in a damaged state.<br/>
"I am…. past being resolved. For example, another world might assimilate while we’re trying to hinder the assimilation with this world…. We might be destroyed by some opposing world in the end. I will…. take advantage of the wave and return though." (Glass)<br/>
"You’re not going to stay in this world and fight?" (Naofumi)<br/>
"Because I am a Vassal of that world. Until I accomplish my mission at least." (Glass)<br/>
"I see… by the way, it’s been on my mind but are you going to continually repeat these fights with no end?" (Naofumi)<br/>
Honestly, I can’t see any sign of salvation for them.<br/>
The spirit of the shield sounded like there was an end and that there was salvation.<br/>
Of course, I only managed to get it to tell me the outline of what the waves were but since there’s a reward, there should be an end.<br/>
"I also don’t know the details of that. Just that the spirit of the fan told me. That an end will come eventually for this fight as well. And that even the being pretending to be God has limits." (Glass)<br/>
Until the enemy runs out of patience, we’ll continue to hinder the assimilation.<br/>
No…. Perhaps just like in a siege, the waves might be a fight to wait for allies against an assaulting enemy.<br/>
Like this, we solidified the plan of action against the waves.<br/>
Next is the issue regarding the Saint Weapons and Vassal weapons.<br/>
If we don’t power up all the Saint Weapons and Vassal Weapons, we probably won’t be able to overcome the waves.<br/>
"Can Glass’s fan and our weapons be connected through enhancement methods?" (Naofumi)<br/>
"…It seems like it’s impossible. They’re incompatible in regards to enhancing." (Glass)<br/>
"I see. Then Raphtalia, Firo, the other heroes newly chosen by the vassal weapons, and Fitoria. Check each of your enhancement methods in the help manual and explain them." (Naofumi)<br/>
"Y-yes!" (Raphtalia)<br/>
Beginning with Raphtalia, they each check their own status and help manuals.<br/>
Our weapons had mutual compatibility to convert those processes and operate them.<br/>
With this the Four Saints should unlock the parts released by the Vassal weapons.<br/>
There’s quite a lot but if we don’t listen and test them all we won’t become stronger so it can’t be helped.<br/>
"I suppose I’m first." (Raphtalia)<br/>
Raphtalia raises her hand and explains.<br/>
"Er, the mallet’s enhancement method written in the manual is weapon synthesis." (Raphtalia)<br/>
"Weapon synthesis…." (Naofumi)<br/>
Somehow it has something I can imagine.<br/>
How many will be able to apply this?<br/>
"Apparently it’s about conferring the weapon tree’s most characteristic special ability onto other weapons." (Raphtalia)<br/>
For the time being, let’s go ahead with the enhancement and try experimenting on the Spirit Turtle Shell Shield.<br/>
Spirit Turtle Shell Shield (Awakened) +8 70/70   SR   Blessed (Compassion)<br/>
Ability released…. Equipment bonus, Skills [S Float Shield][Reflect Shield]<br/>
Special Abilities: Gravity Field, C Soul Recovery, C Magic Snatch, C Gravity Shot, Vitality Up, Magic Defence (Large), Lightning Resistance, SP Drain Nullification<br/>
Growing Ability<br/>
Proficiency 100<br/>
Item Enchant Lv8: Defence 10% Up<br/>
Dragon Spirit: Defence 50, Fire resistance up<br/>
Status Enchant: Magic Power 30+<br/>
○　○　○　○　○<br/>
When I checked, ○ icons appeared at the bottom.<br/>
Incidentally, what the Blessed series’ Shield of compassion does to the other shields…. seems to be in a different category to Enchant or Synthesis.<br/>
The Blessed Series can’t enhance but it assimilates with the normal shield and manifests its abilities.<br/>
No matter how weak of a shield it may be, it’s fine to think of it being endowed with a part of the Shield of Compassion.<br/>
For the time being, let’s try endowing this shield with the Soul Eater Shield.<br/>
Ah, the Shield of Compassion has the special ability Spell Support but that has a weaker ability than Trash’s cane.<br/>
But I’ve gone off topic.<br/>
Synthesize the Soul Eater Shield!<br/>
Spirit Turtle Shell Shield (Awakened) +10 70/70   SR+   Blessed (Compassion)<br/>
Ability released…. Equipment bonus, Skills [S Float Shield][Reflect Shield]<br/>
Special Abilities: Gravity Field, C Soul Recovery, C Magic Snatch, C Gravity Shot, Vitality Up, Magic Defence (Large), Lightning Resistance, SP Drain Nullification<br/>
Growing Ability<br/>
Proficiency 100<br/>
Item Enchant Lv8: Defence 10% Up<br/>
Dragon Spirit: Defence 50, Fire resistance up<br/>
Status Enchant: Magic Power 30+<br/>
Soul Eater　○　○　○　○<br/>
So it also increases the Enhancement value and Rarity?<br/>
Ah, Soul Eater Shield’s Enhancement value and Rarity have been reset….<br/>
As a test, I tried synthesizing other shields which had been enhanced but whether it will increase or not depended on the weapon’s strength, and it seemed there were limits.<br/>
So it won’t go that well….<br/>
Or I should say, with this my skill, Reflect Shield, seems like it’s turned into a dead skill but….<br/>
Well, it can still be put to practical use so it’s fine?<br/>
"Naofumi." (Ren)<br/>
"What?" (Naofumi)<br/>
Ren enhanced his weapon many times and then came to address me.<br/>
"It seems there’s a limit to how many times the material weapons can be synthesized like this." (Ren)<br/>
"Is that so?" (Naofumi)<br/>
"Yeah, after using it three times the weapon book entry turned dark. It’s also impossible to alter it." (Ren)<br/>
"….Is it alright?" (Naofumi)<br/>
"It seems I can relight it again as long as I have the materials so there’s no problem. Also, I unlocked a sword because of this." (Ren)<br/>
"Well, I guess it was possible." (Naofumi)<br/>
An image of entrusting a fully enhanced blade to a blacksmith and receiving a famous roguelike weapon comes to mind.<br/>
Or rather, did synthesizing to a specific rule turn it into the strongest sword?<br/>
"So it’s one week of synthesis as I expected?" (Naofumi?)<br/>
"What are you talking about?" (Ren)<br/>
"No, it was on Monday or Tuesday.." (Naofumi?)<br/>
"The sword I experimented on was the one that appeared when I combined the Dragon slaying sword." (Ren)<br/>
"Ah, that one?" (Naofumi)<br/>
Ren showed the transformed sword he was experimenting with.<br/>
Oh, there was an incredibly pretty ornament added on the sword. A dragon scale glittered, it looked cool.<br/>
"The disappointing part is its basic attack power is lower than the spirit turtle sword and my fighting partner, Gaelion seems to hate it." (Ren)<br/>
Taniko glared with all her heart. She’s angry since he possessed the sword that killed her father, huh.<br/>
"You might be able to use it after raising its level so isn’t it fine?" (Naofumi)<br/>
"Well.…I guess." (Ren)<br/>
Let’s not go into why he synthesized together only swords that were effective against dragons.<br/>
I see, so the mallet was a vassal weapon with a smithing aspect.<br/>
…..I wonder why it chose Raphtalia?<br/>
"What’s wrong?" (Raphtalia)<br/>
A mallet for Raphtalia…. A hammer, huh.<br/>
I wonder if Raphtalia would get angry and change it to a 1 tonne hammer and hit me with it if I went on a date with the villagers.<br/>
"You’re thinking about something strange again." (Raphtalia)<br/>
"Don’t hit me with that." (Naofumi)<br/>
"Why must I be hitting Naofumi-sama with the mallet! Or will you be doing something that I would hit you for?" (Raphtalia)<br/>
"I thought it might be possible in the middle of doing various things with the villagers or Melty." (Naofumi)<br/>
"I won’t! Haven’t we spoken properly about this!" (Raphtalia)<br/>
"Well, I suppose so." (Naofumi)<br/>
I’m thinking too much, huh.<br/>
Or I should say, it probably fits Raphtalia perfectly, her having a straight-man disposition.<br/>
Let’s have Imia’s Uncle make the PikoPiko Hammer and let her copy it. [T/N: Squeaky Hammer]<br/>
Then… it probably won’t hurt, and I’ll be careful to never let her turn it into a 1 tonne hammer.<br/>
"You’re still thinking something…." (Raphtalia)<br/>
Raphtalia completely suspects me.<br/>
"Now then~ let’s move on!" (Naofumi)<br/>
It would be bothersome in various ways so I diverted the conversation.<br/>
<br/>
