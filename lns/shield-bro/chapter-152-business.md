Chapter 152, done by Muel, with the untranslated portions filled in by me… Let me say this now. It takes me longer to edit/complete than to translate, so I don’t think I will be doing this again… I didn’t edit the whole thing, just kinda did the glaring errors, and missing portions. BTW, I might try to pick up Konjiki no Word Master as well.<br/>
EXTREME EDITING BY uz3r013<br/>
Chapter 152: Business<br/>
In the Neighboring town, a magic, medicine, and clothing shop have now been built.<br/>
They’re still working from temporary stands, but business has already started.<br/>
"Ah, Hero-sama. welcome."(Magic Shopkeeper)<br/>
The Magic Shop’s owner greets me<br/>
The building she is working out of obviously isn’t as good as her previous shop, but I have been giving her some preferential treatment.<br/>
I have high hopes for this town even though we have just started reconstruction efforts on it.<br/>
"How are you faring?" (Naofumi)<br/>
"I’m getting by. I think I will reopen the store in the Castle Town as well." (Magic Shopkeeper)<br/>
"So this will just be a branch location?"(Naofumi)<br/>
"Yeah. I’ll work here until that store opens and I’ll occasionally be teaching magic there…… It seems you’re doing something interesting there as well, right?" (Magic Shopkeeper)<br/>
The Magic shopkeeper seems to have noticed the sudden change in my village.<br/>
This kind of progress is certainly in itself worthy of being called magic.<br/>
"…… Hmph" (Naofumi)<br/>
I think I can probably smell the Medicine-shop.<br/>
Sometimes my gaze turns toward the village.<br/>
"We can research advanced medicine now that the Medicine-shop has begun taking care of it. I am looking forward to the results and would like to thank you for helping me since my schedule has become rather tight" (Naofumi)<br/>
"…..I see" (Medicine Shopkeeper)<br/>
"Now….. Where is the clothing shop?" (Naofumi)<br/>
"I wonder if I’ve made a mistake. I was under the impression I would be living in the Hero’s village." (Tailor)<br/>
Fumu…. I give the various monster materials I had gathered to the Tailor.<br/>
I had told her that I would give her various interesting materials.<br/>
I think I can leave the sizing of the materials up to her.<br/>
"There has also been a lot of reconstruction happening here" (Naofumi)<br/>
Unlike my village, this one has a lot of manpower, so I see lots of progress every day.<br/>
There seems to be a plan to re-built the Feudal lord’s house.<br/>
Currently the foundations have been erected, and they plan for it to be finished in two weeks.<br/>
"Sorry for many thing" (Naofumi)<br/>
"No problem. Most of the people here had a lot of free time on their hands anyways."(Leader)<br/>
"I see" (Naofumi)<br/>
"Instead of hating you, everyone is looking forward to your cooking. Is it really as tasty as they say? I too would like to partake in it at least once."(Leader)<br/>
…I would occasionally come over and cook food to support their efforts, but has that become their motivation?<br/>
The shield really does prepare good food.<br/>
"Well good. Also, I won’t be cooking again until I return from peddling." (Naofumi)<br/>
"Okay, I’ll pass on the message."(Leader)<br/>
"yes yes" (Naofumi)<br/>
I shake his hand, and set out to start peddling in the next town.<br/>
I am accompanied by Rafatalia, Firo and two other people.<br/>
There is a need for me to increase my combat forces and I’m not sure if Rat will be able to produce results in the given time.<br/>
On the second day of Peddling<br/>
I arrived in a big town.<br/>
"Hm?" (Naofumi)<br/>
There is a commotion going on involving a squadron of Guards<br/>
I should probably ignore it, but…..<br/>
"Why are these people getting off Scot Free, while I have to be taken into custody?!" (a familiar voice)<br/>
when approaching i stop the carriage because the voice I heard sounded very familiar.<br/>
I can’t see through the crowd, so I ask someone nearby.<br/>
"What’s happening?" (Naofumi)<br/>
"It seems that the Hero of the Sword helped capture a thief, but now he is being arrested." (Crowd Person)<br/>
…It’s a story I have heard somewhere before.<br/>
"Hm? Aren’t you the Hero of the Shield?" (Crowd Person)<br/>
So I have been noticed. Well, my carriage does stand out quite a bit, and Firo is in her monster form, so this much is to be expected.<br/>
The crowd are breaking and ringleader comes into view.<br/>
There, I see a familiar group of thieves with smiling faces, and Ren being held down by some guards.<br/>
…I kinda understand the situation.<br/>
Capturing thieves. Something similar happened to me before.<br/>
There’s no choice. I make my way through the crowd.<br/>
"Yo." (Naofumi)<br/>
Surprising them would be dangerous, so I call out from a distance.<br/>
"It’s Naofumi isn’t it?" (Ren)<br/>
"Been a while." (Naofumi)<br/>
Ren looks happy upon seeing me. He waves his hand at me.<br/>
But the person I was talking to was not Ren, but the leader of the thieves.<br/>
As soon as the thieves see me, they begin to look pale.<br/>
Well… they’ve already gone through this twice. This will be the third.<br/>
These people, They should really learn to live honestly, maybe become mercenaries or something.<br/>
"You people really don’t learn, do you. Did you really think that framing the person that apprehended you would really get you off so easily?" (Naofumi)<br/>
"S-shut up!" (Thief)<br/>
There’s something I would like to test.<br/>
They may be a little afraid of me, but I haves something that gives them nightmares.<br/>
"Firo"(Naofumi)<br/>
"Yes?"(Firo)<br/>
Firo come up by jumping over the crowd.<br/>
The bandit’s face became paler.<br/>
"Enjoy your meal." (Naofumi)<br/>
"Yup" (Firo)<br/>
It seems she will eat anything that is not a child.<br/>
The thieves desperately face the guards and begin to beg to them.<br/>
"We are the culprits, Please Help!" (Bandits)<br/>
They confessed… Is Firo really that scary?<br/>
Well Rat did tell me that Filo Rials are supposedly very vicious, and this happens to be a Queen.<br/>
"No, these people aren’t thieves. The Hero of the Sword is mistaken." (Naofumi)<br/>
It seems the guards have yet to discover their hideout.<br/>
These people have a bit of skill, and they’re good at saving up money.<br/>
I think I’ll make them a source of income again.<br/>
"Naofumi! You too!?" (Ren)<br/>
"I’m not saying you’re at fault. Just be quiet for a second. I have an idea." (Naofumi)<br/>
"We’ll talk! We’ll talk, so just keep that man’s bird away from us!" (Bandits)<br/>
"Hey, master. Firo feels that she is being hated, but did Firo do something wrong?" (Firo)<br/>
"I think that the fact that you’ll eat anything other than a child is fundamentally wrong." (Naofumi)<br/>
"Mu…" (Firo)<br/>
I can hear the crowd whispering.<br/>
"That Holy Bird eats people?" (Crowd)<br/>
"Nah, I hear the Hero of the Shield is quite skilled at deceit." (Crowd)<br/>
"Really? As I thought. I once saw the Holy Bird playing peacefully with children in the Castle Town." (Crowd)<br/>
That’s good, Firo. You haven’t become a public symbol of fear.<br/>
It’s up to her whether she gets treated as a human or a monster.<br/>
"That’s how it is. Those people once tried the same stunt with me when I had a notoriously bad reputation. Please make sure to wring them dry." (Naofumi)<br/>
"W-what?" (Guards)<br/>
The guards are taken aback.<br/>
"These people’s bounties, will you give them to me?" (Naofumi)<br/>
"Y-yes, but we haven’t caught their leader." (Guard)<br/>
"Hey, where’s your base." (Naofumi)<br/>
"Yes! Please bring out a map!" (Bandit)<br/>
They’re being quite cooperative.<br/>
"Firo and Rafatalia, go catch the guys hiding there." (Naofumi)<br/>
"Yup!" (Firo)<br/>
"Understood." (Rafatalia)<br/>
I pass the map to Rafatalia and Fiol, and they set off.<br/>
"The rest of you, keep peddling" (Naofumi)<br/>
"Yes" (anon slaves)<br/>
I walk through the crowd towards my carriage.<br/>
"The Hero of the Shield handled the situation." (Crowd)<br/>
"Amazing. He got the bandits to confess by himself." (Crowd)<br/>
"He must be really strong." (Crowd)<br/>
"Yeah." (Crowd)<br/>
For the love of…<br/>
Even if they speak the truth, I don’t really want unnecessary abilities tacked onto my reputation.<br/>
"well, hasn’t it been a long time, Ren" (Naofumi)<br/>
"ah, ah……" (Ren)<br/>
Ren slowly distances himself from me, while looking vigilant.<br/>
"wait wait, Ignoring that, I don’t have any intention to catch you. I just want to hear your story" (Naofumi)<br/>
"I see… Everyone I’ve met so far has been suspicious of me. I’ve even had random people throw stones at me." (Ren)<br/>
Ren answer defiantly.<br/>
I think it’s fine if it’s only at that level.<br/>
In my case, I was literally treated as the devil<br/>
The cause of all that was Trash, Bitch and the Three Hero Church.<br/>
"For now, should we go to the tavern and talk?" (Naofumi)<br/>
I take Ren to the tavern. I notice some people from the crowd follow us there, but I don’t really care.<br/>
I sat at the bar counter, and order a drink.<br/>
Along with my drink, I am also given a real Lucor fruit.<br/>
The boss of the tavern looks at me with eyes full of expectation.<br/>
There’s no choice. I eat the fruit whole.<br/>
"The Real one!" (Boss)<br/>
"Unbelievable" (some guys)<br/>
My identity has been confirmed by all.<br/>
It’s quite a strange identification test.<br/>
"It seems you’ve been through a lot." (Naofumi)<br/>
I talk to Ren without any ulterior motives.<br/>
It seems that he’s been alone and being chased without knowing the exact reason why.<br/>
When I was alone, before I met Rafatalia and Firo, the only thing I could think of was revenge.<br/>
"Yeah… the guild said they were no longer accepting Heroes, I wasn’t able to slay monsters freely anymore, and I couldn’t claim bounties. Then, to top it all off, this had to happen!" (Ren)<br/>
Self-proclaimed cool Ren began to angerly complain.<br/>
But it’s not like I don’t see where he’s coming from.<br/>
"So I began selling monster drops and began to live day by day… It got really annoying. Everyone I meet seems to turn on me. Why do I even have to defend this crappy world?" (Ren)<br/>
"That’s just how humans are. When I was called the Devil of the Shield, I was treated the same way. No, I was treated worse than you, you know." (Naofumi)<br/>
"I-I see…" (Ren)<br/>
"First, let me ask. Were you involved in Spirit Turtle incident?" (Naofumi)<br/>
Now that I think about it, his party members are nowhere to be seen.<br/>
Did they run away on him?<br/>
Well, I think they’ll do just fine without him though. If he’s been cut off, he can’t really complain.<br/>
"No… that’s…" (Ren)<br/>
Ren suddenly begins stumbling over his words.<br/>
"So you’re going to avoid the topic?"(Naofumi)<br/>
"No, it’s not…"(Ren)<br/>
As usually this guy.<br/>
His insociability is getting on my nerves.<br/>
I have some grudges against this person, but he has done me enough favors to balance it out.<br/>
"I am still thankful for that time during the failed attempt to kill Melty. I’ll listen to what you have to say, just as you did for me. I always make sure to return a favor." (Naofumi)<br/>
"……….." (Ren)<br/>
"Ren If you don’t say it, your position will become worse. You’ll become the next Demon of the Shield." (Naofumi)<br/>
"…. I understand. I’ll tell you my story." (Ren)<br/>
Ren sighs, and begins to speak.<br/>
