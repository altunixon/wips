Epilogue<br/>
<br/>
──Inside Porter, Aria’s face was white as a sheet.<br/>
She was wrapped in a blanket and lied down on a bench.<br/>
Even though she was in a normal health until before the departure, her condition suddenly worsened.<br/>
At the opposite side Miranda was also similarly suffering with a bad complexion.<br/>
「……It’s painful. In addition I feel bad and sluggish.」<br/>
Miranda’s health also crumbled at the same period.<br/>
The speaking voices of Lyle and Shannon came from the ceiling.<br/>
Right now she didn’t even have the composure to care about other things, so she was wrapped in a blanket and tried to sleep but…….<br/>
「Haa, my stomach is empty. Besides there is nothing to do. Eva-san, please sing something.」<br/>
「Wait, don’t touch my hair with that dirty hand! Hey! Don’t wipe your hand on my clothes!」<br/>
Sophia was noisy since some time ago.<br/>
She pulled at Eva’s hair and pestered for song. She said that she was hungry, but she had been continuing to eat snacks since some time ago. She wiped her dirty hands on other people’s clothes.<br/>
This action of Sophia normally was absolutely impossible to happen, but she entered the pre-Growth’s poor health earlier than Aria and Miranda. And then this morning she recovered.<br/>
Sophia right now was in the post-Growth state.<br/>
Her tension was higher than usual and even though she was normally a serious and diligent person, she became slovenly at this kind of time.<br/>
She captured Monica in the morning, made her create something that looked like a robe made from blanket, and wore that.<br/>
It was also distinctive of her how she continued to eat something all the time since breakfast.<br/>
「H~m, this is troubling. Novem-san and Clara-san are at the driver seat, if it’s like this let’s ask Monica-san to keep her company.」<br/>
Monica who was called by name was making a face that looked displeased from the bottom of her heart.<br/>
「……I’m busy so please don’t get me involved with that.」<br/>
Monica was angry.<br/>
The reason was due to the sweets Sophia ate and the incomprehensible clothes that was unclear whether it was a robe or a blanket that she was wearing.<br/>
「She took away the blanket that I prepared for chicken dickwad’s sake and even devoured all the sweets that I made in order to satisfy chicken dickwad’s stomach, this damn parasite! I’m busy with the preparation of cooking food and sweets at the next break time right now.」<br/>
(So she didn’t make Monica create that clothes, but she stole what Monica was creating. No wonder she’s angry.)<br/>
Sophia laughed flippantly.<br/>
「It’s fine isn’t it? Lyle-dono also said that I can use this. The blanket will be warm when it’s used after getting warmed by my skin.」<br/>
「Haa? Making chicken dickwad wear the clothes that has been used by you? No way. As soon as I finished preparing, this Monica will prepare a new one.」<br/>
「Ee~, Lyle-dono too surely will love the warmth of human skin. Ah, I get it. It’ll be better for us to warm the blanket together.」<br/>
「Shut up you blanket woman! Warming chicken dickwad is also my job!」<br/>
Eva was exasperated listening to the conversation of the two.<br/>
「Is it always like this?」<br/>
Aria didn’t really want to talk, but because Miranda wasn’t saying anything she could only reply.<br/>
「Yeah. It’s always like this.」<br/>
「It looks fun with how boisterous they are.」<br/>
Aria had no composure to perceive the words that were said in exasperation as sarcasm.<br/>
「Yes, it’s fun. It’s always fun, so please let me sleep.」<br/>
Aria covered her head under her blanket. Seeing that Eva shook her.<br/>
「Wait. I’ll be troubled if you sleep! Sophia has been pulling at my hair since some time ago!」<br/>
This time it seemed Sophia got curious with her ears.<br/>
「An Elf’s ear is long.」<br/>
「Ouch! Wait, that hurts so don’t pull!」<br/>
Aria closed her eyes under the blanket.<br/>
(Aa……I don’t want to do anything.)<br/>
Inside the vehicle Sophia caused trouble while Eva and Monica were making a ruckus. It was lively──<br/>
.<br/>
The subjugation force left the town.<br/>
The corpses of the Hippogriff that were the proof of the subjugation were put on horse cart.<br/>
The other monsters were burned with only their magic stones and expensive body parts stripped off.<br/>
Only the Griffon got its whole corpse stored inside the Seventh’s Art──Box.<br/>
When we stopped marching and took a somewhat long break, I went outside and surveyed the surrounding.<br/>
I caught sight of Lionel muttering to himself in a low voice.<br/>
「That guy, has he been alone this whole time?」<br/>
Shannon beside me spoke with a voice that was slightly filled with pity.<br/>
「Lionel’s friend told me, it looks like his condition is strange after his growth. Apparently he has been like that all this time.」<br/>
Even though people normally would be in high tension post-growth, he was grumbling in low voice to himself repeatedly instead with a face as though the world had ended. His friends also thought of his as eerie and took distance from him.<br/>
And then, even now he was muttering to himself.<br/>
「……Did something happen?」<br/>
「U~n, he only got reality taught to him?」<br/>
When Shannon said that, voices came from the Jewel.<br/>
『Reality is sometimes harsh after all.』<br/>
『Shannon might have told him something painful.』<br/>
『This girl is even more immature than her appearance after all.』<br/>
『However, he’s really a pathetic guy.』<br/>
『I agree but, I can’t say that this is a really good trend.』<br/>
Would it be alright if I called out to him? However, he hated me so he might get obstinate and wouldn’t listen.<br/>
「Shannon, did you say something horrible to him?」<br/>
「Eh? Why’s that, I only told him that Otou-sama has no intention of making him the heir. Come to think of it, I also told him that Lyle has no intention of being the heir of a Viscount house.」<br/>
Lionel thought that he would be able to marry into the Circry House if he could obtain achievements in the Hippogriff subjugation. Surely he would be hurt if he knew that it was a lie.<br/>
「Isn’t he hurt because of your fault then?」<br/>
「How rude. Because, it’s pitiful that he got tricked like that.」<br/>
The Fourth listened to my conversation with Shannon and concluded something.<br/>
『……Lyle, the cause also lies with you.』<br/>
When I grasped the Jewel, the Third taught me.<br/>
『It’s humiliating that Lyle who he thought as a rival isn’t even interested with the position that he desires. What’s more, Lyle knew about the truth when he didn’t. In Lionel-kun’s position that’s something that caused his pride to be torn apart.』<br/>
……Eh? Was I in the wrong?<br/>
Then what should I do?<br/>
I thought if perhaps I ought to say something to him, but the Sixth made fun of me by saying 『Do you plan to finish him off?』 so I stopped.<br/>
Sophia-san jumped down from Porter’s back.<br/>
It seemed she was pleased with the robe that was made from blanket. She got out in that appearance.<br/>
Shannon was,<br/>
「Uwaa~, she came out.」<br/>
Both Shannon and I approached Sophia-san. We had to immediately pushed her back inside Porter.<br/>
「Sophia-san, you have to be inside. What are Monica and Eva-san doing?」<br/>
Sophia-san smiled.<br/>
She embraced my arm with a smile.<br/>
「So the two of you are outside~. Lyle-dono is warm. I’m also warm so let’s hug each other.」<br/>
Just what was she saying outside like this?<br/>
「Shannon, we’ll push her back into Porter right away.」<br/>
「I, I get it.」<br/>
The two of us forcefully dragged Sophia-san until inside Porter.<br/>
「Please wait~. I want to play outside. Monica-san said that she’ll cook outside. It’ll be rude to not snitch some food.」<br/>
Shannon showed interest at the words snitching food.<br/>
「Monica is? It’ll be rude to not quickly snitch those foods. Lyle, let’s go play for a bit.」<br/>
You didn’t want to play but just want to snitch food.<br/>
「Just for a bit okay?」<br/>
When I allowed them to go to Monica’s place, they hugged me.<br/>
「Hooray~」<br/>
「Come on, let’s go quickly Lyle.」<br/>
While we started walking like that, a space was created on the breast of Sophia-san who was hugging my arm and I could see the inside……this person, she was naked under the blanket.<br/>
She was wearing shoes, but she was stark naked underneath.<br/>
「Sophia-san!」<br/>
「Yes?」<br/>
「Wh, why are you, under, underneath!」<br/>
「H~m? Aah, you mean this. It’s texture is pleasant so」<br/>
I wished she wouldn’t wear baggy clothes because of such reason. I forcefully dragged Sophia-san towards Porter.<br/>
「Lyle-dono, what about the food?」<br/>
「I’ll bring it to you later so please stay inside. Shannon, you help out too!」<br/>
「Why?」<br/>
Shannon who didn’t know the state Sophia-san was in tilted her head in puzzlement.<br/>
.<br/>
──Lionel was sitting during the break while muttering to himself in a low voice.<br/>
The surroundinga was taking distance from him who was acting like that.<br/>
「……I was always made fun of since I was little. Even though the feudal lord Walt House is a Count, the capital noble Walt House is jobless and at the lowest rank that we got laughed at. The branch house is impertinent even though our house is the main house. That’s what my family said so I thought that’s also the case.」<br/>
The superior branch house, and the main house that didn’t change at all.<br/>
They were laughed at by the surroundings.<br/>
「Why do I have to go through something like this. Even though my house is the main house. Even though the other side is the branch house……」<br/>
Lionel continued to speak out what he was thinking, but there wasn’t anyone to listen to his voice.<br/>
「I see. That’s right. Things like main house or branch house are irrelevant. It’s irrelevant. Which one is superior, that’s the only important thing.」<br/>
Lionel looked down and laughed. His face wasn’t decent.<br/>
He hid his face that was dyed with madness and continued talking to himself.<br/>
「Then, it’ll be fine if I just become stronger than Lyle. If I do that, I’ll be able to knock around Lyle and make him realize which of us is superior. I’m the superior one. That’s right, it’s obvious that I’m absolutely in the right.」<br/>
The lowest rank of capital noble.<br/>
For Lionel, Lyle……the feudal lord Walt House was a house that ought to be hated.<br/>
Although it was mostly unjustified resentment, for the person himself it was something right.<br/>
Lyle who was compared to himself was amazing.<br/>
While he was living as a hanger-on of a woman with high status in the capital, Lyle was earning a lot of money and being surrounded by beautiful women.<br/>
The eldest son of a branch house. An idiot son who was driven out of his house. Lionel lost against someone who he thought to be like that.<br/>
He was made to realize that he was overwhelmingly inferior that he went mad.<br/>
The answer that he arrived at in his madness was,<br/>
「I’ll absolutely surpass Lyle. I’ll make him realize which one of us is right. If it’s in order to do that……I’ll do anything.」<br/>
He would win against Lyle no matter what kind of method he used──<br/>
.<br/>
The day when Sophia-san made a ruckus after her Growth was coming to an end.<br/>
Night. I was lying down inside Porter and sent my consciousness into the Jewel.<br/>
The second weapon floating there was shining.<br/>
The silver bow that the Second left behind could become both a short bow or a longbow. It was an excellent weapon that fired arrows of light. And perhaps it had serious personality like the Second, it wouldn’t suck all my mana.<br/>
It was an obedient weapon that was easy to use.<br/>
The silver great sword floating beside it would rampage just from me holding it and took away a lot of my mana.<br/>
The two weapons were like total opposites──they were similar to the First and the Second.<br/>
And then, that that weapon was here showed that the Second was gone from this place.<br/>
I was scared to come inside the Jewel since then.<br/>
After fighting the Griffon, I never came inside the Jewel even once until today.<br/>
There was only the Third inside the room of the round table.<br/>
He was sitting on his chair while staring at the bow.<br/>
『Oh, have you finally made your resolve?』<br/>
The Third teased me. It seemed he wasn’t angry.<br/>
「……I, don’t know what I should say.」<br/>
I was reluctant to part with the Second and it resulted in the worst parting. The Second vanished without me being able to face him properly. It made me felt apologetic.<br/>
『I don’t know what you are misunderstanding, but Tou-san and I aren’t angry with Lyle. I don’t know about the others but, we were happy.』<br/>
「Happy?」<br/>
『At the end the Second──Tou-san was able to see Luka-kun getting saved. If Lyle inherited the Art right away, Tou-san wouldn’t be unable to meet Luka. Thanks to you Tou-san could meet Luka, and then he was able to see his life saved. In that moment, perhaps Tou-san saw Dewy-niisan being saved overlapping with that scene. He looked happy.』<br/>
It was good based on the outcome. My heart lightened just for a bit hearing the Third saying that.<br/>
『Besides there’s no need to weigh your mind with it. We’re memories. The people themselves have died since a long time ago, and our role is in order to teach Lyle our Arts. It’s not good to worry about us too much.』<br/>
「……I was unable to say farewell properly at the end.」<br/>
『You regret it? But, Tou-san said his thanks to Lyle. Thank you, he said. He also said that if it’s you Lyle you will be alright.』<br/>
I could hear the words that I would be fine if it was me.<br/>
I could hear it but……I wanted to properly face the person himself.<br/>
「I refused to inherit the Art due to my selfishness, and because of that I was unable to properly say thanks to the Second.」<br/>
Tears spilled out.<br/>
『It’s enough. Lyle’s feelings had been conveyed enough to Tou-san. That’s why, it’s alright.』<br/>
The parting with the First was sudden.<br/>
The parting with the Second was……I thought that we would be able to be together forever if I failed. But, it didn’t go well…….<br/>
『Lyle, remember this. I, we have reason to exist. We intend to accomplish our role.』<br/>
「……Yes.」<br/>
『I don’t mean that we want to part with you quickly. But you see, it’s unnatural for us to stay here forever and getting involved with Lyle’s life.』<br/>
Was it an indulgence to want them to watch over me?<br/>
『We’ll talk to you if we think it’s fine to accomplish our role and vanish, and it’ll be fine too if Lyle yourself talk to us for that. But, we won’t be able to stay at your side forever.』<br/>
「……Why?」<br/>
『That’s what it means to stand on your own. It’s fine even if it’s not right away but, it’s better if you resolved yourself beforehand. Originally, we’re people who won’t be able to meet each other.』<br/>
The Third smiled when I nodded.<br/>
『Good boy. Even so, I hardly recognize you with when we first met. You’re still naïve and unreliable but, it’s a world of difference compared to the time when we first met.』<br/>
He returned to the usual Third.<br/>
「Wa, was I that terrible?」<br/>
Certainly it was terrible but, for there to be a world of difference……was I that terrible?<br/>
『No, you were completely no good. There was a lot of shocking things even when I’m recalling it right now. Even so, various things happened at the case this time.』<br/>
I participated in a Hippogriff subjugation, but what came out was a Griffon. From there I took away the right of command and protected the town……certainly various things happened.<br/>
The matter like Luka’s circumstance, honestly I thought it would be better to not learn it.<br/>
Because the ancestors were resurrected as memories, the truth came to light like this.<br/>
「The Sixth’s story was really shocking.」<br/>
『Aa~, that. Lyle ended up cleaning up his mess, or rather atoning for his mistake. Even so, I wonder which house was giving that aid. Was it a vassal doing the tactful thing?』<br/>
In the end we couldn’t learn who it was but, it was certainly a curious story.<br/>
「Come to think of it, what was the reason for me accepting the request this time?」<br/>
『What do you think? Well, you must understand it already.』<br/>
Considering what the ancestors were saying, were they meaning to make me aware that I was being surrounded by capable talent like Novem and the others?<br/>
「It’s to learn just how capable the people around me are, is it?」<br/>
『It’s not wrong but that’s not really it. Simply speaking, it’s because Lyle and also the girls around you are all capable. We wanted you to know that there are people trying to rise up and also various other kinds of people. In fact, there were also a lot of thing that shocked you right?』<br/>
Well, I learned that there were various kinds of people.<br/>
Starting from Lionel, there was also Norma-san. They surprised me. I wondered, did she want to be promoted to that degree, and so on. Her feeling of wanting to profit in an easy way was too strong……yep, it was horrible.<br/>
『Lyle is fundamentally capable after all. Because of that you don’t understand the feelings of normal people, and the girls around you are also a bit, you know……』<br/>
He spoke as though there was also problems with Novem and the others.<br/>
『It’s not like we’re telling you to understand other people’s feelings. But, you should be aware that there are various kinds of people.』<br/>
「……Yes.」<br/>
And then, the Thirds said with a wary voice.<br/>
『Also about Lionel-kun, he might be slightly dangerous.』<br/>
「Lionel?」<br/>
『The case this time is too strong of a stimulation for him it seems. It might be better for you to be on your guard against him.』<br/>
I nodded at the Third’s advice.<br/>
Certainly, Lionel’s condition wasn’t really good.<br/>
I asked the last thing.<br/>
「Third.」<br/>
『Hm?』<br/>
「The reason why the Third chose a sword instead of a bow──」<br/>
『……There isn’t any deep meaning to it. Just like what I told the Second, it’s not respectable for a noble to keep using a bow. A sword or a spear are the true weapons of a noble! It was an era where a lot more people than now were thinking like that, so I chose to use a sword.』<br/>
「I, is that so.」<br/>
『When I grew up, I went around defeating one-horned rabbits. Us three, grandfather, father, and son were really eager to hunt them to extinction. ……It was impossible though.』<br/>
I didn’t know what kind of face to make hearing the past of the three one-horned rabbit haters.<br/>
『……Dewy-niisan died in front of my eyes. I wanted to become so strong so I could save him. In the end, I too was dragging Nii-san with me all this time.』<br/>
The Third stared at the silver bow floating in the room of the round table while expressing his mind.<br/>
.<br/>
──Sophia was sitting while hugging her knees.<br/>
Inside the vehicle Aria and Miranda were lying down with a blanket wrapping their body.<br/>
She buried her face on her knees and recalled her self yesterday.<br/>
「……I’m so ashamed I can’t look at Lyle-dono’s face.」<br/>
She moved around with only a piece of robe and nothing else underneath, in addition she was eating a lot for the whole day so her body was heavy.<br/>
Shannon was making an exasperated face.<br/>
「Didn’t you loiter around in just your underwear when you were in my house? What’s the reason for you feeling ashamed now?」<br/>
Sophia lifted her face.<br/>
「That’s different from getting seen naked!」<br/>
「It’s not that different isn’t it?」<br/>
When the two were arguing, Miranda slowly rose up.<br/>
Her complexion was bad like yesterday, but there was no light in her pupils even though her eyes were glassy.<br/>
Honestly speaking it was scary.<br/>
「……Water.」<br/>
「Ye, yes, Onee-sama!」<br/>
Shannon who was holding a flask reacted to Miranda’s words and presented the water.<br/>
Miranda took the flask from Shannon and drank the water, then she glared at Sophia with a gloomy atmosphere.<br/>
「……I’m in pain so be quiet.」<br/>
Sophia nodded several times.<br/>
「Ye, yes!」<br/>
While Miranda was being languid, Lyle came down from the ceiling’s hatch.<br/>
「As expected there is no need for three people to be on the roof.」<br/>
Clara and Monica were at the driver seat.<br/>
Novem and Eva were acting as lookout on the roof.<br/>
Then, Miranda’s attitude changed drastically. She was still in a bad shape, but light returned to her eyes. She was giving off a slightly pained atmosphere.<br/>
「Lyle, welcome back.」<br/>
「Miranda-san, you have to sleep. You’re still looking sick.」<br/>
「I’m fine. I’m resting after all. But, this time it’s really severe.」<br/>
Sophia watched Lyle sitting beside Miranda while thinking.<br/>
(Even though she should be sick because of the pre-Growth, Miranda-san is able to be considerate to Lyle-san like this. It’s amazing. ……It’s a bit scary though.)<br/>
Sophia was honestly impressed at the figure of Miranda enduring her sickness with spirit to talk to Lyle.<br/>
When she looked at Shannon, she was relieved because Miranda’s atmosphere had changed.<br/>
She accepted the flask and hung it on her neck again.<br/>
Lyle was thinking of how to deal with the sick looking Miranda.<br/>
「E, err, is there anything I can do?」<br/>
「You don’t need to mind me. But, let’s see……perhaps you can give me lap pillow for a bit?」<br/>
「If you’re fine with that」<br/>
Miranda boldly asked Lyle for a lap pillow. Sophia was surprised.<br/>
(A, asking such a bold thing! Wait, Lyle-dono also accepted it so easily!)<br/>
Lyle was giving a lap pillow. Although his face looked a bit embarrassed, he placed his hand on Miranda’s shoulder.<br/>
Sophia was staring at that while feeling jealous, but she suddenly noticed that Porter’s speed was decreasing.<br/>
「Is it break time?」<br/>
Shannon shook her head.<br/>
「That’s not it. Because, we’ve only taken a break just now.」<br/>
Sophia stood up thinking if there was some kind of problem. Eva noticed the abnormality and showed her face from the hatch.<br/>
「Hey, why are we stopping?」<br/>
Porter had stopped completely.<br/>
「I also don’t know. What about the situation outside?」<br/>
「I’m asking because there is nothing happening. In that case, is there a problem with Porter itself?」<br/>
When Sophia thought to head to the driver seat, Monica came with Clara on her back.<br/>
「Clara-san!?」<br/>
Sophia was worried. In response Monica was,<br/>
「It’s fine. Her health suddenly turned worse. I judged that it’s the sign of Growth just like everyone. She can’t drive like this so I’m thinking if it’ll be better to let her rest.」<br/>
And then Monica looked at Lyle. She saw Miranda and made a slightly not amused face, but her face immediately smiled.<br/>
「Chicken dickwad, this is the situation so please take care of the driving.」<br/>
「Yeah, got it. Miranda-san, sorry but I’ve to go.」<br/>
「Ye, yes, that’s alright. If Clara cannot move then it can’t be helped.」<br/>
Sophia didn’t overlook how Miranda glared at Monica just for a moment. Monica herself turned a triumphant smile towards such Miranda and invited Lyle to the driver seat.<br/>
「Chicken dickwad, let’s flirt with the two of us alone there.」<br/>
「No, I’m not going to do that.」<br/>
After seeing off the two vanishing into the driver seat, Miranda’s atmosphere worsened again. Sophia immediately sought help from Shannon. But, Shannon pushed the flask on Sophia.<br/>
「I, I’ll go to the driver seat too!」<br/>
Eva too said 「There’s no problem then」 and closed the hatch. Sophia ended up being left alone in the place where three people were lying down.<br/>
(Wait, someone please save meeeee!)<br/>
No one saved such Sophia and she passed an awkward time until the next break time──<br/>
.<br/>
The driver seat.<br/>
I who took over Porter’s driving listened to Monica and Shannon playing beside me while my hand was holding the Jewel.<br/>
「Wait, you untied it too quickly!」<br/>
「Fuh, looks like cat’s cradle is too advanced of a game for you little girl. Well, this Monica won’t go easy even at game. I’ll allow myself to lose only against chicken dickwad.」<br/>
「Isn’t that unfair? Go easy on me too. Come on, one more time.」<br/>
「I’ll accept your challenges no matter how many times. Now, come at me.」<br/>
The two of them were playing with string that was created from tied knitting wool.<br/>
Around Porter that was slowly moving, there were the subjugation force that was traveling by foot.<br/>
I matched the moving speed with them while grasping the Jewel.<br/>
One day, would the day come that everyone vanished from inside the Jewel?<br/>
Would I be able to have a farewell that I could accept with the five of them?<br/>
When I thought that the time of parting would someday come──my heart tightened.<br/>
