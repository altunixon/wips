I know she hadn’t spoken those words out of malice but… it really stung.<br/>
Putting the fact that I’d told them that in the first place aside, it hurt me when my secret was leaked out by my childhood friend to other people.<br/>
「Then, I just need to train more to get better!! Kaya, prepare more targets for me!!」<br/>
「Right away, Milady.」<br/>
Kyouka released my hands before turning around to face the newly prepared target.<br/>
Well, though some of her actions didn’t make any sense to me, I was glad that she was really motivated right now. At least, she wouldn’t force herself like before.<br/>
Though it was just little by little, Kyouka’s control over her magic had already improved. I guess it won’t take her too long before she masters her own style.<br/>
At that moment, a sudden realization dawned on me regarding an extremely important matter. Had I just created another dangerous opponent for my enemy’s side? Though I’d initially just been caught up by her simple wish, I’d forgotten the fact that she was on my enemy’s side.<br/>
Basically, I would have to fight her along with the other women if Reiji ever came to invade Nargol. And at that time, the target of her magic might be me.<br/>
I couldn’t help but think… had I just dug my own grave?<br/>
「What’s the matter, Kuroki? You look like an idiot right now.」<br/>
Shirone called out to me with her voice carefree as ever.<br/>
「No, it’s nothing….」<br/>
I replied to her, pulling myself out of my thoughts. Kyouka might be able to solve her own problems by herself even without my advice. I guess I shouldn’t worry too much about this matter since I was just accelerating that progress.<br/>
It would be fine as long as I got stronger than I was currently.<br/>
I mean, Kyouka was smiling happily right now after she’d realized the trick to using magic. That’s why I’m happy for her too, even if that progress meant that my life was shortened.<br/>
I decided to be positive.<br/>
◆Goddess of Wisdom and Victory; Rena<br/>
I’d come back to my house in Elio since my valkyries would ramble non-stop if I hadn’t come back soon.<br/>
My residence in Elios was located on top of a floating island anchored to the peak of the Elios mountain and connected to the main island via a rainbow bridge. There was a lake on my island with a garden at the center of it. This was the usual scenery of my home.<br/>
「Welcome back, Rena-sama.」<br/>
Upon seeing me coming back, my valkyries, led by Nier, came to greet me.<br/>
「Yes, thank you for your efforts in keeping my home safe during my absence.」<br/>
I took off my hood and gave it to one of the angel’s[valkyrie type].<br/>
「Have you taken care all of your business in the mortal realm?」<br/>
Nier asked me.<br/>
「Yeah, I’ve had enough of it.」<br/>
I’d replenished my ‘Kuroki vitamin’ more than enough. I wonder how long it will be till I can see him again.<br/>
「Enough? But… Reiji doesn’t seem have to been saved yet?」<br/>
Nier who followed me from behind asked with a worried voice.<br/>
Why did she suddenly mention Reiji’s name here? It’s unpleasant.<br/>
「I’ve no idea what you are worrying about, Nier. It’ll be fine, he’s Reiji after all.」<br/>
Nier seemed to be puzzled when I turned around and told her so.<br/>
「Is that so?」<br/>
「Yes, it is exactly as I say.」<br/>
I replied to her, filled with conviction.<br/>
Kuroki went into Labrys labyrinth too afterall. As if that Labrys could beat my Kuroki. Him saving Reiji is just a bonus, there’s nothing to worry about when my man made his move.<br/>
That’s why I could say this to Nier with a confident voice.<br/>
「I mean, my knight is the strongest.」<br/>
===<br/>
◆Sword’s Maiden Shirone<br/>
Both Kuroki and I dove into the Quice river in the afternoon. Naturally, our goal was to save Reiji and co.<br/>
As for the reason we’d departed during the afternoon, it was because Kyouka-san had booked Kuroki to train her this morning. Since Kuroki might be back right after we saved Reiji and co from the labyrinth, it was why Kyouka-san had asked Kuroki to teach her before we departed to save them.<br/>
Both Kyouka-san and Kaya-san were still training right now. It seemed that Kuroki felt that he no longer needed to give any advice to Kyouka-san.<br/>
According to Kuroki, Kyouka-san was already extremely talented from the very beginning, all she needed was a trigger to awaken her talent and she would naturally understand what she needed to do after that.<br/>
I looked at Kuroki by my side.<br/>
He was currently clad in that hateful Dark Knight’s armor.<br/>
Even though it would be fine even if he kept staying with us without returning to Nargol. But, in this matter alone, Kuroki stood firm in his decision to go back to Nargol. Even though it’ll be fine even if he kept staying with us without going back to Nargol.<br/>
He’d basically ignored any kind of persuasion, even when that persuasion came from me. Could it be that his current condition was also due to that woman?<br/>
Yeah, it was definitely due to that woman. Wait for me, Kuroki, I’ll definitely get you back.<br/>
But it has to wait till we’ve saved Reiji and co.<br/>
Kuroki and I kept diving deeper and deeper into the river. I could breath in the water thanks to the assistance of the water spirit. As for Kuroki, it seems he used the power of the water dragon in his body.<br/>
The one who led us were the Lizardmen.<br/>
After investigating the blueprints of the labyrinth, which for some reason had ended up in Kuroki’s hands, the Lizardmen had found a canal that would lead us towards the labyrinth. According to the labyrinth’s blueprint, this canal was connected to the 5th floor, the place where Reiji and co currently trapped in.<br/>
Naturally, the canal was too small a human to go through it. We might be able to enter if we could turn our body into smaller size but, I can’t use such magic.<br/>
In addition to that, there’s something like a membrane of light which acts like some sort of barrier around the labyrinth. But, that barrier wasn’t flawless. We should be able to pass the barrier as long as we entered via its gap. The most difficult part of this was looking for the gap in the barrier.<br/>
I alone might not be able to find that gap without Kuroki and the Lizardmen’s help.<br/>
We could go to save everyone as soon as we bypassed this barrier.<br/>
I drew my sword, readying myself for battle.<br/>
「Wait for me, everyone, I’m gonna save you soon.」<br/>
I raised my sword, and swung it down.<br/>
◆Black Haired Sage; Chiyuki<br/>
「What…. happened just now….」<br/>
I unintentionally muttered out loud.<br/>
A moment ago, I’d felt a wave of magical power. It seems that Rino and Nao, who were currently enjoying tea with me, had also felt something.<br/>
「Chiyuki-san…. It seems the barrier has vanished.」<br/>
「I can hear spirit-san’s voice again too, Chiyuki-san.」<br/>
We nodded as soon as we exchanged glances.<br/>
It seems that Shirone and co have come to save us.<br/>
「Is something the matter, everyone?」<br/>
Reiji-kun entered the dining room with Sahoko and Euria.<br/>
「Fufufu, the barrier has vanished, Reiji-kun. It seems Shirone and co have come to save us.」<br/>
The three of them were really surprised when I told them the news.<br/>
「As expected of Shirone. It seems my prediction is spot on again.」<br/>
「Fufufufu. yes Rei-kun, I’m glad that we chose to wait for them on this floor.」<br/>
Both Reiji and Sahoko were smiling happily.<br/>
「Such a thing… the barrier is…. Atla-… doing…?」<br/>
Yet for some reason, Euria was muttering something with a low voice.<br/>
「Is something the matter, Princess Euria?」<br/>
She looked flustered when I asked her.<br/>
「I-It’s nothing! I’ll go to inform everyone of this news at once!!!」<br/>
Euria left the dining room in a hurry.<br/>
Just what in the world was her reaction just now?<br/>
「Since the barrier has vanished, it means that we can finally leave this place.」<br/>
「Come to think of it, Reiji-kun, we might be able to use transfer magic and bring everyone to escape from this place right now!!」<br/>
◆Evil God; Labrys<br/>
「WHAT DO YOU MEAN BY THE BARRIER HAS VANISHED!!!!?」<br/>
I yelled back at the minotaur who came to report about the vanished barrier. Hearing that, the human females in this throne room were trembling non-stop.<br/>
Those females were really irritating.<br/>
They were the females that were kidnapped from their home outside of this labyrinth. They’re my favorite being kept on the 13th floor.<br/>
Though the human females looked much better than other races, they were far too fragile and died from just my caress. The ones who’d managed to survive so far didn’t reach even ten percent of their original number from when they’d first been brought here.<br/>
This was far from enough to appease my raging lust.<br/>
That’s why I’m looking for a tough female. Naturally, toughness alone isn’t enough, they’ve got to be beautiful too.<br/>
I still remember the shock when I first saw Rena’s beauty many years ago. That time I decided to make that beautiful goddess into my wife.<br/>
That’s why I definitely can’t allow that wretched existence called Hero of Light who was rumored to be Rena’s lover.<br/>
Just what in the world is Atlankua doing right now?<br/>
Something must have happened outside since the barrier suddenly was torn to shreds, and yet, there’s no reports coming from her.<br/>
That ugly spider is really useless after all.<br/>
At this rate, it’s only a matter of time before that hero escapes from this place.<br/>
I couldn’t help but grit my teeth in frustration.<br/>
And the one who could erect the barrier again, Zarxis, isn’t in this place right now. I can’t erect a powerful barrier without that guy.<br/>
But, I can’t just let them escape regardless.<br/>
「Tell everyone to not let the hero escape from this place!!」<br/>
◆Black Haired Sage; Chiyuki<br/>
「What!!? Zuun kidnapped Princes Euria!!!」<br/>
I was currently interrogating Euria’s attendant in Uz’s center plaza.<br/>
The other people had already been sent back outside of the labyrinth with transfer magic. We only know later that Zuun, the minotaur, had kidnapped Princess Euria.<br/>
「Yes, Chiyuki-sama. It happened so fast and by the time I realized, the minotaur called Zuun had kidnapped my princess. Oh, and he left a message for you guys too. Here is his message: “Don’t you dare to leave the labyrinth, otherwise, I don’t know what will happen to her”.」<br/>
Her attendant bowed to me. Even though I can’t see her expression, she looked as if nothing had happened even though she was reporting the matter of her master being kidnapped. Shouldn’t she be worrying more about her master at this point?<br/>
But since she could report this news calmly without being agitated, even after seeing the event herself, I guess she was originally a girl who couldn’t express herself.<br/>
「No, we’ve to save her quickly!!!」<br/>
