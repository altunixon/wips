<br/>
Intermission: Arisa's Master<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Are you stupid?<br/>
Hey, let me say it once more. Are you stupid?<br/>
<br/>
Reading the atmosphere, I stop those abusive words in my chest.<br/>
The object of those words is my [Master]. That powerful enemy is acting presumptuous because he's got that much monstrous power and now, he's challenging that.<br/>
<br/>
You will absolutely lose I said, I know that you have secret unique skills, but your level is only 10, you know?<br/>
No matter how great your skills are, there's no way it could overcome 4 times level difference!<br/>
<br/>
Moreover, he's hiding his skills even though his level is so low. I wouldn't know what kind of secret technique you've prepared!<br/>
<br/>
"I won't hesitate to turn this into a bloodbath you know?"<br/>
<br/>
The monster says so while pointing his cane to my master.<br/>
<br/>
"It's no good! Master, this guy is too strong."<br/>
"Trashes don't have any place to call me 'this guy'."<br/>
<br/>
Yes, I'm doing my best to call for [master's] attention, but the attack is coming here. Ah, this life is going to be over here huh. I want to flirt before I die~.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
◇<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
I still remember the day I meet him.<br/>
I was in the shaking slave carriage that had just arrived in Seryuu city. It was depressing only looking at the gloomy slaves in the carriage.<br/>
At that time, I felt a gaze from somewhere, and he was there.<br/>
<br/>
Black hair.<br/>
<br/>
Black pupils.<br/>
<br/>
Delicate build.<br/>
<br/>
And, Japanese face.<br/>
<br/>
Yes, [Love], it had been a long time since I saw my right-in-the-center type after seeing only macho in this world.<br/>
Particularly, the slightly unreliable easy-to-push-round look is nice. My creative impulse is welling up. My delusional power cannot be stopped, like that.<br/>
You seem to be wearing good clothes, why don't you buy me and Lulu.<br/>
<br/>
I deliberately attempted to use chantless charm magic, but the carriage went to the road's corner.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
◇<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
To protect me, [Master] charges toward the monster.<br/>
<br/>
What, what's with that speed!<br/>
I thought he had just started to step forward, but he had already slipped into the monster's bosom, driving a blow.<br/>
I've seen my country's knight leader and hero having a bout before, he's faster than the hero's rush at that time. Yup, too fast.<br/>
<br/>
But, the monster shrugs off that attack like it's a breeze. The monster completes its chant just like that, and flings the appearing shadow whips towards me.<br/>
<br/>
I hope it's not instant death.<br/>
<br/>
While thinking that, as my last resistance, I chantlessly fire Psycho Bullet toward the shadow whip, but it doesn't work well.<br/>
I wonder why did I read the book about mind magic when I was in the castle. If it was light or fire magic, I could retaliate this monster.<br/>
<br/>
However, the shadow whip doesn't reach me. My [master] moves as if he's teleporting and receives the attack with his body.<br/>
Even though he's delicate, his back looks slightly wide, and relief surfaces along with anger in me.<br/>
<br/>
Why are you acting so rash!<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
◇<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
The next time I met him was several days after. I remember the surrounding was noisy because the missing slave trader had came back.<br/>
<br/>
Since a good customer is here, the expensive girls that would likely sells were to be shown in turns. Apparently the opponent was quite formidable, 10 girls had dejectedly returned.<br/>
And then, it's our turn, the six unpopular ones. If the girls before weren't selling, there's no way we would, curse.<br/>
<br/>
And the one who's sitting in the sofa inside the tent is him. He's with three beast kin girls behind. Alright, I'll get his favor!<br/>
<br/>
Nidoren, the slave trader, is saying something, but right now I'm putting power to my eyes!<br/>
<br/>
But, the appeal from this beauty doesn't reach him, he almost leaves from the place. I become panicked and try to appeal with words. Fufufu, receive this appeal attack from me who's accustomed with job-hunting!<br/>
<br/>
However, he's tough.<br/>
Even after I explain the merit and convey my feeling, he's completely unwavering.<br/>
Can't be helped, I'll use my last resort. I won't let this chance pass, even if it means I have to use heartless means!<br/>
<br/>
Get shaken with chantless, [Charm Person], and [Fret].<br/>
<br/>
Huh~?　It's not working.<br/>
<br/>
The magic finally works after I use my trump card, Never Give up.<br/>
Who is this person?<br/>
His name is Satou, and his face looks Japanese, he must be a transported person right?<br/>
<br/>
Well, let's be happy with this for now.<br/>
Fuffuffu, I won't let you sleep tonight.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
◇<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Something that looks like a joke is happening in front of my eyes.<br/>
Is he really a human? He grasp the supposedly untouchable magic restraints with his hands and tries to do something about it.<br/>
<br/>
"It's hard to grasp even though it doesn't have reaction, this stupid <<fantasy>> things."<br/>
<br/>
He really get away from the restraint even while complaining.<br/>
No no, you can't normally do that.<br/>
<br/>
"What is your purpose?"<br/>
<br/>
Mou, forget about purpose.<br/>
First of all, we should get away from here in order to live.<br/>
<br/>
It's too bad, but let's give up on Mia.<br/>
Mia, I'm sorry. You can resent me however much. I'm helpless with my power.<br/>
<br/>
"Do you have grudges with heroes?"<br/>
"Way off the mark."<br/>
<br/>
The discussion breaks off, a lot of shadow whips are coming from under the monster's feet and go towards Mia.<br/>
He takes out two handguns from his pocket and shoots down the shadow whips.<br/>
<br/>
Oh!　Cool~<br/>
Why doesn't this world have digital camera!<br/>
<br/>
I'm having an out-of-place thought to escape from the stress from this hopeless situation.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
◇<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
I've played a petty trick during our contract ceremony. I've mixed, [You can approach me day and night.] With this, as long as master doesn't seriously order against it, it won't be considered a violation of contract.<br/>
<br/>
I'm clever~♪　Arisa-chan great victory.<br/>
<br/>
On the way back to the inn, interesting things keep piling up.<br/>
<br/>
Itadakimasu?<br/>
<br/>
Protein?<br/>
<br/>
This person really is Satou-san huh?<br/>
<br/>
Let's put aside such trivial things.<br/>
<br/>
No matter what happen, tonight is my first night!<br/>
I haven't had first night in my previous life!<br/>
I'll fully demonstrate you my net knowledge, boy!<br/>
<br/>
I enter the inn room while feeling excited.<br/>
<br/>
We're in the same room.<br/>
I understand, boy. A 15 years old is at his peak of wanting it!<br/>
<br/>
"Arisa and Lulu, you two can use that bed."<br/>
<br/>
Does he want to attack us as set?<br/>
Lulu is pure, if possible, I want her to have normal loving one.<br/>
<br/>
I was waiting for his attack, 'is it now', 'or now', but he was sleeping on the next bed.<br/>
<br/>
IM-POS-SI-BLE!<br/>
<br/>
I put Lulu to sleep with mind magic and crawl into master's bed.<br/>
I feel sorry, but I don't have any regret.<br/>
<br/>
The result was utter failure, but turned out he really is a Japanese. <br/>
I don't know if he's a reincarnated or transported, but with that Japanese face, he's probably a transported one. Can't be sure with Lulu here though.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
◇<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
"Arisa! When morning comes, go ask for assistance at the worker's guild manager."<br/>
<br/>
Uwaah~, stupid stupid stupid.<br/>
I frantically jump to him who is sinking together with Mia into shadow portal.<br/>
<br/>
But, I didn't reach him.<br/>
The shadows that come out slip and graze me.<br/>
<br/>
"Arisa, let's take care of those for now."<br/>
<br/>
Liza plunges toward three shadow stalkers alone.<br/>
Doing such reckless attack, even the usually calm Liza is greatly shaken.<br/>
<br/>
While I fight the shadow stalkers with chantless shock wave, Pochi, Tama and Liza are supporting me.<br/>
<br/>
Liza got hurt, but we somehow won.<br/>
I give Liza first-aid with the help of my previous life's memory, while Pochi and Tama are preparing the wagon.<br/>
<br/>
I wanted to have Lulu to drive the wagon, but since she can't see well in the darkness, it'd be dangerous so I leave it to Liza and Tama.<br/>
<br/>
"Master is alright nanodesu?"<br/>
"Come back~?"<br/>
<br/>
I want to know that too!<br/>
But, as an adult woman I can't possibly slap nervous little girls.<br/>
<br/>
"Of course, he' s alright. He's our master remember. Of course he's coming back!"<br/>
<br/>
I declare so while convincing myself midway.<br/>
I won't ask him to be in one piece, but at least please come back alive!<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
◇<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
When we're waiting for the gate of Seryuu city to open, Tama begins making noise.<br/>
<br/>
"Re~?"<br/>
"What's wrong nodesu."<br/>
"Master, there~!"<br/>
<br/>
What did you say!<br/>
<br/>
"Is that true, Tama!"<br/>
<br/>
I press toward Tama.<br/>
Whoops, the wagon suddenly moves and I fall down.<br/>
Although she wasn't complaining before, Liza's eyes are looking very desperate.<br/>
This girl might be unexpectedly the most worried.<br/>
<br/>
"He's there desu!"<br/>
"Sama~."<br/>
"Yeah, master. ...He's safe.<br/>
<br/>
Pochi, and Tama, then Liza who has became emotional is choking her words.<br/>
Hey wait, where is he?<br/>
<br/>
"Arisa, there. At hill on the road ahead, in white clothes."<br/>
<br/>
He's there!<br/>
What are you doing so nonchalantly waving here.<br/>
<br/>
"...I, I was worried! Mou, promise me to never do something that absurd ever again!!"<br/>
<br/>
I shout and cry on his chest.<br/>
He's apologizing so many, many times, but he absolutely doesn't understand.<br/>
<br/>
I will become strong.<br/>
To protect this stupid and reckless [Master] from jumping into dangerous situation!<br/>
<br/>
I am Arisa.<br/>
Former Japanese, Tachibana Arisha<br/>
My love story won't lose to this absurd parallel world (fantasy)!<br/>
