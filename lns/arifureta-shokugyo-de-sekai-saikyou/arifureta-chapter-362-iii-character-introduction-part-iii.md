That person.<br/>
Nemesia<br/>
Rank number 2 of super maid group "Fleur Knights" that was formed for the sake (lol) of Liliana. Neashutatrum of the External Murder. Her other name was Nea-chan of Hauria Clan.

Liliana-san couldn’t wrap her head around it.<br/>
Veronica<br/>
Fleur Knights rank four. Real name, Kuzeri Rail. The knight commander of Heiligh Kingdom……or that should be the case but, unnoticed she had become a maid. Liliana-san had somehow guessed it. She also thought, work environment is really important isn’t it.<br/>
Freesia<br/>

She was in the age where she got a bit excited seeing the scene of a certain kouhai-chan got toyed by the demon king-senpai.

Claudia Barenberg<br/>
The strongest exorcist and the saint of Vatican’s anti demon organization "Omnibus". However she was a self-destructing type saint who was normally a severely clumsy girl. She often fell off from car that was running. Once she also fell from a chartered plane that was in the middle of flight. However for some reason she would get out of such accident unscathed, in a sense she was a miraculous existence that was worthy of the title "saint". She was saved by the abyss lord and managed to accomplish her lifelong desire of taking revenge for her parents. As the result she became abyss lord’s fourth wife, perhaps. PS: Her figure rivaled Tio, her butt was especially big.<br/>
Aziz Stein<br/>
Omnibus’s exorcist. Claudia’s stepbrother. Although not at the level of Claudia, he was an owner of good instinct that would notice Kousuke. His adoration toward Kousuke wasn’t half baked which was used as prey for the delusion of a portion of rotten people who witnessed it.<br/>
Wynn Keyman<br/>
Omnibus’s exorcist. 28 year old man with swept back blonde hair. He had serious personality and treasured Claudia greatly. But, even if she bungled up he would pretend to not see around 80% of it. There was limit in everything.<br/>
Anna Folk<br/>

The nicknames he obtained were "Beating Priest", "Desecrator of Book", "That guy, he actually got no faith at all ain’t he?", "Absolute Demon Killerman", "Physical Miracle User", "The Man Who Often Launched Airdrop Assault at Abyss Lord", etc. Sometimes his ally would mistook him as demon.<br/>
Maya Coloca<br/>
A former exorcist of Omnibus and currently the manager of a secret passage. She killed demon physically. Attempted to kill Kousuke with her eye glint. She didn’t shot her sacred vessel that had the form of bow and arrow. She used it as blunt weapon or stabbing weapon. The nicknames she obtained were "Absolute Demon Killerwoman", "Desecrator of Bow", "Rather, it should be better if she used sword or blunt weapon normally ain’t it?", "Anti-Beating Priest Ultimate Weapon", "The Scariest Holy Mother", "The Woman Whose Eyes Never Smiled When Looking at Abyss Lord", etc. Sometimes her ally would mistake her as demon.<br/>

Until just a little while ago he was an unmanageable person with strong of sense of justice who tended to run wild because of it, even then he was a normal male but……it seemed something happened at Japan and he was awakened.<br/>
Pope<br/>
Actually had a hidden side as the supreme commander of Omnibus. He was friend with Director Dime since a long time ago, but his stomachache’s cause was the director in general. Recently there was also the negotiation with demon king party with the abyss lord as the contact person and the amount of his stomachache was increasing in an accelerated rate. Even though he was the person at the top, he was also the hardest worker. Also, the nicknames of the director and Maya mostly came from this person.<br/>

Omnibus’s former exorcist. His heart broke from a battle without salvation and he sold his soul to demon.<br/>
