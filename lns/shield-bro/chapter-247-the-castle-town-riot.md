Chapter 247: The Castle Town Riot<br/>
On our way to the top of the castle, we meet multiple brainwashed parties, but each time, Rishia throws her weapon and nullifies the brainwashing.<br/>
The higher we climb, the more we encounter, and the more our forces increase through our dispelling of the brainwashing.<br/>
While we climb, I am able to look out of the windows at the situation below.<br/>
Many fires have broken out, and smoke is rising from parts of the city.<br/>
Hmm?<br/>
Is it my imagination? I see dust clouds racing across the scenery.<br/>
That… It’s best not to think about it.<br/>
I give up on the outside and begin searching the castle itself.<br/>
Eventually, I run into a wall made out of a thick layer of ice.<br/>
It’s most likely a barricade the Queen and her magicians made.<br/>
She did say her specialty was ice.<br/>
The brainwashed people are slamming their weapons into and casting magic on the wall in an attempt to break it.<br/>
We easily bring them to our side, so there’s no problem.<br/>
"What should we do? Should we break through here?" (Naofumi)<br/>
"You’re smashing it?" (Firo)<br/>
"There doesn’t seem to be another path…" (Naofumi)<br/>
We could scale the walls outside, but they probably have defences set up there.<br/>
"Firo will try." (Firo)<br/>
"Okay." (Rishia)<br/>
"I’ll also help." (Atlas)<br/>
Firo and Atlas begin running towards the ice.<br/>
"Ah, oy!" (Naofumi)<br/>
If I just leave it to Rishia, we may be able to break it from afar.<br/>
"Deryaaaaaah!" (Firo)<br/>
"Tei!" (Atlas)<br/>
Firo and the Filo Rials’ kicks, on top of Atlas’s… vital thrust… easily cause the wall to crumble.<br/>
"It was quite hard. Was that because of the magic?" (Firo)<br/>
"Probably." (Atlas)<br/>
In the end, they’re all muscle-heads.<br/>
The guards we saved seem to be surprised.<br/>
Now that I think about it, I haven’t encountered anyone from my village here yet.<br/>
We proceed and run into a door sealed with ice.<br/>
I put my ear to it and hear a familiar voice.<br/>
It’s probably one of my slaves.<br/>
I see. So they’ve pushed the Queen back all the way here.<br/>
I’ll be able to increase my fighting force.<br/>
"Firo, Atlas!" (Naofumi)<br/>
"Yes~." (Firo)<br/>
"As you command!" (Atlas)<br/>
We break down the door and peer inside.<br/>
And for some reason, we find the slaves tied up lying on the floor.<br/>
I ask Rishia to dispel their brainwashing.<br/>
It’s always nice to increase ally count.<br/>
But why are these slaves here? They don’t seem to know either.<br/>
Were they defeated? Were they taken as prisoners of war?<br/>
The inside of the castle is locked down.<br/>
So how did Witch slip them in this far?<br/>
"Oy, what did Witch declare, anyways?" (Naofumi)<br/>
I direct the question to the soldiers.<br/>
"Yes, she said that by giving preferential treatment to Demi-Humans, the Queen was trampling on the traditions the proud country of Melromark had carried out for generations, and that’s why their position was the logical one." (Soldier)<br/>
That means that using Demi-Human slaves to defeat the Queen…<br/>
Wouldn’t be a possible modus operandi.<br/>
They need to have the Queen captured by Human hands…<br/>
But, they could just order my slaves to kill the Queen and then declare that they would never forgive the Demi-Humans who would cause such unrest.<br/>
Or, that she would never forgive the Demi-Humans who killed her mother. She could cause the public to harbor even greater resentment against them.<br/>
That’s possible.<br/>
In the end, that means that they would turn their forces against me and once again wage war with Silt Welt.<br/>
And like that, Witch, the Three Hero Church, and the Revolutionary Faction would all gain power.<br/>
That seems like a possible plan for that Bitch.<br/>
"Anyways, we have to march forwards." (Naofumi)<br/>
Taking the slaves with us, we proceed forward by destroying more walls of ice.<br/>
We finally reach the top.<br/>
"… There’s no one here." (Naofumi)<br/>
The room the Queen had apparently barricaded herself in was empty.<br/>
"What happened?" (Naofumi)<br/>
I search the rest of the castle, but there’s nothing.<br/>
But, some of the brainwashed soldiers we find later claim that they were helping the Queen before they were attacked.<br/>
It seems that these soldiers lured the enemy out and sealed them behind walls of ice. Everyone was getting desperate.<br/>
"Is there some sort of emergency exit or something?" (Naofumi)<br/>
Though such an exit holds no meaning if one’s own forces are brainwashed.<br/>
For even Witch not to know is beyond wishful thinking.<br/>
I should have brought Melty along.<br/>
She would probably be knowledgeable.<br/>
"So the only thing we can do is to check the outside." (Naofumi)<br/>
"Yes." (Atlas)<br/>
"Fue… Where’s the Queen?" (Rishia)<br/>
The most important person here lets out a pitiful voice.<br/>
She looks really unreliable.<br/>
No one would believe that she shouted such powerful words at Itsuki and defeated a Hero devoured by multiple curses.<br/>
"Ah, right Rishia. So in the end, is your weapon a Hero’s weapon or not?" (Naofumi)<br/>
"Well… I have no idea." (Rishia)<br/>
"Then why can it change form?" (Naofumi)<br/>
"A large selection of weapon options appeared in my field of vision, so I picked some." (Rishia)<br/>
Is it different from my Shield?<br/>
I still don’t know if it’s a Seven Star Weapon or not.<br/>
"Can you see reinforcement menus or help screens?" (Naofumi)<br/>
"Reinforcement? Help? I don’t see anything like that…" (Rishia)<br/>
None?<br/>
Just what could it be, this transparent changing weapon?<br/>
It has quite a bit of power.<br/>
"But something called SP did appear on my status." (Rishia)<br/>
"Fumu." (Naofumi)<br/>
Let’s just say she’s a Hero for now. I can investigate it after this incident is resolved.<br/>
We talk as we go back down the path we came. We arrive at the Castle’s gates.<br/>
The gates are wide open.<br/>
We walk to the plaza.<br/>
And there is a painting of hell. Corpses are piled all around… or not.<br/>
"Uu… J-justice…"<br/>
"Our cause…"<br/>
Justice Zombies are tied up and lying all over the place.<br/>
They are either unconscious or immobile.<br/>
Even so, they continue to preach out their Justice.<br/>
I keep all of this to myself. I say nothing to Rishia.<br/>
These people who were forced to use justice to judge people ended up being judged.<br/>
"What the hell happened here?" (Naofumi)<br/>
At the same time the words escape my lips…<br/>
"Ha HA! Angels! Onward we march!" (Motoyasu)<br/>
""Yes!"" (Angel Army)<br/>
Standing on a cart pulled by many Filo Rials, Motoyasu kicks up a large cloud of dust as he passes me.<br/>
"…"<br/>
And they simply run over everyone that looks like a Justice Zombie in their path.<br/>
Humans are being thrown into the air like garbage. I may get traumatized from this.<br/>
So Motoyasu is behind this terrifying spectacle.<br/>
… What is he even trying to do?<br/>
"T-thank you."<br/>
"Don’t worry about it! My Father-in-Law, the Hero of the Shield asked me to protect this town!" (Motoyasu)<br/>
An Adventurer who had escaped brainwashing goes up to Motoyasu.<br/>
Um… Yeah. It seems that the Castle Town’s problems have all been solved through violence.<br/>
They sure are fast. Ah, right. I think Motoyasu’s Three have class-upped.<br/>
"Oy, Motoyasu!" (Naofumi)<br/>
"Ah!? Could the person there be Firo-tan and Father-in-Law!? As you asked, I have been working hard to quell the riot in the Castle Town!" (Motoyasu)<br/>
As I call out to him, he shows off his white teeth and approaches us at an amazing speed.<br/>
Now I really want to run away.<br/>
"Mu! Go away!" (Firo)<br/>
Ah, my hand instinctively went to my Shield.<br/>
I had almost unintentionally used my Portal Shield.<br/>
It’s a good thing it’s still on cooldown.<br/>
"Are you sure you haven’t become the cause of a disaster yet?" (Naofumi)<br/>
"What are you saying, Father-in-Law!? I’m working this hard for you. Won’t you offer some praise to the Angels?" (Motoyasu)<br/>
""KUE!"" (Angels)<br/>
"…" (Naofumi)<br/>
My head hurts.<br/>
It’s a pain, so I randomly pat a Filo Rial’s head.<br/>
"Where’s Witch? I think she was making a base somewhere around here." (Naofumi)<br/>
"Witch? Who is that?" (Motoyasu)<br/>
Is he denying her very existence?<br/>
In reality, he only sees Firo anyways.<br/>
And like this, he does listen to my orders. I won’t complain… though I want him to change how he calls me.<br/>
"It’s the name of the woman who threw you away." (Naofumi)<br/>
"Ah, now that I think about it, there was a pig like that. Though, she wasn’t here when I came." (Motoyasu)<br/>
"I see…" (Naofumi)<br/>
Which means there’s nothing but Justice Zombies in this town, and Motoyasu is offering relief to the survivors.<br/>
What’s happening?<br/>
"Master." (Firo)<br/>
"What’s up?" (Naofumi)<br/>
"Well, you see, I smell Raphtalia-Oneechan’s scent." (Firo)<br/>
"Raphtalia’s?" (Naofumi)<br/>
"Yeah. Over there." (Firo)<br/>
The direction she pointed was outside the city, towards Ryuut Village.<br/>
But, it’s finally come to tracking by scent… Her monster abilities come out here.<br/>
Or is that common sense for animals?<br/>
"For now, Rishia, you need to go around Castle Town and return the Zombies to their senses. We’ll look for the Queen, Witch, and apparently Raphtalia. Everyone else should help out with Rishia’s work." (Naofumi)<br/>
"Understood." (Rishia)<br/>
"Father-in-Law! What do you want me to do?" (Motoyasu)<br/>
"Continue taking down the Zombies and gather them in one place. Help anyone who hasn’t been brainwashed." (Naofumi)<br/>
"Understood, Father! Now, my Angels, onwards!" (Motoyasu)<br/>
"KUE!" (Filo Rials)<br/>
"Ya~y!" (Filo Rials)<br/>
Later, this incident came to be known as the Witch’s Rebellion… not. It actually came to be known as the Melromark Holy Bird Riot.<br/>
But, that doesn’t really matter to me.<br/>
I get on Firo, and she begins running.<br/>
"Ah, Naofumi-sama, don’t leave me behind!" (Atlas)<br/>
With Atlas.<br/>
"Alright, Firo. If Raphtalia is here, we should go find her." (Naofumi)<br/>
I shout out as we barrel down the main road.<br/>
The Weapon Shop enters my field of vision.<br/>
… Is the Old Man alright? I don’t want to find him as an enemy later.<br/>
I want to believe he’s okay. I’ll check quickly.<br/>
"Firo, stop by the Weapon shop." (Naofumi)<br/>
"Oka~y." (Firo)<br/>
I carefully scan the inside of the dark store.<br/>
The shelves… Have been cleared of all weapons.<br/>
"Old Man… Are you here?" (Naofumi)<br/>
…There’s no response.<br/>
I cautiously enter the store.<br/>
I put my hand on the handle to the only door inside of it and open it.<br/>
"You thief! For the sake of Justice, die!"<br/>
"Uwah!" (Naofumi)<br/>
The Old Man? No, it’s an adventurer I’ve never seen before.<br/>
Firo and Atlas make him faint immediately.<br/>
Who’s a thief? Isn’t that you?<br/>
"Ah, that surprised me." (Naofumi)<br/>
I thought it was the old man, and my heart skipped a beat.<br/>
"Naofumi-sama, it seems that besides this person, there is no one else in the building." (Atlas)<br/>
"Yeah, there’s no one." (Firo)<br/>
"I see." (Naofumi)<br/>
Atlas can see with Chi, so she can search the area to some extent.<br/>
And Firo has her feral instincts, so I guess there’s no doubt about it.<br/>
I hope that the Old Man was able to escape safely.<br/>
He may be loitering around somewhere.<br/>
Anyways, why is this adventurer here?<br/>
I’ll leave it as one of the mysteries of Zombies.<br/>
"Okay, we’re starting again." (Naofumi)<br/>
"Ye~s!" (Firo)<br/>
And so, we pass through the Castle Town gate that was supposed to be barred during the night. We run across the plains, barely illuminated by the rising sun.<br/>
