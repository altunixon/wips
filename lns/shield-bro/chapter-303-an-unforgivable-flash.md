Chapter 303: An Unforgivable Flash<br/>
As always, the problem is his absorption ability.<br/>
The Spirit Turtle Shell cannot stop the drain of MP.<br/>
The Barbarian Armor has Absorb Resist (Medium), so luckily, my magic didn’t fall to zero.<br/>
… I can’t deny the possibility that he can absorb SP as well.<br/>
I could change to the Soul Eater Shield with Drain Null, but then my defense would drop.<br/>
It’s not that I wouldn’t be able to manage, but I think my Spirit Turtle Shell was just barely able to take that last attack.<br/>
I don’t have to rely on Wrath yet… but I don’t know what option to choose.<br/>
Hmm?<br/>
The Lower Level Houou has regenerated itself. Its damage is gone.<br/>
Oy… could it be that whenever this attack is released, its recovery hastens?<br/>
I turn my eyes to the higher one.<br/>
That one seems that it’ll take a while longer before it fully recovers, but this is an annoying ability.<br/>
"Cut at it before it can heal itself!"<br/>
"Yeah!"<br/>
"I’ll try." (Itsuki)<br/>
On my orders, the attacks resume.<br/>
Everyone releases their strongest attacks, and the Houou in front of my eyes gets visibly weaker.<br/>
There’s a large difference between the Spirit Turtle battle, and this one.<br/>
That one took forever, but this one doesn’t seem that it’ll take too long.<br/>
That troublesome attack is… dangerous,  but I’ll try withstanding it with my Soul Eater Shield.<br/>
I instruct the supports to cast Fire Resistance periodically.<br/>
Good, I hold down Houou, as I pop a Lucor Fruit in my mouth to recover my magic.<br/>
And I cast All Revelation Aura once more after it wore off.<br/>
"Master~" (Firo)<br/>
Firo looks upon me from above.<br/>
"I need more power~" (Firo)<br/>
"Got it, come down!" (NAofumi)<br/>
"Yeah!" (Firo)<br/>
I control the Filo Rial Familia parasiting off of my body, and toss one at Firo.<br/>
The thrown ball of fluff sticks to Firo.<br/>
And it transfers its power to Firo.<br/>
"Thank you~" (Firo)<br/>
Firo spreads out her feathers, and rushes at the Higher Houou.<br/>
… Right.<br/>
Can’t I do this to the Filo Rials supporting us in the rear?<br/>
By what I’ve seen, Filo’s followers like… Piyo, was it… are in the back casting support, so if I give them these Familia… their output should increase. But that’s only if it works.<br/>
"Pii!"<br/>
As if sensing my intent, the Familia exit my body, and run towards Piyo at a high speed.<br/>
After a while, an Icon besides Firo’s popped up in my vision.<br/>
Good, this one’s for regulating magic.<br/>
Now it should get a little easier.<br/>
Next is… Should I use Come on, Raph?<br/>
I slowly look at Raphtalia.<br/>
"What is it, Naofumi-sama?" (Raphtalia)<br/>
"Come on Raph…" (Naofumi)<br/>
"Didn’t you already bring them with you!?" (Raphtalia)<br/>
Yeah, that’s right.<br/>
There’s no point in increasing their numbers at this point. And My SP will go down.<br/>
What’s more, I can’t have those guys get killed off for no reason.<br/>
Do I have anything to deal a finishing blow?<br/>
… yeah.<br/>
"Gaelion!"  (Naofumi)<br/>
"Kyua?"<br/>
"Grab Ren, and go attack the higher altitude one." (Naofumi)<br/>
"Naofumi, are you sure?" (Ren)<br/>
"We have enough firepower here. Go assist in weakening that one. Once you think that one’s about done for, release a skill in this direction." (Naofumi)<br/>
"Got it." (Ren)<br/>
In accordance with my words, Gaelion and Taniko descend.<br/>
I hope this leads to a quicker resolution.<br/>
Its recovery is annoying, but taking care of the higher one is tougher.<br/>
The lower one has a higher recovery rate, but it’s not that strong, it seems.<br/>
Ren hops on Gaelion, and flies off.<br/>
And wait… The higher one has powerful magic, so perhaps it’s weak to physical attacks.<br/>
The Queen and Sadina’s large scale magics didn’t have much of an effect, so that’s likely the case.<br/>
In this case, there’s the chance that the one below is weaker to magic.<br/>
Perhaps she sensed that I thought of something. Shadow appears before me.<br/>
"By the Queen’s analysis, we wish to try hitting this one with covenant magic-gojaru."<br/>
Oh? If it isn’t the one I know. Where did she go?<br/>
But I can figure that out later.<br/>
"Got it! Everyone separate from me! A large Scale Magic is headed this way." (Naofumi)<br/>
"What about you!?" (Atlas)<br/>
I hear Atlas’s voice, and turn to it.<br/>
"I can stand it. When the magic is over, we’ll continue attacking again." (Naofumi)<br/>
"But-" (Atlas)<br/>
"I’ll be fine. More importantly, hurry and get away." (Naofumi)<br/>
"Understood. Atlas-san, let’s go." (Raphtalia)<br/>
"… Why are you always like that?" (Atlas)<br/>
Fohl has a fed-up expression, as he drags Atlas away, with Raphtalia.<br/>
After confirming that the forces had retreated, the Queen and Sadina face me and Houou, and activate their magics.<br/>
A tornado made of water comes down on me from the sky.<br/>
Gu… I can stand it, and it doesn’t hurt or anything. But I can’t breath.<br/>
"KYUIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIII!?"<br/>
The high-pressurized whirlpool lasted around 30 seconds, but I wonder if Houou took any substantial damage.<br/>
It’s sorrowful that the attack wasn’t near Ren’s level of power, but it was around the level of a light barrage from Raphtalia and Fohl.<br/>
As I thought, the lower one was weak to magic.<br/>
For now, I think I can see the ending.<br/>
"KYUIIIIIIIIIIIIII!"<br/>
The lower one changes its body to fire, and tries rushing again.<br/>
I change my shield to the Soul Eater Shield, and stop the attack.<br/>
The attack scorches bits and pieces of my body, and I feel that I’m going to lose consciousness.<br/>
It’s a hard attack to take from the front.<br/>
And even with this, I have fire resistance cast on myself, so I wonder just how hot theses flames are.<br/>
After the rush ends, I take a deep breath, and wait for the supports to cast recovery magic on me.<br/>
And I check whether or not the higher one is going to fire his laser.<br/>
… Yeah. It seems that if the lower one doesn’t take any magic, he can’t use it.<br/>
His mouth lets off a few sparks, but nothing happens.<br/>
The problem is that the lower altitude one’s recovery didn’t stop, though. I guess that was unrelated.<br/>
We can do this. At this rate, we should be able to kill him.<br/>
If we just whittle down the lower one, and crush them together, we’ll win.<br/>
"Okay! It’ll be over soon!"<br/>
It was at the same moment I declared that.<br/>
… I would never forget the events that unfolded.<br/>
-From the very back lines, a long stream of light… something pierced the greatly weakened higher Houou.<br/>
"Wha-"<br/>
We should have waited to inflict a fatal blow, I mean, the lower one had just recovered HP, so why…<br/>
I look towards the source of the light.<br/>
It was farther back than our armies extended. Way in the distance.<br/>
What the hell was that!?<br/>
Houou’s hidden skill? Or perhaps…<br/>
No, now’s not the time for that.<br/>
"KYUIIIIIIIIII"<br/>
As if it had burned away to nothingness, the higher Houou vanishes, leaving nothing but its feathers.<br/>
The remaining feathers flutter in the wind, and scatter over the land.<br/>
This is bad…<br/>
The rear magicians had just finished chanting a large scale covenant magic.<br/>
Even though we know the lower one is weak to magic, we can’t take it out immediately.<br/>
Having regained our senses, we turn our eyes to the remaining Houou.<br/>
"KYU-"<br/>
It suddenly stopped moving altogether.<br/>
And…<br/>
Gobo…<br/>
A distorted and peculiar sound reverberated through the air.<br/>
Little by little, the Houou’s form distorted onto itself, and expanded.<br/>
Magic and heat condensed around it.<br/>
"Everyone attack it at once! Quickly, we need to kill him as quickly as possible!"<br/>
We don’t even have the time to retreat. It’ll blow up in seconds.<br/>
We have to kill it before that, or the area will become a sea of flame.<br/>
「Meteor Sword」! 「Gravity Blade」! 「Hundred Sword」!<br/>
「Meteor Spear」! 「Brionac」! 「First Javelin」! 「Second Javelin」!<br/>
「Meteor Bow」! 「Bird Hunting」! 「Spread Arrow」!<br/>
Without even taking a breath,the heroes let out consecutive skills.<br/>
「Erst Throw」! 「Zweit Throw」! 「Dritte Throw」! 「Tornado Throw」!<br/>
「Bagua Karma Blade Consecutive Blows」! 「First Stroke」! 「Second Stroke」! 「Third Stroke」!<br/>
「Tiger Break」!<br/>
「High Quick」! 「Spiral Strike」!<br/>
"Naofumi-sama! We have to kill it quickly! Tei!"<br/>
Atlas quickly starts pricking Houou’s vital points.<br/>
We’re truly desperate! I raise Gaelion’s abilities by equipping my Wrath Shield.<br/>
Eroding my Heart? Like I care!<br/>
Giant Dragon Gaelion seems to understand the situation. He shoots a magic breath at Houou<br/>
「Prominence Dark Nova」!<br/>
With Taniko’s assistance, he immediately releases his strongest breath.<br/>
"Pierce through! 「Shield Prison」! 「Change Shield (Attack)」! 「Iron Maiden」!"<br/>
Right after Gaelion’s breath hits him, I bind him in my Shield Prison.<br/>
Of course, I strengthened it with my SP and EP, but that is only temporary.<br/>
And using all of my remaining SP, I summon an Iron Maiden. It shatters the chains of my Prison, and eats Houou whole.<br/>
"Haa… hah… ha…" (Naofumi)<br/>
I take out and drink some Spirit Water just in case. I wait for the Iron Maiden to wear off.<br/>
"D-did we do it?"<br/>
"S-somehow."<br/>
Everyone is out of breath after that extreme barrage.<br/>
I even ended up using my Wrath Shield.<br/>
With this…<br/>
Snap…<br/>
Just before the Iron Maiden was about to wear off, the maiden of steel burst.<br/>
Inside was a swelling Houou, that had gotten too large to contain.<br/>
Gu… the cooldown time is…<br/>
"Damn! We can’t be killed off here."<br/>
In order to prevent further casualty, I’ll stain my hands with the move that I was still recovering from.<br/>
「Blutopfer」!<br/>
I immediately chant, and release my Curse Skill.<br/>
Gu… blood spouts from all over my body.<br/>
"Naofumi-sama!?" (Atlas)<br/>
"Naofumi-sama!" (Raphtalia)<br/>
Ren, Motoyasu and Itsuki didn’t have the confidence to use their curse skills without getting swallowed by their curses.<br/>
They’re forbidden skills we can never get used to using, andthere’s no time to think of something new on the fly.<br/>
Then I just have to do it myself.<br/>
I took heavy damage, as I release my Blutopfer at the expanding Houou.<br/>
Good!<br/>
From the ground, a tiger trap that resembled the mouth of a raging dragon emerged, and closed on…<br/>
"Wha!?"<br/>
With a bang, Houou burst!<br/>
Losing its target, the trap gets enveloped by the flames.<br/>
I sway back and forth, as I step in front of everyone. In order to contain the explosion, I use the skill I thought up with Atlas, Collect.<br/>
At the moment, if we get hit by this, everyone besides me will probably die.<br/>
Perhaps the Heroes will be able to stand it, but the Army and the Slaves are here too.<br/>
I can’t stand down.<br/>
Where Houou was standing, is now a ball of fire as brilliant as the sun.<br/>
And it’s still expanding. The ground below it scorches and melts. Nothing is left in its path.<br/>
At the same time, far, far away… the flames could be seen, even from Melromark.<br/>
