<br/>
The shining giant warped its mouth as if happy and began talking.<br/>
"…People, huh." <br/>
Low.<br/>
It was as if he was speaking from a giant speaker in a low tone that reverberates right down to the pit of my stomach.<br/>
Fuji-yan is still holding his head muttering something.<br/>
Nina-san has taken a stance with Fuji-yan at her back.<br/>
Lucy has her mouth wide open with a pale face.<br/>
I pulled the hand of Lucy, got close to Fuji-yan and Nina-san to the point our shoulders are almost touching.<br/>
I am maintaining my calm with [Clear Mind].<br/>
Fuji-yan has a dungeon escape item.<br/>
Right now he is panicking, but using that to get everyone to a safe place is the best choice. It would be best to gather at one place as much as possible. <br/>
But let’s watch the situation for a bit first.<br/>
The reaction of the Detection is weird.<br/>
This guy might not be a bad guy, that kind of positive thinking appeared in my mind.<br/>
"…Let me thank you. The seal has been undone thanks to you guys." <br/>
Did we do something?<br/>
My eyes naturally went to Lucy.<br/>
"?!"<br/>
Lucy shakes her head to the sides.<br/>
‘It is not me!’, is the face she is making, but didn’t you touch the magic crystal a few moments ago?<br/>
Was it Lucy?, is what I thought, but it wasn’t.<br/>
"It was me… Using [Appraisal] was a bad thing…" (Fujiwara)<br/>
Fuji-yan answers with a trembling voice.<br/>
"…I was defeated in the war and was casted a petrification seal… That seal may have weakened after a long passing of time, but it wasn’t something I could undo on my own. I needed someone to be aware of me." <br/>
"Huh…there’s things like that too, huh." (Makoto)<br/>
But if that’s the case, then it is not as if Fuji-yan is at fault.<br/>
"Anyone would appraise that giant crystal. It can’t be helped." (Makoto)<br/>
Fuji-yan may be depressed by it, but he didn’t mean harm.<br/>
"…Your average eye cannot break through my seal… Unless you have the God Eyes that can see through even the disguise of Gods." <br/>
"God Eyes…" (Makoto)<br/>
Did Fuji-yan have a skill like that? <br/>
No, he said Appraisal, so maybe it means that his Appraisal skill is god-like?<br/>
"My Appraisal isn’t god level, you know…" (Fujiwara)<br/>
Fuji-yan denies my conjecture.<br/>
"…I don’t know… But the seal was undone… That’s what matters." <br/>
Meaning that we saved this giant, basically.<br/>
Words get through him and it doesn’t look like we will get attacked. <br/>
That’s what I was thinking.<br/>
"…I am hungry." <br/>
Until he said that.<br/>
The giant was staring intently at us.<br/>
Oi oi, aren’t we your benefactors?<br/>
Don’t look at us with those eyes. <br/>
A chill ran down my back.<br/>
"[R-Return]!" (Nina)<br/>
Nina-san takes the item from Fuji-yan and activates it.<br/>
What a relief! I didn’t know how to use it.<br/>
We four were covered in light and when the light went out, we were standing in front of the cave.<br/>
We are safe now.<br/>
No, not yet.<br/>
"Let’s move away from here." (Makoto)<br/>
This place is dangerous.<br/>
"I-Is it okay to leave that?" (Lucy)<br/>
Lucy asks in a scared voice.<br/>
"Let’s go back and report it to the guild!" (Nina)<br/>
It is as Nina-san says.<br/>
"…"<br/>
Fuji-yan is still depressed.<br/>
"Let’s all return to the city. That guy from before might be chasing after us." (Makoto)<br/>
Everyone nodded lightly and we were about to return to the city when…<br/>
*Crack!*<br/>
The ground in front of us swelled.<br/>
It was visibly changing to a humanoid shape.<br/>
And then, it began to shine dully.<br/>
"…Where are you going?" <br/>
This is bad…<br/>
What’s with this guy?<br/>
We can’t run away from him.<br/>
"Goshujin-sama! Please run away!" (Nina)<br/>
Nina-san heads towards the giant.<br/>
"Y-You musn’t! Don’t fight him!" <br/>
Fuji-yan shouts in panic, but it was too late.<br/>
Nina-san’s kick was about to hit the head of the giant.<br/>
*Bong!*<br/>
A dull sound like hitting a bell echoed.<br/>
The giant just waited to get kicked.<br/>
Could it be that it is slow?<br/>
"…Wait." <br/>
The giant’s right hand moved.<br/>
"Eh?" (Nina)<br/>
Nina-san intended to move away as soon as she finished the attack. She tried to do exactly that…but the giant’s movement was so fast that she couldn’t react. <br/>
The giant looked like it moved slowly.<br/>
But by the time we noticed, the fingertip of the giant had slightly touched Nina-san.<br/>
Nina-san was sent flying.<br/>
"Gahagh!!" (Nina)<br/>
*Blam!*<br/>
She crashed onto a faraway tree and collapsed.<br/>
Seriously?! Nina-san is a Silver Rank, you know.<br/>
He defeated her in a single hit.<br/>
"Fuji-yan, what is that?!" (Makoto)<br/>
"It said that it is an Evil Giant God that incurred the rage of the Holy Gods… According to my Appraisal, the seal had been undone… That’s all I could tell." (Fujiwara)<br/>
Evil Giant God…<br/>
It certainly is a dangerous sounding title.<br/>
"Fuji-yan, please heal Nina-san with a healing item. I will buy time with Lucy." (Makoto)<br/>
"Understood! Please don’t push yourself." (Fujiwara)<br/>
Fuji-yan runs towards Nina-san.<br/>
Lucy is chanting at my side.<br/>
Normally, she wouldn’t make it in time, but the giant is taking its time when moving. But I don’t know if he will be making that mysterious move that he did when attacking Nina-san.<br/>
"[F-Firestorm]!" (Lucy)<br/>
This time she made it in time.<br/>
A fire storm even bigger than the time with the Griffon was swirling with the giant at the center of it.<br/>
"Incredible, Lucy! That’s High Grade Magic." (Makoto)<br/>
"I can succeed 1 out of 10 times!" (Lucy)<br/>
So you pulled a 10% chance.<br/>
I thought ‘don’t go crossing a dangerous bridge like that’, but I don’t think a normal spell will be working against the giant.<br/>
The firestorm was burning continuously as if it were trying to burn the sky.<br/>
"Alright, it should have damaged it somewhat. Let’s run together with Nina-san and Fuji-yan." (Makoto)<br/>
"W-Wait, I am not used to High Grade Magic, so I might have gotten a bit Mana Dizzy." (Lucy)<br/>
It is something that a low mana person like me can’t relate to, but people with high mana like Lucy seem to get dizzy as if they were drunk from alcohol after using a strong spell and activating the mana from their whole body.<br/>
Fuji-yan is using the healing item on Nina-san.<br/>
Good, with this…<br/>
The ground trembled.<br/>
The birds in the forest all flew away at the same time. <br/>
I could hear the scared cries of animals from far away. It might be the cries of monsters.<br/>
When I hesitantly turned back, I could see the giant slowly coming out from the firestorm.<br/>
"…Unscathed?" (Lucy)<br/>
The voice of Lucy is trembling.<br/>
If I didn’t have Clear Mind, my heart might have broken too. <br/>
An enemy that the High Grade Magic of Lucy isn’t effective against.<br/>
An enemy we cannot deal with.<br/>
I want to run away, but the enemy is using a strange movement method.<br/>
"Lucy, run away with Fuji-yan and Nina-san." (Makoto)<br/>
I tell her in a low voice.<br/>
"A-And you, M-Makoto?" (Lucy)<br/>
"I will buy time." (Makoto)<br/>
"[XXXXXXXXXXX (Water Overflow)], [Water Magic: Mist]." (Makoto)<br/>
I change the generated water from Spirit Magic into mist.<br/>
The surroundings get covered in mist in an instant. <br/>
"…Spirit Magic, huh." <br/>
I hear the low tone of the giant.<br/>
"Lucy, go." (Makoto)<br/>
"B-But!" (Lucy)<br/>
"Fuji-yan is an important friend of mine. I am counting on you." (Makoto)<br/>
"…I won’t forgive you if you die." (Lucy)<br/>
"Alright." (Makoto)<br/>
She is saying the same thing as the Goddess.<br/>
But it is rare that the Goddess isn’t saying anything herself.<br/>
Give me some advice here…<br/>
*Thum!*<br/>
The mist is dyeing my vision completely white, but the giant seems to be heading our way.<br/>
Lucy ran to where Fuji-yan is.<br/>
The vision is zero, but Lucy’s ears are good.<br/>
She should be able to regroup with him.<br/>
Okay, let’s do this.<br/>
[Stealth].<br/>
I activate my skill.<br/>
The plan is simple.<br/>
I take away the vision of the enemy with the mist and cut him with the Goddess’s dagger, and then once again hide with Stealth.<br/>
It is a haphazard plan that relies on the enemy stopping its feet not knowing where I am.<br/>
A giant that Nina-san’s kicks and Lucy’s magic doesn’t work on.<br/>
It is like confirming that my magic won’t work, but if it is the dagger of the Goddess…<br/>
*Thum! Thum!*<br/>
The footsteps were getting closer.<br/>
I hold my breath and wait for the giant to pass.<br/>
I was planning on getting it from the back, and if possible the ankle.<br/>
If I do that, I should be able to stop his movements.<br/>
"…What are you doing?" <br/>
"?!" <br/>
The giant’s hand was stretching to where I am.<br/>
Why?! <br/>
Stealth isn’t working?<br/>
This is bad! I am gonna get caught!<br/>
If that happens, I won’t be able to escape.<br/>
No, I would get eaten.<br/>
[Evade].<br/>
The giant’s hand got despairingly close, but I swung my dagger like crazy while I activated my skill.<br/>
I felt no hit.<br/>
I luckily managed to escape from the hand of the giant.<br/>
I am saved.<br/>
"What did you do?!" <br/>
The giant’s voice suddenly sounded furious.<br/>
"You…" <br/>
The voice that sounded gentle until now had anger mixed to it.<br/>
The ground shook and a gust of wind removed the mist.<br/>
"Eh?" (Makoto)<br/>
1 finger of the giant…is missing?<br/>
I cut it off?<br/>
I didn’t feel like it hit at all though.<br/>
"…Where did you get…that dagger?" <br/>
Would it be better to be honest and say that I got from the Goddess?<br/>
"That’s something that’s beyond the hand of mortals…" <br/>
"Eh?" (Makoto)<br/>
By the time I noticed, the giant was in front of me.<br/>
I didn’t even have the time to avoid it, my body was grabbed.<br/>
I can’t run away.<br/>
With both hands of the giant restraining my body, the giant brought me close to his face.<br/>
He looked at me with a gigantic eye that was about the same size as my head.<br/>
I-I am gonna be eaten!<br/>
Aah, my adventure has ended here…<br/>
"Wait!" <br/>
What resonated was the voice of the Goddess from the heavens.<br/>
