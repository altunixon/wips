Chapter 238: Chasing Too Far<br/>
Ren and Motoyasu are Heroes, so I can’t kill them, and there are some things I need to make Witch do, so I’d like to leave her (barely) alive if possible.<br/>
But these guys are different.<br/>
In fact, in order to prevent them from harming more people, it’s best to make them leave the stage early. For the sake of the world.<br/>
"And, like, did you seriously think you could beat me with such low power?" (Naofumi)<br/>
A possibility is that Armor challenged Ren when he was a bandit and thought he could beat me if that was my power level. But, the Ren of that time had not yet learned strengthening methods.<br/>
To face me, he kept himself in perfect condition and got his hands on the strongest equipment he could find.<br/>
He used brainwashing to amass an army to wear me down so he could strike the finishing blow.<br/>
But those assaults had pretty much no effect on me.<br/>
He seriously underestimated his enemy. I should use this as reference. (TL: Learn from his mistakes)<br/>
Though, I have no idea if an enemy with that large of a gap in strength will ever appear before me. I have no idea how strong Houou is supposed to be.<br/>
I should do what I can for now.<br/>
My current mission is to take care of this ridiculous farce.<br/>
"You’re cowardly otherworlder who does nothing but rely on the strength of your Legendary Weapon! This World will be saved by its own people!" (Armor)<br/>
"Cowardly… You’re in no position to tell me that!" (Naofumi)<br/>
You people arbitrarily summoned me. I don’t need your complaints.<br/>
What is this person even trying to say?<br/>
It doesn’t seem that words are getting through.<br/>
Though I get the feeling they weren’t getting through from the start.<br/>
"This world’s people will save themselves? That’s quite a noble thought, but it was those very same people who decided to rely on the heroes and perform a summoning ritual. Your argument lacks persuasive power." (Naofumi)<br/>
And just because you happened to summon someone you didn’t like, why must you abandon him?<br/>
I should direct those words at Trash.<br/>
The Queen supported me to the best of her ability, but it seems the country has lost some economic power.<br/>
When I see her tackling a mountain of paperwork, I find it hard to ask for funding.<br/>
I acknowledge that I may be a devil, but at least I have a conscience.<br/>
I’m surprised she hasn’t ruined her body from stress yet.<br/>
No, perhaps she has.<br/>
I’ve seen her swallowing medicine before.<br/>
She’s also been patting her stomach. She’s definitely acquired stress ulcers.<br/>
Now that I think about it, how’s the Castle Town doing?<br/>
I think Motoyasu and his Filo Rials will be able to suppress any uprisings.<br/>
I also sent a messenger to Raphtalia’s group when this mess started, so I wonder what happened to them.<br/>
… It’s been around half a day since this mess started.<br/>
If Raphtalia immediately came running back, I would suspect her of being brainwashed.<br/>
"Anyways, it’s best for your sake if you honestly tell the whole story." (Naofumi)<br/>
From the Magic User’s testimony, this guy’s the ringleader. Perhaps I can wring Witch’s location out of him.<br/>
"If you don’t, my subordinates will torture you until you wish you were dead." (Naofumi)<br/>
"Naofumi-sama, leave it to me." (Atlas)<br/>
Atlas happily starts shadowboxing. She punches the air in front of her.<br/>
What’s with her movements?<br/>
"Yeah, Firo wants to do it too." (Firo)<br/>
Firo begins imitating her.<br/>
Is that the new fad? Not on my watch.<br/>
When I turn around, I find that the others of my group have driven the brainwashed people outside and are in the process of setting up a barricade.<br/>
And just like I’m doing, Taniko borrowed a dagger from Ren, and began threatening the Three Hero Church remnants.<br/>
Ren cautions her that she shouldn’t be doing such things, but she shouts at him to shut up.<br/>
Gaelion has a delicate expression on his face.<br/>
I wonder who the girl takes after.<br/>
Rishia has just finished binding all of the remnants.<br/>
In the confusion created from throwing the bomb, they had scattered all over the place inside of the spacious church.<br/>
Rishia’s quite skilled.<br/>
She even ran on the walls… though I don’t know the logistics behind it.<br/>
Could she be concentrating magic on her feet to temporarily bind them or something?<br/>
Perhaps she’ll be able to run on water as well.<br/>
Hey, I told you people to kill them…<br/>
"Hey… just talk. You’ll lengthen your lifespan by a bit." (Naofumi)<br/>
As I declare this, Armor retreats a few steps and catches his breath.<br/>
Has he finally gotten a grasp of the situation he’s in?<br/>
His face is blue.<br/>
He assured himself that he would win and that his enemies were all evil, and now it’s come to this.<br/>
Caught up in Itsuki’s justice, he began to believe that he was justice itself.<br/>
"I’m waiting." (Naofumi)<br/>
"Ku… If I have to talk to you, then I’d rather di-" (Armor)<br/>
Just as he was speaking…<br/>
The roof of the church caves in, and three brainwashed Filo Rials rain down from the sky.<br/>
"Wha-" (Armor)<br/>
"KUEEEEEEE!" (Filo Rial)<br/>
"You’re in the way!" (Firo)<br/>
"Please, Move!" (Atlas)<br/>
Two of them grapple with Firo and Atlas while the last one forcefully throws Armor on its back and starts running.<br/>
"Like I’d let that happen!" (Naofumi)<br/>
Just as I’m about to deploy Shield Prison, I remember something.<br/>
Where are they running to?<br/>
I thought I would leave Itsuki up to Kiel, but if I follow them there, I may find Witch and her compatriots. I can capture them all at once.<br/>
And it seems that Armor would rather commit suicide than be captured.<br/>
There’s no point in capturing a dead man.<br/>
So I should use him as much as I can while he lives.<br/>
"Move!" (Firo)<br/>
Firo kicks away the Filo Rial blocking her and begins to give chase.<br/>
With her speed, catching up will be easy, but the destination is the important part.<br/>
The situation is this dire. It’s probably not a trap.<br/>
If we just manage to find the enemy stronghold, then no matter the situation, we’ll be able to apprehend them sooner or later.<br/>
Of course, if they run towards Castle Town, I have no intention of letting them get far because I’ll probably find Witch and Itsuki there.<br/>
"Wait, let’s chase them too far!" (Naofumi)<br/>
(TL: I can’t think of an English alternative. Pretty much, the term means to pursue a goal too far, and is usually used with a negative connotation, but Naofumi means to chase them to the end.)<br/>
What’s with that line?<br/>
It’s something I said myself, but I have no idea what it means.<br/>
Aren’t you usually supposed to say ‘Don’t chase them too far’?<br/>
Well, I do plan on pursuing them until the end.<br/>
"What’s wrong Master? You don’t want to capture them?" (Firo)<br/>
"If they’re going to run… then we’ll just use that. Haha. It’s hunting time." (Naofumi)<br/>
"As expected of Naofumi-sama. You let one escape to capture them all, right?" (Atlas)<br/>
"You can see through everything, can’t you?" (Naofumi)<br/>
Atlas’s comprehension ability is scary.<br/>
Could this be an instinct of the militaristic Hakuko tribe?<br/>
She can cut off her anxiety and calmly view the situation.<br/>
For now, I should get the Filo Rials on our side. They’re Motoyasu’s, so their stats aren’t bad.<br/>
I lock the one Firo kicked away in my Prison.<br/>
"Good. Now, you guys will be bringing the Three Hero Church Remnants to Melty’s estate! I’m leaving Gaelion’s group in charge." (Naofumi)<br/>
"Understood!"<br/>
As if they were expecting the order, Rishia and Taniko were already holding a net which they use to hold the Three Hero Church Remnants together after gathering them in one place.<br/>
The situation reminds me of a large haul of fish on a fishing boat.<br/>
All of the Remnants are directing foul language at my group.<br/>
It’s truly a stupid sight. I’ll apply some torture later.<br/>
If I don’t let them suffer a bit, I won’t be able to calm down.<br/>
… For this to be a possible stress-reliever… I’ve changed as well.<br/>
In a bad way.<br/>
Though, I have no intentions of correcting myself.<br/>
"Gaelion, you catch up with us later. And Taniko, I’ll leave the command of the people at the mansion to you." (Naofumi)<br/>
"Taniko!? Do you mean me?" (Taniko)<br/>
"I told you before, right? Why are you so surprised?" (Naofumi)<br/>
"No, I knew! But hearing it directly is…" (Taniko)<br/>
"I’ll pursue the cause of this ruckus. You guys should focus on suppressing the violence in this village. Tell Kiel, who’s supposed to be good at tracking, to follow me." (Naofumi)<br/>
"Understood." (Taniko)<br/>
"And after you deliver that message, send Gaelion over. Decide whether you’ll come or not based on the situation." (Naofumi)<br/>
Taniko nods at all of my orders.<br/>
"Then everyone else is following that Armor with me. Get on a Filo Rial." (Naofumi)<br/>
"Understood." (Rishiua)<br/>
"Let’s go!" (Naofumi)<br/>
"Ya~y!" (Firo)<br/>
With Firo at the head, Rishia, Atlas, and Ren all board Filo Rials and follow to chase Armor.<br/>
"Are you sure they went this way?" (Naofumi)<br/>
"Yeah, I thought that if we were too close, they’d notice, so Firo is keeping some distance." (Firo)<br/>
. . .<br/>
Without any lights, we rely on Firo’s instinct to give chase. It’s already been two hours.<br/>
All of the Filo Rials from my place are quite fast.<br/>
Without a cart, their normal running gait is around the max speed of a wild Filo Rial.<br/>
And such an amazing Filo Rial is running at full speed with Armor. They’re already outside of my territory and on the mountain roads.<br/>
I wonder where they’re running to.<br/>
But, I’m not about to waste time. Atop Firo’s back, I begin Reinforcing the Spirit Turtle Shell.<br/>
It will take a while before it awakens, but I’ve already managed to raise its abilities beyond Soul Eater Shield.<br/>
What’s more, it has a Growing Power ability, so I can’t wait to see what happens next.<br/>
As expected of the Shield the Old Man made.<br/>
Ah, right. About the non-copy one, I had it carefully packaged and sent to the Mansion with Taniko.<br/>
It may get taken again, but taking it with me here would provide the highest chance of it getting scratched.<br/>
I won’t let anyone touch it.<br/>
I don’t think it will be able to get any more skills, but it’s still an amazing Shield.<br/>
By the way, I tested out Reflect Shield to find out its ability.<br/>
When I shouted out the skill name, a list of the Shields I had with offensive power popped up.<br/>
There are a few I can’t choose, but it seems this ability can temporarily give my Shield some offensive features.<br/>
It will be useful for attacking when using shields with high defense.<br/>
E Float Shield → Change Shield → Reflect Shield is also a possible combination.<br/>
Then, the manifested shield can have greater durability.<br/>
My possibilities have increased.<br/>
"Master, it seems they’ve entered a building." (Firo)<br/>
There’s a building out here?<br/>
I see a mountain fortress with some traces of light leaking out of it.<br/>
We’ve finally discovered their base.<br/>
I’ll make this a splendid massacre.<br/>
"Is that their stronghold?" (Ren)<br/>
"Seems like it." (Naofumi)<br/>
I nod at Ren’s question.<br/>
Though it could just be a resting spot, it’s a fortress built in the middle of the mountains.<br/>
There’s a high probability that it’s an important point.<br/>
They’re probably recycling a fortress abandoned by the country.<br/>
It would be nice if Witch were somewhere here, but…<br/>
"Itsuki-sama…" (Rishia)<br/>
He may be there.<br/>
Either way, we’ll have to apprehend them.<br/>
But, Armor sure is a fool. Did he think he had outrun us?<br/>
That Filo Rial used to be mine, you know.<br/>
But I guess he had no choice but to run.<br/>
‘It was all a trap, now die Demon Lord!’ is also a possibility.<br/>
But I have confidence I’ll win. He’s a small fry.<br/>
I don’t know his level, but he wasn’t even able to scratch me when his blade was in direct contact with my skin.<br/>
At this rate, whether it be the Three Hero Church, the Nobles, Witch, the Rebels, or Armor, I don’t think any of them can hurt me.<br/>
It would be strange for them to have someone with such capabilities.<br/>
… Now that I think about it, can the current me only be hurt with attacks on Curse-Series-level strength?<br/>
Then, my first objective should be to defeat Itsuki.<br/>
And with me are Firo, Atlas, Rishia, Ren, and the other Filo Rials. A perfect Battle Party.<br/>
With this party, it will be easy to capture him alive.<br/>
… The only problem would be if Rishia betrays us, but I have an idea for that.<br/>
"What’s wrong, Master?" (Firo)<br/>
But, I can be certain that some of my own brainwashed subordinates are there as well.<br/>
I’m also taking that into account.<br/>
Firo and Ren can only inflict fatal blows, so I’ll save them for enemy management and Itsuki.<br/>
Atlas and Rishia can manipulate the invisible force of Chi, so I should send them to deal with the brainwashed slaves.<br/>
Anyways, to stop two Heroes, a Filo Rial Queen, and an awakened Rishia, is probably impossible.<br/>
All that’s left is to trample them.<br/>
"Now then, Itsuki or Witch… Who’s hiding here?" (Naofumi)<br/>
<br/>
