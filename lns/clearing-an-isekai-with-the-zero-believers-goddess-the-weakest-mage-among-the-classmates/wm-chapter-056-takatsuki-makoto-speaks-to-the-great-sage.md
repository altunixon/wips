<br/>
What should I do…? <br/>
If I follow the advice of the Goddess, it would be better to not enter.<br/>
But, after coming all the way here?<br/>
"Are you here, Great Sage-sama?" (Sakurai)<br/>
There’s no response from the call of Sakurai-kun.<br/>
"Maybe she isn’t present?" (Lucy)<br/>
Alright, let’s go back! <br/>
"Eh? Great Sage-sama, have only them enter? …Okay…okay…understood." (Sakurai)<br/>
"…Sakurai-kun, what happened all of a sudden?" (Makoto)<br/>
I get scared by Sakurai-kun who was talking to himself all of a sudden.<br/>
"A thought transmission from the Great Sage-sama came. She told me that only you guys will be entering." (Sakurai)<br/>
"Eeh?" (Makoto)<br/>
My uneasiness increases.<br/>
While I was hesitating, Sakurai-kun pushed us in.<br/>
◇◇<br/>
"Excuse the intrusion…" (Makoto)<br/>
The inside of the tent is dark, and there’s magic lanterns floating in the air.<br/>
It was overflowing with things making a pseudo-passage that led deeper inside. <br/>
At the end of that passage, there’s a small mage in white robe sitting on a giant sofa.<br/>
Should we go there? <br/>
"Come closer. It is hard to speak from there." <br/>
Despite her title, it was the voice of a young girl. <br/>
I got a few meters closer to her just as she asked, and I could now see the pure white hair that was hidden within her white hood.<br/>
It certainly is the White Great Sage.<br/>
"I am the apprentice magician, Takatsuki Makoto. The ones here are my comrades: Lucy Walker, and Sasaki Aya." (Makoto)<br/>
"Nice to meet you." (Lucy)<br/>
"Hello." (Aya)<br/>
"Fumu." <br/>
The Great Sage-sama walks over to us and looks at all of us.<br/>
Her red eyes that felt like they pierced through me were testament to her insight.<br/>
She has a pretty little girl face, but there’s a ghastliness to it that makes my back shiver.<br/>
How old is she? I don’t think she is as old as her appearance states.<br/>
"You, you are the half of an elf and demon, huh", she says while looking at Lucy.<br/>
I was shocked.<br/>
I look at Lucy.<br/>
She stiffened in place.<br/>
"You there are a Lamia, huh. Moreover, on a level that can be designated as a Calamity. Interesting." <br/>
The Great Sage grins.<br/>
This is bad! <br/>
This person has the Appraisal Skill! <br/>
I looked at Sa-san, and it seems like she didn’t understand the situation and was dumbfounded.<br/>
Kuh, this is bad.<br/>
Demons and monsters are hunt targets! <br/>
I should have listened to the warning of the Goddess! <br/>
"Don’t get so on edge. You helped the Light Hero boy, right? Spirit Users in this day and age are rare. I wanted to meet you. Moreover, your comrades are quite the bundle of unique traits." <br/>
The Great Sage still had that grin. <br/>
…Does that mean she doesn’t mind that they are a demon and monster?<br/>
"Looks like I scared you. Sit here. I will at least pour some tea." <br/>
There were old-looking chairs around a round table that also looked pretty old.<br/>
Are they antiques?<br/>
"You sit here." <br/>
For some reason, I was told to sit by the side of the Great Sage.<br/>
I-I’m nervous.<br/>
I thought that there would be a servant or something, but the teapot floated its way here, and the tea cups were placed in front of us.<br/>
When the tea was poured, a nice scent wafted around.<br/>
She does her daily life using magic?<br/>
People with mana to spare have it nice.<br/>
"For treats…well, this should do." <br/>
A big plate with a variety of pastries suddenly appeared in front of us with a loud thud.<br/>
Where did she bring these pastries from just now…?<br/>
"Is this Teleport?" (Makoto)<br/>
"Hoh, I am impressed you could tell." <br/>
C-Chantless Teleport Magic.<br/>
This person is on a whole other plane…<br/>
We must not fight her.<br/>
Or more like, I don’t think we can even run away…<br/>
"And so, what business did you have with us?" (Aya)<br/>
Sa-san was already munching on the pastries.<br/>
Hey, show some restraint! <br/>
"I told you already, didn’t I? I was simply interested. I heard about this Spirit User that managed to drag out the Taboo Dragons with Monarch Magic. From my calculations, I predicted the Light Hero Boy would take 1 month to finish this task." <br/>
"I heard that if you helped, it would have ended in an instant." (Makoto)<br/>
I remember the words Yokoyama-san said.<br/>
"That won’t serve as training. The Great Demon Lord will be reviving. Having the Light Hero getting troubled with 2 mere Taboo Dragons would be problematic." <br/>
I see.<br/>
So she purposely didn’t help.<br/>
"By the way…the red haired mage over there." <br/>
"Y-Yes?!" (Lucy)<br/>
Lucy seems to be nervous, she is not speaking much.<br/>
"You, have you noticed that your body is being burned by your own mana?" <br/>
"Eh?" (Lucy)<br/>
Lucy had an expression of surprise, and me too.<br/>
"Did you think that was your constitution? That body heat of yours is the result of your mana running out of control, you know?"<br/>
"W-What should I do…?" (Lucy)<br/>
"I will give you this. Put it on." <br/>
The Great Sage gave Lucy a bracelet that was lying around.<br/>
"An item that calms down the flow of mana. It is an item that’s worth the price of a house. Treat it with care." <br/>
"I-Is that okay?" (Makoto)<br/>
Being a wary person, I ask in fear.<br/>
Isn’t this person a bit too kind?<br/>
She won’t be demanding a crazy amount of money later, right? <br/>
"We are currently searching for strong talents after all. We can’t let capable mages sleep. Oi, the lamia there who only eats." <br/>
This time she looks at Sa-san.<br/>
"Yeph?" (Aya)<br/>
Sa-san! At least swallow before replying.<br/>
"The [Change] Skill that you have is powerful. You don’t have to turn into that half-assed human form with bluish skin, you can transform into a perfect human. Not only that, it is a skill that lets you transform into anything. Even a Dragon or Demon." <Switched Transformation of Aya to Change.><br/>
"Hm? It was taught to me by my sisters as Human Transformation Magic though." (Aya)<br/>
"That’s a skill that Lamias have. Your skill is above that." <br/>
"Hoh, is that so… Thank you very much." (Aya)<br/>
That’s incredible. <br/>
This person gives useful items and advice. <br/>
Isn’t she a support character?<br/>
"So, the problem is you, Spirit User-kun." <br/>
"…I am a normal human." (Makoto)<br/>
"Hooh." <br/>
The eyes of the Great Sage curved into a smile, and a hand was placed on my head.<br/>
Her fingers are cold like Sa-san’s.<br/>
"Let’s look at your Status. It is easier to do Appraisal when my hand is in contact… You have quite the one-sided Stats. Even though they are extremely low, your Water Proficiency is abnormally high." <br/>
It is kinda ticklish.<br/>
"Muuh…this ain’t good." <br/>
She suddenly grabbed my head.<br/>
"You…are the believer of an Evil God?"<br/>
Time froze.<br/>
◇◇<br/>
 ""……""<br/>
Lucy and I were silent.<br/>
Only the sound of Sa-san munching on pastry could be heard.<br/>
"No, you are mistaken." (Makoto)<br/>
For now, I try to fool her with a smile.<br/>
An Evil God believer is guilty no questions asked.<br/>
It is the common knowledge of Fuji-yan, Nina-san, and Lucy.<br/>
"The believer of the Evil God Noah, huh… You are the second I have met." <br/>
The Great Sage is making a complicated expression.<br/>
Her small hand is still holding my head.<br/>
"No…as I said, isn’t there some sort of mistake here…?" (Makoto)<br/>
"If I remember correctly, 1,000 years ago…it was one of the 9 Demon Generals serving under the Great Demon Lord, the Forbidden Black Knight." <br/>
"Eh? The legendary Hero Killer?" (Lucy)<br/>
Lucy says.<br/>
What’s that?<br/>
"Lucy, who is the Forbidden Black Knight?" (Makoto)<br/>
"The sworn enemy of humanity that appears in the story of the Saviour-sama. It is said that he is the right hand of the Great Demon Lord, and a legendary warrior that slaughtered everyone except the Light Hero. In the end, he was defeated by the Saviour Abel… That is the Apostle of the Evil God Noah…?" (Lucy)<br/>
Lucy who was saying this began to feel anxious.<br/>
Eh, what are you doing, Noah-sama?<br/>
I didn’t hear anything about this.<br/>
"But…the Apostle of the Evil God was a lot crazier than you. At the very least, he couldn’t hold a proper conversation." <br/>
How was he, my Apostle senpai.<br/>
"You speak as if you saw him personally." (Makoto)<br/>
"Yeah…I have the memories of 1,000 years ago after all." <br/>
Is it the so-called Inherit Skill?<br/>
"Will you continue being the Apostle of the Evil God?" <br/>
The Great Sage-sama asks.<br/>
H-How should I answer this?<br/>
"No, as I said…I am not the believer of an Evil God…" (Makoto)<br/>
It is getting painful already, but I continue making the same excuse.<br/>
"Fumu…well, let’s leave it at that." <br/>
She let go of my head.<br/>
And then, she rustled my hair.<br/>
"When you guys come to Highland, come to my place. I will train you people." <br/>
Eh? Done?<br/>
"U-Uhm…is it okay?" (Makoto)<br/>
We are talking about a demon, a monster, and the Apostle of an Evil God.<br/>
It is triple the trouble and I feel like it is a red flag party though.<br/>
Is she gonna let us go?<br/>
"I said this before. I want to get as many talented people as possible for when the Great Demon Lord revives. If you guys turn into enemies, I will take responsibility and end you." <br/>
She smiles. Scary.<br/>
"We don’t have any intentions of fighting the Great Demon Lord though." (Makoto)<br/>
"Eh, really, Takatsuki-kun?" (Aya)<br/>
Sa-san, why are you making a face as if it was unexpected?<br/>
I am not a hero, and I am not strong.<br/>
"When the Great Demon Lord revives, the people will fall into a war with the demons. If we lose the war, everyone will become the livestock of the demons." <br/>
"…"<br/>
Meaning that we can’t run away, huh.<br/>
"Spirit User-kun, I recommend you to stop being the Apostle of the Evil God by the next time we meet. Obeying that Evil God will only end in misery." <br/>
Saying this, the Great Sage-sama lies sideways on the sofa.<br/>
In the end, she was a good person who gave us items and advice.<br/>
If only the last part of the conversation wasn’t there, it would have been the best though…<br/>
◇◇<br/>
We return to our table with hazy feelings. The banquet was close to ending. <br/>
I sobered up already.<br/>
My appetite is gone too.<br/>
I was spacing out with a blank head.<br/>
"Takatsuki-sama, there’s a guest", Nina-san pokes my shoulder.<br/>
The one there was the Water Oracle, the Princess of Rozes, Sofia Rozes. <br/>
