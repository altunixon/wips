<Author's Note: From the point of view of the worker's guild elf manager.><br/>
<br/>
Intermission: The Work of Manager-san<br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
My name is Yusala Touya, an elf who was born in Bornean forest.<br/>
<br/>
"Manager, the preparation is complete."<br/>
<br/>
The one who calls me is the sole employee of my shop, the small Nadi. Although she wasn't even as tall as my knee when I first met her, she's grown taller than me before I knew it.<br/>
Human grows fast.<br/>
<br/>
"Let's go."<br/>
<br/>
She answers me with an energetic, "Yes!", and carries the big rucksack below her feet on her shoulder.<br/>
She presents another medium-sized rucksack below her to me while smiling.<br/>
That's my share of luggage huh.<br/>
<br/>
"Laborer."<br/>
"We can't. We don't have extra money for that."<br/>
<br/>
I tried to tell her that I wanted to hire a laborer to carry the luggage, but it was rejected. Since she's in charge of the shop's accounting, I can't push it too much.<br/>
<br/>
It can't be helped, I put my favorite staff in the rucksack, and shoulder it.<br/>
<br/>
"I've put manager's favorite dried fig in the bento, so let's do this energetically!"<br/>
<br/>
Hou, it's quite rare for the economical Nadi to look out for others.<br/>
My lips gets slightly loose. Since the sharp-sighted Nadi grins when she quickly sees it, I tighten it hard.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
◇<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
"Let's enter the mountain from around this area."<br/>
<br/>
Nadi says so while showing the map to me.<br/>
We tie the horses that we rode here on trees. Just in case, I sprinkle medicines to ward monsters around them.<br/>
<br/>
We're in the middle of a job from a merchant boy called Satou to deliver an item for the ashgrey ratkin people who live on an undeveloped land deep in the mountain.<br/>
Normally, I wouldn't take such annoying job, but since he's taking care a girl from my race, I couldn't decline it.<br/>
Rather than saying I cannot decline, normally I should've taken this job free of charge.<br/>
But a good-hearted person he is, he requested the job formally. Moreover, he gave three gold coins<br/>
as the payment. I wanted to tell that I didn't need the money, but Nadi quickly blocked my mouth and I was stopped.<br/>
<br/>
"Manager?"<br/>
"Sorry."<br/>
<br/>
I lost in thought for a bit.<br/>
<br/>
"Then, please."<br/>
"Umu."<br/>
<br/>
I use the secret art for walking in the forest.<br/>
<br/>
"■■■　■■■　■■■■■■■ Wood Walk"<br/>
<br/>
Green aura wraps Nadi and me.<br/>
It's been awhile since I use this magic.<br/>
<br/>
While we're advancing through the forest in these states, branches and weeds as tall as grown man avert themselves from us.<br/>
<br/>
"This magic is really amazing, no matter how many time I see it."<br/>
"Is that so."<br/>
<br/>
I feel slightly embarrassed from Nadi's straight praise.<br/>
As a nihilistic grown man, I have to remain expressionless.<br/>
I guide Nadi while we continue advancing the mountain path. Since obstacles are avoiding themselves from us, it's no different than walking in a highway.<br/>
<br/>
"Ah, that's the firefly lily of the valley flower!"<br/>
"We can't."<br/>
<br/>
Yes, while we're using this magic, we cannot hurt creatures of the forest. Once we do, the magic won't be usable for a season.<br/>
<br/>
"So it's like that, aah, even though we could get five gold coins from the alchemy shop with that flower."<br/>
<br/>
I lead Nadi who keeps staring at the flower in regret by hand, and advance ahead.<br/>
I wonder if there was a big monster that passed here, I catch sights of rocks and trees that are gouged unnaturally. Did some kind of high level monster have settled down in this forest?<br/>
<br/>
I was going to use magic to check it, but then I noticed that my hand was still joined with Nadi's. I want to separate our hands, but she doesn't let it go.<br/>
<br/>
"Nadi?"<br/>
"Err, there, it's separated."<br/>
<br/>
It's rare for the intelligent her. She's really interested with the flower before is she.<br/>
I'm worried with her condition, but I have to confirm the safety first.<br/>
<br/>
"■■■　■■■　■■■■■　■■ Forest Whisper <<Natural Whisper>>"<br/>
<br/>
The magic spreads through the forest.<br/>
<br/>
『Did some new monster spring up in the forest?』<br/>
『Yes, a lot.』<br/>
『They're no more.』<br/>
『No more.』<br/>
『Hero.』<br/>
『Was here.』<br/>
『Night.』<br/>
『Running.』<br/>
『Flying.』<br/>
『Exterminated the great wild boar.』<br/>
<br/>
The forest little echoes continue to echo.<br/>
A hero in such remote forest? There should be some rumor if it was the Saga empire hero, but maybe a hero appeared among the ashgrey ratkin?<br/>
I'm slightly interested with it, but since it doesn't seem to be a monster, there's probably no danger.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
◇<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
We finally arrive at the ratkin settlements in the noon, but unfortunately, looks like we're not really welcomed.<br/>
<br/>
The problem is I don't understand their words. Since I'm told that they saved Mia, I thought that they can speak elf language, but my expectation is off.<br/>
<br/>
"How about it?"<br/>
"Yes, it's similar to weaselkin language. There are also some that are similar with elf language."<br/>
<br/>
Nadi is speaking in guess while grabbing the cuff of my clothes.<br/>
Although I've heard that she's good with language, to be able to interact using unfamiliar language like this, she's truly capable.<br/>
<br/>
I'd like to use the nature magic [Translate] that my granduncle used but I don't have it, it's impossible with my level.<br/>
<br/>
I watch over Nadi who's negotiating.<br/>
In the worst case, we might have to push them the memento at least and go back.<br/>
<br/>
The surrounding ratkin people become slightly noisier. Did Nadi make wrong expressions?<br/>
Un?　My feet is being shaken.<br/>
When I look down, the ratkin little children are coiling around the luggage that Nadi and me have put on the ground. Since their noses are twitching, are they smelling something good?<br/>
<br/>
I slowly squat down while being careful as to not stimulate the surrounding and open the big rucksack.<br/>
Strong smell spread. This bundle have croquettes huh.<br/>
Apparently, the children are interested with this smell. I don't know what's so good with this oily thing, but it's also popular in the city.<br/>
Nadi probably has brought it for her lunch, but let's use these to build friendship with them.<br/>
There are 10 croquettes in the bundle. There are 18 children huh.<br/>
I break the croquettes in half, and share it with the children.<br/>
<br/>
When that happen, several ratkins who look like the mothers appear from the gap between the soldiers, and each of them carries 3-4 children who keep on chewing the croquettes to behind the men.<br/>
I give the last one to the ratkin who look here so wistfully. I saw a slightly appealing glance from Nadi. I'll divide you the dried fig later, so don't get mad.<br/>
<br/>
I don't know if the croquettes succeed as the go-between, but since a ratkin that seem to be the patriarch who understand Shiga kingdom language comes, the goal is complete somehow.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
◇<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
"I see, so my brother has died."<br/>
"According to the person who was present on his last moment, it was a heroic death."<br/>
<br/>
The patriarch says so as he holds the red helmet from among the memento I've handed. I can feel deep sorrow dwelling on his words.<br/>
When I was about to say thanks for saving Mia, and farewell, Nadi cuts in.<br/>
<br/>
"Patriarch-san, why is only the forest around here dying?"<br/>
"I don't know the reason, but they've begun to wither since half a year ago."<br/>
<br/>
I see, I understand what Nadi is trying to say. It's not enough with just thank you words.<br/>
I go out of the patriarch's straw-thatched roof tree house, and use a magic.<br/>
<br/>
"■■　■……■　■　■　■■■■■ Summon Forest Maiden (Summon Dryad)"<br/>
<br/>
In accordance to my spell, the spirit of this mountain forest responds.<br/>
It looks like a little girl with green hair.<br/>
<br/>
"I have something to ask."<br/>
"Elf! It's been awhile."<br/>
"Mountain forest."<br/>
"Do you want to know why the mountain dies?"<br/>
"That's right."<br/>
"The reason why the mountain die is~ because a human tried to forcibly operate the ruin."<br/>
<br/>
According to the Dryad's story, it looks like it's because granduncle Touya's ruin has absorbed the earth veins around here. How can that be.<br/>
<br/>
"Measures."<br/>
"It's alright. The ruin has stopped anyway, and I've taken a lot of mana from a cute child."<br/>
<br/>
Due to the stimulation of that mana, it looks like she's succeeded in drawing power from far away earth veins.<br/>
Even though she looks like that, she's lived for a lot longer than me.<br/>
<br/>
"Thank you very much."<br/>
"It's fine~, see ya."<br/>
<br/>
The dryad went to the other side of the summoning circle while saying that.<br/>
It's already been resolved.<br/>
<br/>
Since I talked with the dryad in elf language, I tell the content of the conversation to the patriarch and Nadi.<br/>
I wonder if my story is difficult, Nadi somehow interprets it for the patriarch.<br/>
<br/>
"Oooh, the village is saved."<br/>
"I'm glad for you patriarch-san."<br/>
"Yes, we won't have to move to a different mountain now."<br/>
<br/>
The patriarch firmly grabs my hand, and says thanks many times over.<br/>
Even though I did nothing.<br/>
<br/>
"Isn't it because you use magic to identify the cause, and report that it's fine already right."<br/>
"Is that so."<br/>
<br/>
Now then, the job is over.<br/>
I want to go back to the city, and take a nap on the usual sofa.<br/>
<br/>
