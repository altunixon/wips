<br/>
The ogre covering his eye in pain has a body big enough that I need to look up.<br/>
His arms are as thick as tree trunks, and hair that looks like wires are growing from him.<br/>
Ain’t this way too big?<br/>
How am I gonna fight against something like this?<br/>
Also, I have practically no mana left…<br/>
I can’t generate water anymore.<br/>
"Oi! Run away already!" (Makoto)<br/>
I speak to the female mage once again.<br/>
"Y-Yes." <br/>
The girl runs away as if crawling.<br/>
Good good.<br/>
At that time, the ogre had taken out the ice blade stabbed in his eye.<br/>
The wound in his eye was visibly regenerating.<br/>
"Oi oi, you serious?" (Makoto)<br/>
I knew ogres had the ability to regenerate, but to think it was to this extent.<br/>
I feel like he would recover immediately even if I were to cut it with my dagger.<br/>
"Ooi, over here." (Makoto)<br/>
I don’t know if he understands me, but I try calling to it to get its attention.<br/>
The ogre glares over here.<br/>
It immediately raised its leg to stomp me.<br/>
Crap.<br/>
[Evade]!<br/>
I activate the thief skill and avoid the attack of the giant.<br/>
*Tung! Tung! Tung! Tung!*<br/>
He repeatedly tries to step on me.<br/>
I continue to avoid it. <br/>
Hiih! If I get crushed by that, it would end me instantly!<br/>
The stepping attacks of the ogre continue on for a while.<br/>
But it wasn’t hitting no matter how much time passed.<br/>
Skills are awesome.<br/>
The female mage has run far away by now. <br/>
Alright, next.<br/>
[Escape]! <br/>
Activating my skill, I get away from the ogre.<br/>
Its face turns bright red and it chases after me.<br/>
Ooh, scary scary.<br/>
A giant monster going straight towards me really is a powerful sight.<br/>
It is a saving that [Clear Mind] is keeping my legs from staggering in fear.<br/>
If it catches up to me, it will be my end though.<br/>
I cannot match it in speed at a straight line, so I move between the trees as if sewing them.<br/>
After running for a while, I arrive at my destination.<br/>
I can see a swamp.<br/>
I found this with my [Mapping] skill.<br/>
I am glad it was close by.<br/>
[Water Magic: Surface Walk.] <br/>
Before entering the swamp, I casted the magic on me and the ogre.<br/>
"Oi, I am here~." (Makoto)<br/>
This is the decisive point.<br/>
Will it go well?<br/>
What should I do if it doesn’t?<br/>
The ogre rushed towards me.<br/>
Nice, come.<br/>
The ogre is rushing towards me without noticing that he is walking on top of the swamp.<br/>
I succeeded in pulling him around the middle of the swamp.<br/>
[Surface Walk: Release]!<br/>
I undo the support spell casted on the ogre.<br/>
The ogre gets swallowed by the swamp while raising a big splash.<br/>
Of course, the ogre immediately struggled to get onto the surface again.<br/>
"As if I would let you!" (Makoto)<br/>
[Water Magic: Water Current]<br/>
I use a spell to control the current of water, and create swirls in the swamp.<br/>
With this, it shouldn’t be able to swim properly.<br/>
On top of that, I entangle its legs with the water and mud at the bottom of the swamp, and slowly drag the ogre down to the bottom.<br/>
"Gaaaaaaaaaaah!"<br/>
A cry of pain was raised as the ogre sunk.<br/>
Around 10 minutes later.<br/>
I confirm that the ogre had drowned in the swamp.<br/>
It struggled desperately at the bottom of the swamp without breathing for a whole 10 minutes.<br/>
"I am glad it went well…" (Makoto)<br/>
Cold sweat was coming out after everything was done.<br/>
"Oi! Makoto, are you okay?" (Jean)<br/>
Jean came together with his party.<br/>
Looks like everyone is okay.<br/>
"I defeated it just now." (Makoto)<br/>
Saying this, I make the ogre float up.<br/>
"Y-You…you defeated that giant ogre?!" (Jean)<br/>
"W-Wow." (Emily)<br/>
Jean and the priest girl raised voices of shock.<br/>
"T-Thank you." <br/>
The female mage gives me her thanks.<br/>
"Aah, for now, let’s just bring back the head of the ogre." (Jean)<br/>
Jean swiftly severs the head of the ogre that I killed.<br/>
After that, we returned to the guild while avoiding the monsters.<br/>
Haah, that was tiring.<br/>
I am sleeping early today.<br/>
◇◇<br/>
 "You guys, look at this ogre! A big catch that’s several times bigger in size than the average! Who do you think was the one who defeated it?!" <br/>
At the Adventurer Guild’s hunt handing space, Lucas-san was shouting while raising a glass of ale in one hand.<br/>
He was pretty drunk.<br/>
It seems like the ogre that we fought today wasn’t a regular monster, but a big ogre, which is a rare breed.<br/>
Lucas-san yelled at me saying that facing a big ogre alone was suicidal.<br/>
But it looks like he has forgotten about it.<br/>
"Who defeated it?" (Mary)<br/>
That was Mary-san just now.<br/>
"The rising rookie, Makoto! I am not gonna let you guys call him Goblin Cleaner anymore! He is the Ogre Killer!!" (Lucas)<br/>
""""Ooooh!!"""""<br/>
Cheers were raised.<br/>
This is the 3rd time this exchange has happened.<br/>
Ogre Killer is also an embarrassing nickname, so please spare me.<br/>
I was eating my skewers and watching the ruckus from afar at the usual stall.<br/>
"You are the hero today." <br/>
Boss smiles at me.<br/>
"I am tired. I want to go to sleep already." (Makoto)<br/>
I want to sleep quickly, but the place I sleep in is the rest area of the guild.<br/>
With this much of a ruckus, I wouldn’t be able to sleep even if I wanted to.<br/>
"Well, isn’t it fine? Want something to drink?" <br/>
"I have been made to drink alcohol a lot today, so give me water please." (Makoto)<br/>
"Here ya go." <br/>
A glass of water comes out.<br/>
Lukewarm.<br/>
[Water Magic: Cooling]<br/>
I cool the water and drink it sparingly to keep down the alcohol.<br/>
"Hey, is this seat open?" <br/>
Someone spoke to me suddenly.<br/>
The female mage I saved not that long ago.<br/>
"If you wish to." (Makoto)<br/>
The female mage sits next to me.<br/>
Red hair and red slanted eyes, and gives out the impression of having a strong character. She is also an outstanding beauty.<br/>
And now that I look carefully, she has pointed ears.<br/>
Elf?<br/>
This girl was an elf, huh.<br/>
This is the first one I have met since coming to this world.<br/>
A classic of fantasies.<br/>
My spirit rises silently.<br/>
But the eyes and hair of this girl are red. <br/>
According to the book I read at the temple, the elves in this world have blonde or silver hair, and the color of their eyes are blue or green.<br/>
That’s why she might be a different race.<br/>
I should stealthily ask Mary-san later<br/>
"Old man, any cocktails here?" <br/>
"Here ya go." <br/>
He brought out one with a ratio of soda.<br/>
"Thanks for today." <br/>
"You’re welcome." (Makoto)<br/>
We clink our glasses together.<br/>
"My name is Lucy. You are my life savior, Makoto." (Lucy)<br/>
"You don’t need to mind it. I got the reward from the guild, and I also got CP from the Gods." (Makoto)<br/>
My lifespan increased by around 1 week.<br/>
But I felt like I lost 1 week of my lifespan with that experience. <br/>
I am fine not gonna be fighting an ogre for quite a while.<br/>
"But that was amazing. You are a bronze rank mage apprentice, right? To be able to defeat that big ogre alone." (Lucy)<br/>
"I was lucky." (Makoto)<br/>
"Compared to me, even though I can use High Grade magic, I wasn’t useful at all…" (Lucy)<br/>
So she can use High Grade magic.<br/>
Real jealous of that.<br/>
A shame I couldn’t see her magic today though.<br/>
"That’s impressive. I would love to exchange your skill with mine." (Makoto)<br/>
"That’s not it! My skills are strong, but I can’t use them properly at all. How can I activate magic as fast as you? That was chantless, right?" (Lucy)<br/>
Not only is the firepower low, but my casting amount is low too after all.<br/>
If I don’t do it chantless, it wouldn’t even be worth using.<br/>
"If you reach proficiency level 50 or more, you can cast chantless." (Makoto)<br/>
"I know, but raising it all the way up there is incredibly difficult…" (Lucy)<br/>
"I began learning magic from zero for 1 year and 3 months, you know?" (Makoto)<br/>
"Huh? You are lying." (Lucy)<br/>
"No, as I have said before, I came from a parallel world." (Makoto)<br/>
"An otherworldler… A comrade of the heroes that came 1 year ago, then." (Lucy)<br/>
"No, I am not really a comrade of the heroes… They are indeed my classmates though." (Makoto)<br/>
My classmates who obtained powerful skills had become famous in the 1 year they have been here.<br/>
Many are in important posts of the many countries.<br/>
They somewhat broke the power balance of this world.<br/>
That’s got nothing to do with me though.<br/>
"Otherworldlers really are amazing!" (Lucy)<br/>
Lucy’s eyes sparkle.<br/>
Aah, she must be misunderstanding something here.<br/>
My stats are hella low, you know?<br/>
"U-Uhm…" (Lucy)<br/>
Lucy puts down the glass she had and holds my hand.<br/>
Getting closer to me, she whispers.<br/>
"Can you form a party with me?" (Lucy)<br/>
Your face is close.<br/>
Right now I am not using [Clear Mind] and [RPG Player].<br/>
When I am drunk, it gets troubling to use skills.<br/>
As a result, I ended up looking at Lucy’s face from point-blank distance.<br/>
I am getting flustered by that attractive face of hers.<br/>
C-Calm down, calm down.<br/>
Activate [Clear Mind].<br/>
But the always reliable [Clear Mind] isn’t activating properly because of how drunk I am.<br/>
Crap, I drank too much.<br/>
No good! Ah, I can feel her breath…<br/>
"Wait, what do you mean by that?!" <br/>
The voice of someone returned me to my senses.<br/>
The priest girl that’s in Jean’s party.<br/>
There’s also Jean beside her.<br/>
"What, Emily?" (Lucy)<br/>
"Don’t ‘what’ me! It hasn’t even been long since you joined our party!" (Emily)<br/>
"And what about it? I have no business with the party that abandoned me and ran away." (Lucy)<br/>
Woah, Lucy-san.<br/>
It seems she is holding a grudge for that time with the ogre.<br/>
But Jean desperately told you to run away, you know? <br/>
"Hey, Lucy, I am sorry for what I did. I just couldn’t save the both of you together." (Jean)<br/>
"That’s because you two are a thing, right? I don’t need an unreliable leader." (Lucy)<br/>
Lucy outright rejects the apology of Jean.<br/>
"You, who do you think you are?!" (Emily)<br/>
Emily went at Lucy as if she was going to jump her at any moment.<br/>
"Shut up, you bitch. You got uneasy since the time I joined the party, so you seduced Jean and slept with him, right? You two do disappear every night together." (Lucy)<br/>
"Don’t say such nonsense!" (Emily)<br/>
Ooh…<br/>
This is way too intense of a talk for me.<br/>
Jean was looking at the two flustered.<br/>
Stop them, Leader.<br/>
"Ooi, what is all this racket?" <br/>
"What, a fight?" <br/>
Lucas-san came.<br/>
Mary-san, too.<br/>
"A fight between drunkards." (Makoto)<br/>
"Okay okay, Emily and Lucy, make some distance." (Mary)<br/>
Mary-san seems to be used to this kind of happenings in the guild, she quickly moved in between them.<br/>
"Jean, didn’t you have something to say to Makoto?" (Lucas)<br/>
Hm? Really? <br/>
When I looked at Jean, he fidgeted without meeting my gaze.<br/>
What is it?<br/>
Confessing your love? <br/>
"I-I am sorry! Thank you for saving me, Makoto!" (Jean)<br/>
He lowered his head deeply.<br/>
"Aah, it is okay." (Makoto)<br/>
I don’t really mind it.<br/>
Honestly speaking, I don’t really feel like I saved Jean.<br/>
I think he could have escaped just fine alone.<br/>
"What a good guy…" (Jean)<br/>
Don’t look at me with those moved eyes, it troubles me.<br/>
"Makoto-san! I thank you too. Please forgive what Jean said." (Emily)<br/>
Even the priest Emily-san apologized.<br/>
Hmm, it is a bit embarrassing.<br/>
"Makoto, insult them! These useless bunch!" (Lucy)<br/>
"You shut up, Lucy!" (Emily)<br/>
Right.<br/>
Lucy-san, the boomerang is stabbed in your head, you know?<br/>
"Makoto, about the matter with Jean, are you fine with this?" (Lucy)<br/>
"Rather than being fine or not, I didn’t even mind it in the first place." (Makoto)<br/>
"Well, if you don’t, then that’s okay. Get along as newcomers from now on, please", is what Lucas-san says to wrap this up.<br/>
"With this, the matter with Jean is okay now. By the way, Lucy." (Lucas)<br/>
Lucas-san faces the direction of Lucy.<br/>
"W-What?" (Lucy)<br/>
"Are you going to form a party with Makoto?" (Lucas)<br/>
"T-That’s right!" (Lucy)<br/>
She answers with her chest puffed out.<br/>
Eh? Did I accept?<br/>
[RPG Player] shows me the options.<br/>
[Will you accept Lucy into your party?] <br/>
Yes<br/>
No ←<br/>
Hmm, this is sudden… <br/>
‘Lucy-san is a beauty, but wouldn’t she get disillusioned once she sees my skills and stats?’ Is the kind of negative thought that surfaced in my head.<br/>
Would not accepting her be the rational choice here?<br/>
"Makoto, are you forming a party?" Lucas-san asks.<br/>
"I was thinking about continuing solo." (Makoto)<br/>
"Eh?! N-No way…" (Lucy)<br/>
Lucy screams.<br/>
"Haha! Rejected~." (Emily)<br/>
Emily makes a nice smile as she pokes fun at Lucy.<br/>
Hey, Emily-san…can you please not?<br/>
"W-Why?! Am I no good?" (Lucy)<br/>
I don’t know about you that much to even be able to point out a why.<br/>
But it seems like Lucas-san is the ally of Lucy here.<br/>
"Makoto, I think it is gonna be rough to continue as a solo mage apprentice from here on, you know." (Lucas)<br/>
"I will be taking it slow. I am fine staying as a Bronze Rank for a while." (Makoto)<br/>
"No, the ogre you defeated today isn’t something a Bronze can defeat…" (Lucas)<br/>
"Also, I am a mage apprentice with low stats. You will definitely be disappointed, Lucy." (Makoto)<br/>
Saying this, I take out my Soul Book and show it to her.<br/>
"Eh?! What’s with these stats?!" (Lucy)<br/>
"M-Makoto, you were working as an adventurer with stats like this…? You can’t even swing a sword with this…" (Jean)<br/>
"Eh…? Mana: 3? A commoner?" (Emily)<br/>
Shut up, you guys.<br/>
Or more like, Jean and Emily, I didn’t say you guys could look. <br/>
"See? Awful stats, right? And yet, Makoto-kun is doing his best." (Mary)<br/>
Mary-san pats my head.<br/>
It sounds like you are consoling me, but you are also ridiculing me there, you know.<br/>
"No Strength, no Endurance, no Mana; only his magic proficiency is abnormally high", is what Lucas-san said while drinking his beer.<br/>
"Eeeh?! Magic proficiency: 90?! H-He is crazy…" (Lucy)<br/>
Lucy is looking at me as if I am some sort of lunatic.<br/>
How rude.<br/>
"I have little mana to use, so I have no choice but to come up with ways to use it effectively." (Makoto)<br/>
I have been pouring my soul into training my proficiency in this 1 year after all.<br/>
"That’s why you had to lure the ogre all the way to a water source, huh." (Jean)<br/>
Jean says this as if impressed.<br/>
"That’s how it is, Lucy-san. Go find someone else." (Makoto)<br/>
"W-Wait! I don’t mind it!" (Lucy)<br/>
Oh? Even though I showed her my stats, she is not backing down?<br/>
"Rethink it please, Makoto. My [Fire Magic: Monarch Grade] will definitely be of use", is what Lucy continues with.<br/>
"Monarch Grade? That’s impressive." (Makoto)<br/>
I don’t think there were that many among my classmates who had that grade.<br/>
Must be quite the rare skill.<br/>
"Hmm…" (Makoto)<br/>
I ponder.<br/>
Honestly speaking, since the time I was training at the Water Temple, I had given up on having a party.<br/>
I have been looked down on a plenty lot after all.<br/>
I was prepared to go solo for the rest of my life.<br/>
"Aren’t there a whole lot of parties that would want you to join them?" (Makoto)<br/>
A Monarch Skill mage.<br/>
I feel like there’s many who would desire to have someone like that. <br/>
Lucy averts her gaze.<br/>
"N-No, you see, when you are as wanted as me, you get to decide who you want to join a party with." (Lucy)<br/>
"What are you saying? Aren’t you famous for being a troublemaker that gets kicked out of every party in less than a month?" (Emily)<br/>
Emily throws in a remark from the side.<br/>
"You have been really noisy for a while now!" (Lucy)<br/>
"It is the truth though!" (Emily)<br/>
Lucy and Emily were going ‘hiisssss!’ Like a cat trying to intimidate.<br/>
"Okaay, you two, let’s drink over here, okay?" (Mary)<br/>
Mary-san moved Jean and Emily elsewhere.<br/>
Thanks, Mary-san.<br/>
"This girl, even though her skills are strong, she still cannot use them well." (Lucas)<br/>
Lucas-san adds.<br/>
"She can’t seem to settle in any party, but I feel like if it is with you Makoto, it will be okay." (Lucas)<br/>
Eeh, will it really be?<br/>
The mage apprentice with the lowest stats, and the mage that cannot use her skills properly.<br/>
Isn’t the balance bad?<br/>
"I am a mage apprentice though?" (Makoto)<br/>
"It is okay! Let’s train together!" (Lucy)<br/>
Lucy says powerfully.<br/>
Train together as mages, huh. <br/>
That does sound nice.<br/>
In the Water Temple, my surroundings were all elementary school children so it didn’t really feel like I was training with comrades.<br/>
The option appears again.<br/>
[Will you accept Lucy into your party?]<br/>
Yes<br/>
No ←<br/>
Eh? <br/>
Didn’t I choose No just a few moments ago?<br/>
Are these choices just to set the mood? <br/>
H-How useless.<br/>
"Isn’t it okay? Try forming a party and see how it goes." (Lucas)<br/>
"Right right. You should mingle more with other adventurers, you know." (Mary)<br/>
Mary-san had returned and advised me.<br/>
"Makoto, having comrades is important, you know?" <br/>
Even Boss chimed in.<br/>
This is an atmosphere where I can’t refuse.<br/>
Aah, this must be that.<br/>
It happens a lot in games too. <br/>
A forced event.<br/>
I look at Lucy once again.<br/>
A female mage with a strong personality and big slanted eyes.<br/>
Even when taking a quick look around the guild, she would still land as a top class beauty.<br/>
Owner of the strong Fire Magic: Monarch.<br/>
It is such a waste on me.<br/>
I feel like I might get punished with all this luxury.<br/>
[RPG Player] once again prompts me.<br/>
[Will you accept Lucy into your party?]<br/>
Yes<br/>
No ←<br/>
(Haah, I get it already. ) (Makoto)<br/>
I offer my right hand to Lucy.<br/>
"Looking forward to working with you." (Makoto)<br/>
"Same here!" (Lucy)<br/>
Lucy grabs my hand with strength and shows a wide smile.<br/>
And in this way, I obtained my first comrade since coming to this world.<br/>
