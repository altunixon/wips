Chapter 164: Negligence<br/>
The first one to react to my words was Ren.<br/>
"Keep your hands off of Mein!" (Ren)<br/>
Ren brandishes his sword.<br/>
It lets out sparks as it collides with my arm.<br/>
Of course, I don’t take any damage. It’s not like he learned the other reinforcement methods in this short amount of time.<br/>
At this level, I don’t even need to use my shield.<br/>
"You know. If you call her that, her punishment will only increase." (Naofumi)<br/>
"Shut it. Get away from Mein!" (Ren)<br/>
Witch is also struggling. It’s become difficult to hold her with one hand.<br/>
「Meteor Sword!」 (Ren)<br/>
Oh, a skill might be able to inflict some damage on me. I’m holding a relatively rare egg right now.<br/>
It will be a waste if it breaks, so I back off.<br/>
In exchange, Rafatalia and Firo step forward.<br/>
Even Motoyasu takes up a fighting stance.<br/>
We’re all prepared to capture Ren, Bitch and Woman 2.<br/>
"Ren, it’s better if you don’t trust that witch. She’s exactly as the Queen described." (Naofumi)<br/>
She can put false crimes on people without remorse, and she loves watching others struggle.<br/>
Ren will probably be tricked and discarded sometime soon as well.<br/>
Just like Motoyasu.<br/>
"Look closely at Motoyasu’s face. Doesn’t he look pitiable? Is this the face of a person who would do such things?" (Naofumi)<br/>
"No, I heard Motoyasu was also coerced by the Queen! The Queen is the ringleader behind all of this." (Ren)<br/>
"And isn’t that single woman the only one telling you that?" (Naofumi)<br/>
"Even so, I must fight for the people who believe in me!" (Ren)<br/>
"Calm down. Think Logically. The normal you would have figured it out by now." (Naofumi)<br/>
"Shut up!" (Ren)<br/>
Ah… this is impossible. He seriously believes he is in the right.<br/>
I can’t really blame him here.<br/>
In my case, I had the slight feeling that something was off, but I never realized I had been deceived until the end.<br/>
And the current Ren is mentally unstable. He sides with Witch, who offered him plenty of soft words.<br/>
… Should I kill her?<br/>
I should have enough power now. Unlike before.<br/>
Wait, a Shadow should be somewhere around here.<br/>
If the Shadow utilizes the slave crest, I won’t have to fight Ren.<br/>
Perhaps I will be able to teach him proper reinforcement techniques and add him to my fighting force.<br/>
… Though earning his trust won’t be that easy.<br/>
As if responding to my thoughts, Bitch’s slave crest begins to glow.<br/>
"Ku…. Ren-sama! We should retreat for now." (Bitch)<br/>
"Understood! 「Flashing Sword!」" (Ren)<br/>
On Witch’s words, Ren unleashes a skill.<br/>
And as before, his sword starts glowing.<br/>
"Damn! Rafatalia, Firo!" (Naofumi)<br/>
"Yes!" (Rafatalia)<br/>
"Yeah!" (Firo)<br/>
Right after I gave my warning, the sword releases a blinding light.<br/>
As if that will work forever!<br/>
"I, who has understood the origin of power commands you. I shall once again read forth the truth. Bind this foul light that clouds us from knowledge!" (Rafatalia)<br/>
「Al Anti-Shining!」 (Rafatalia)<br/>
Our eyes that were under the influence of Ren’s flashing sword start to clear up.<br/>
And Firo jumps into the air in preparation for a kick. But she is too late. Ren picks up Bitch and Woman 2, and brandishes his sword once more.<br/>
「Transfer Sword!」 (Ren)<br/>
Just like when Motoyasu disappeared, Ren’s image starts to fade.<br/>
And so does Witch’s.<br/>
"Witch, it seems you were able to escape this time. But remember this: I’ll chase you to the depths of hell. All you have to do is wait in a corner, cowering in fear." (Naofumi)<br/>
"Hmph!" (Bitch)<br/>
I hear witch snorting at my proclamation before she completely disappears.<br/>
This skill truly is annoying.<br/>
I need to find some way to seal it.<br/>
"Dammit! She got away again! That damn Witch, I’ll definitely slaughter her later!" (Naofumi)<br/>
"Naofumi-sama, please calm down." (Rafatalia)<br/>
"Aren’t you frustrated? Has she begun corrupting you as well!?" (Naofumi)<br/>
I’m madder then I’ve ever been in a long time.<br/>
What should I take my anger out on?<br/>
It’s immature, but I start to get angry at Rafatalia.<br/>
"… Naofumi-sama, your words are enough to keep me by your side." (Rafatalia)<br/>
"I see…" (Naofumi)<br/>
If Rafatalia is okay with this, then I guess I should endure my rage for a little longer.<br/>
But I won’t forget this, Witch.<br/>
This rage greater than I can handle. Someday it will be embedded into your chest with a ten inch rusty nail.<br/>
As I slowly stomach my rage, Shadow appears.<br/>
"…She has escaped out of my range-gojaru. I can only send out fatal punishment, but I cannot track her." (Shadow)<br/>
I don’t think killing her would be that bad, but Shadow also has orders. We can’t kill her without due process…<br/>
And I kinda want her to suffer 100x more. Am I a bad person?<br/>
"So it seems." (Naofumi)<br/>
"I never thought the former princess would be able to seduce the Hero of the Sword so easily-gojaru." (Shadow)<br/>
"Just when I was looking for them, they suddenly appeared. Perhaps my luck is better than I thought." (Naofumi)<br/>
"I see-gojaru… anyways I’m off to give a report to the Queen-gojaru. By the way, what should we do with the Hero of the Spear-gojaru?" (Shadow)<br/>
"…If we try something, won’t he just run away?" (Naofumi)<br/>
If he has such a convenient skill, I don’t think we can apprehend him.<br/>
I can’t even begin to think of how convenient it would have been for me if I had it when I was on the lam.<br/>
"I don’t think it seems that way-gojaru." (Shadow)<br/>
Motoyasu has dropped his stance and is staring at the ground sighing.<br/>
So his heart has already given up.<br/>
"What’s up? Won’t you run?" (Naofumi)<br/>
"It’s fine… I wanted to find everyone. I believed in them, but this is all I get… The townsfolk all treat me coldly… I’m tired…" (Motoyasu)<br/>
His eyes look cloudy. If he were a magical girl, this is where he would turn into a witch.<br/>
(TL: Madoka reference… Yes, I watched it. Didn’t enjoy it)<br/>
"So will you take him in?" (Naofumi)<br/>
"I don’t think he will be punished that badly-gojaru. The world still needs him to fight in the wave-gojaru." (Shadow)<br/>
"Yeah, that’s true… We can’t really give him overly cruel penalties, and we can’t kill him…" (Naofumi)<br/>
If killing was all we had to do, then Rafatalia and Firo would be able to do it in one blow.<br/>
But then we wouldn’t have to capture him.<br/>
"For now, Motoyasu, you’re under arrest." (Naofumi)<br/>
"… Yes, yes I understand. Take me wherever you will. Kill me if you want…" (Motoyasu)<br/>
Motoyasu seems to have given up all hope<br/>
But after what just happened it can’t be helped.<br/>
"Everyone asks me to save them, and if I make the slightest mistake they throw stones at me… The Bitch and Elena that I believed with all of my heart turned out to be bad people… I don’t even care anymore…" (Motoyasu)<br/>
He had believed in his comrades, and had thus tried to search the globe for them, but those very comrades abandoned him.<br/>
There must be a reason it turned out like this. I’m not at fault. He must be thinking things like that.<br/>
And the sun is already setting.<br/>
"Should I take him to the castle now?" (Naofumi)<br/>
"It seems to be an urgent matter, so I’ll leave it to you, Iwatani-dono-gojaru." (Shadow)<br/>
"Got it. Oy, Motoyasu." (Naofumi)<br/>
"It’s fine. Just say I caused this disaster already… Will that satisfy you?" (Motoyasu)<br/>
What the hell are you giving in to. You’re definitely a cause of this disaster.<br/>
Why are you acting like it’s someone else’s problem?<br/>
"… Can you use that Warp skill to go to the castle?" (Naofumi)<br/>
"That’s not its current registered destination, so it’s impossible." (Motoyasu)<br/>
"So it’s no use here. What material did you absorb to get that spear?" (Naofumi)<br/>
Learning that skill will make transportation convenient.<br/>
It can be used for peddling, level grinding and many more.<br/>
I should probably have the ability to learn it.<br/>
"… It’s the Dragon Hourglass’s sand." (Motoyasu)<br/>
"When were you able to take it-gojaru!?" (Shadow)<br/>
So that’s what it is. Isn’t that kinda illegal?<br/>
Ren and Itsuki probably already absorbed some as well.<br/>
Why didn’t I try it yet?<br/>
"I didn’t steal anything. The sisters gave it to me when I asked." (Motoyasu)<br/>
Shadow glares at him.<br/>
"N-now that I think about it, there were some reports of that happening when the Three Hero church was in control… gojaru." (Shadow)<br/>
"Say that ahead of time!" (Naofumi)<br/>
Now that I think about it, there are a mountain of materials I have yet to try. I haven’t been feeding the shield much lately.<br/>
The Yggdrasil medicine was too valuable so I didn’t feed it to the Shield.<br/>
I should start testing more things.<br/>
"What sort of skill is it?" (Naofumi)<br/>
"It lets you teleport to a preset location…" (Motoyasu)<br/>
"Are there any conditions?" (Naofumi)<br/>
"No idea… In my game you could use it in any area that didn’t prevent skills." (Motoyasu)<br/>
I still have no idea how to prevent it.<br/>
Though there may have been areas that limited it while in the game, I have no idea if this world has such places.<br/>
Can you set to anywhere you’ve been before?<br/>
"What can you set the destination as?" (Naofumi)<br/>
"You can set up to Three locations. If you try to set another, the oldest one will be forgotten. The most people you can take with you is 6." (Motoyasu.)<br/>
He’s being strangely compliant… Anyways, the castle is quite a distance away. If we can’t warp there directly, I guess we’ll have to stay the night in this town.<br/>
"Then we’ll find a place to stay the night here." (Naofumi)<br/>
"Understood." (Motoyasu)<br/>
"Understood-gojaru. I will depart to relay the situation to the Queen-gojaru." (Shadow)<br/>
"How do you contact the Queen anyways?" (Naofumi)<br/>
"Secret-gojaru. I’ll only tell you that I can’t carry anyone with me-gojaru." (Shadow)<br/>
Shadow disappears as she says this.<br/>
Her response somehow annoys me.<br/>
Firo begins poking the depressed Motoyasu.<br/>
Even after he saw what that women did to me, he’s still this depressed?<br/>
Perhaps he is finally feeling the fatigue of the lifestyle he has been living until now.<br/>
I don’t really care, and I kinda like seeing his depressed face, but I notice Rafatalia glaring at me.<br/>
"Naofumi-sama? What’s wrong? (Rafatalia)<br/>
"Nothing really. Let’s go find an inn." (Naofumi)<br/>
"Yes." (Rafatalia)<br/>
And that’s how we dragged Motoyasu with us, and found an Inn to stay at.<br/>
