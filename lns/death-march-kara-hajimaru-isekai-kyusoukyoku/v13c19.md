<br/>
In Arisa's point of view this time.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
13-19. Nanashi and Arisa<br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
"Arisa, you sure look quite cheerful today."<br/>
"You think so?"<br/>
<br/>
Dehehe, I understand myself that my face has broken into a smile.<br/>
I don't think something wonderful like Yotogi will happen probably, but getting called out by your loved one in the middle of the night sure fires you up.<br/>
<br/>
If I don't stop myself from getting another three helping in the feast today, were I strip and show my bulging stomach, my maiden's heart will be in a pinch.<br/>
Ah but, the dishes in the royal castle are different than what Lulu and Master usually make, so I just can't stop~<br/>
<br/>
--ＰＹＷＥＥＥＥ！<br/>
<br/>
I heard a high-pitched voice when the carriage was just about to arrive at the royal castle's parking lot.<br/>
<br/>
"Chicken meat~?"<br/>
"Bird of prey nanodesu."<br/>
<br/>
Bird of prey? Is it like a hawk or an eagle?<br/>
<br/>
"--Coachman! Stop the carriage!"<br/>
<br/>
Liza who's looking outside speaks loudly.<br/>
<br/>
I wonder what is it?<br/>
<br/>
Time for magic!<br/>
<br/>
[Area Search] activate!<br/>
<br/>
Above is--.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
◇<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
"Arisa, pull yourself together."<br/>
<br/>
Liza is slapping my cheeks.<br/>
In the grove of trees--the carriage is overturned on the thicket.<br/>
<br/>
Apparently, I fainted.<br/>
<br/>
"W-what happened?"<br/>
"The horses acted violently and overturned the carriage."<br/>
<br/>
The horses did--?<br/>
<br/>
"--Right! I remember now!"<br/>
<br/>
Right when I was shouting, I heard the call from Tama and Pochi.<br/>
It seems they've gone scouting.<br/>
<br/>
"Lots of carriages fell~"<br/>
"It'll be bad if we don't save them quick nanodesu."<br/>
<br/>
That thing flies over the grove of trees like, 'gouu'.<br/>
<br/>
--ＰＹＷＥＥＥＥ！<br/>
<br/>
Beyond the grove, I see many carriages toppled over and something circling in the sky.<br/>
<br/>
Eagle as its upper half of the body, and lion as the lower half.<br/>
<br/>
The mythical beast that rules over the sky--Griffon.<br/>
<br/>
Anyone who sees that figure can only choose to escape.<br/>
<br/>
--ＰＹＷＥＥＥＥ！<br/>
<br/>
However, I'll say this daringly!<br/>
<br/>
"Griffon's cry should be 『Guruu』!!!"<br/>
"Arisa--what are you saying?"<br/>
<br/>
Liza is looking seriously worried about me.<br/>
I'm sorry. I know that it's not a good timing to make the joke, but I couldn't help but did it no matter what.<br/>
<br/>
I wonder if being an otaku is sinful....<br/>
<br/>
"But, how did that monster invade the royal castle?"<br/>
<br/>
I suddenly realized it when I heard Lulu.<br/>
<br/>
Come to think of it, the royal castle has the barrier of Ancient King Yamato, so it was even safe during the attack of a greater demon back then, how did this one enter I wonder?<br/>
<br/>
"Huhuh~?"<br/>
"It's Master nanodesu!"<br/>
<br/>
Eh? Where?<br/>
<br/>
"■■■■　■■ Long Sight. That clothing and violet wig is certainly Master's, so I report."<br/>
<br/>
I also take out a telescope from my magic bag, and look at the back of the circling Griffon.<br/>
<br/>
I see a small figure of a person on its back.<br/>
If that figure is really Master, then the Griffon seems to be around 10 meter long big body in total.<br/>
<br/>
"But, I don't think Master would do something that trouble people you know?"<br/>
"Nn, agree."<br/>
<br/>
Just as Lulu and Mia have said, this is unlike Master.<br/>
<br/>
--Moreover.<br/>
<br/>
"Everyone, get ready for battle!"<br/>
<br/>
Everyone looks surprised hearing my command.<br/>
<br/>
"A-Arisa?"<br/>
"That's an impostor!"<br/>
<br/>
I mean the chest area is swelled.<br/>
Master who hates cross-dressing will never cross-dresses by himself.<br/>
<br/>
"For now, let's attract their attention. I'll confine them in my space magic once they come here!"<br/>
"Understood. Pochi, Tama, use Magic Edge Cannon. Lulu, guard Mia and Arisa. Nana, provide the counterattack."<br/>
<br/>
Everyone starts to act following Liza's instructions.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
◇<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Red balls of light shot by the three fly toward the Griffon.<br/>
However, right before they hit, the shots missed the Griffon as if they evaded it themselves.<br/>
<br/>
"--Wind barrier."<br/>
<br/>
I hear Mia muttering next to me.<br/>
<br/>
However, we should have succeeded tempting it going to the grove.<br/>
I mean the Griffon's hostile line of sight is directed here.<br/>
<br/>
The Griffon plunges toward us at a terrific speed!<br/>
I look up at the Griffon and shout.<br/>
<br/>
"Only barrier can win against barrier!"<br/>
<br/>
That ain't the case, but the mood is important!<br/>
<br/>
The tension MAX me can do it!<br/>
Without unique skill, there's no way this can be resisted!<br/>
<br/>
--Activating space magic's [<<Dimension Labyrinth>>]!<br/>
<br/>
The space before the Griffon swirls, swallowing its big body.<br/>
They tried to evade in a hurry, but their speed became their undoing, they disappeared into the the other dimension created by my magic.<br/>
<br/>
"As expected of Arisa."<br/>
"Not yet! Three minutes. I'm going to call for reinforcement, so everyone please help the injured people in the parking lot!"<br/>
<br/>
After I told so, everyone began to act immediately.<br/>
<br/>
I take out the continuous MP-healing magic potion, that Master's created, from magic bag and drink it.<br/>
I still have enough magic power, but it's to be doubly sure.<br/>
<br/>
Next I activate space magic's [Telephone], calling Master.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
◇<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
『Yes, it's Satou here.』<br/>
"Master, it's an emergency. Come here."<br/>
<br/>
I frankly report. <br/>
<br/>
"What's happened?"<br/>
<br/>
As expected of cheat Master, to come at the next moment, he's too wonderf--mu?<br/>
<br/>
"Wait, don't come with that figure."<br/>
"Ah, sorry--"<br/>
<br/>
Master is not in his usual black haired shota-like figure, but in Echigoya Firm's Kuro figure with a foreign actor's face and white hair.<br/>
It might be handsome and all, but I like his usual face more than the camouflage mask.<br/>
<br/>
After confirming that no one is looking, Master changes back to the usual Satou figure.<br/>
<br/>
"And, what happened?"<br/>
"An impostor of Master and a Griffon appeared."<br/>
"What? Here too?"<br/>
<br/>
Master expressed his surprise.<br/>
<br/>
"Eh? Did a Griffon come out too there?"<br/>
"No, it was a fake Satou in my case."<br/>
<br/>
So, such a wonderful object appeared.<br/>
I want to see it a bit.<br/>
<br/>
"So, where's the impostor and the Griffon?"<br/>
"They're there."<br/>
<br/>
We ran out of time-out before I could explain.<br/>
The sky broke, and a beak appeared.<br/>
<br/>
"Then, I'll go ahead and eliminate--"<br/>
<br/>
After declaring so reliably, Master won't move for some reason.<br/>
<br/>
"--That idiot."<br/>
<br/>
Master who's unusually angry changed into Nanashi form, disappeared, and reappeared beside the Griffon.<br/>
<br/>
They're saying something in the distant, but I can't hear it here.<br/>
<br/>
Next moment, the Griffon disappeared together with Master.<br/>
<br/>
....I wonder what happened?<br/>
<br/>
