      <p>It had been three days since I decided to officially cater meals for the 《Cryptic Venerable Inn》.</p>

      <p>Today was the 22nd of the Blue month.</p>

      <p>After closing shop, I asked Kamyua Yost about the issue of the ownership of the Totos again. I then asked something I had been curious about—「the diet of a traveler」.</p>

      <p>「Well, a traveler’s meals are simple. When they have to spend more than a day on the road between towns, travelers will need to bring ready-to-eat meals with them. I think I told you before, the jerky sold in the Post Station Town is a classic ready-to-eat food.」</p>

      <p>We were staying inside the restaurant of the 《Kimyusu’s Tail Inn》.</p>

      <p>Ludo Wu accompanied as my escort, and Kamyua Yost’s disciple Leito was also standing beside him.</p>

      <p>「The most common and cheapest way is to boil the poitan, dried aria, and jerky together in a pot. People who are more well off will add some rock salt and herbs. You can imagine how that tastes. Even the cheap snacks in the Post Station Town are tastier than this poitan soup.」</p>

      <p>「I see〜, boiling poitan, aria, and jerky, huh. If aria and fresh meat are used instead of dried aria and jerky, that will be just like a kiba pot eaten by the denizens of Forest’s Edge.」</p>

      <p>Ludo who was not used to sitting in chairs and was leaning against the wall interjected suddenly. Kamyua Yost looked at him and showed his usual cheery smile.</p>

      <p>「This must be the knowledge that the forebears of the Forest’s Edge learned from the town. If not, the denizens of Forest’s Edge wouldn’t have known that they can live healthily by eating these vegetables. You only had the chance to buy vegetables from the town after moving into the Morga forest.」</p>

      <p>「I see, that’s why the nutritious aria and poitan became the staple food of Forest’s Edge. After hearing you saying that, I finally understand.」</p>

      <p>When he heard me say that, Kamyua Yost nodded sagely</p>

      <p>「That’s right. People can live a healthy life by eating aria, poitan, and meat every day. Not just that, they are cheaper than the other vegetables too, a perfect ingredient. Not just travelers, soldiers will add jerky and dried aria into their poitan soup too.」</p>

      <p>「Soldiers too?」</p>

      <p>「Yes. I’m not talking about the guards in town, but soldiers in a war zone. And of course, the aristocratic commanders will be enjoying fine cuisine in the safety of a castle.」</p>

      <p>I said 「I see,」 and brushed off Kamyua Yost’s joke.</p>

      <p>「Why are you so interested in the diet of a traveler? Are you planning to abandon Genos and run away to Jaguar or Semu?」</p>

      <p>「That’s impossible. It is almost time for me to hand the kiba jerky to the Semu caravan. I’m curious how the jerky they bought will be eaten.」</p>

      <p>「Hmm? Then you should ask the people from the caravan. The way the food is prepared for easterners and westerners is different.」</p>

      <p>「No, they won’t be eating them, they will be reselling to customers on their journey. The ones tasting jerky will be westerners. So I want to listen to your opinion.」</p>

      <p>When he heard me say that, Kamyua Yost clapped his hands excitedly.</p>

      <p>「I see, reselling, huh. The further away from Genos, the fewer bias people will have towards kiba. That’s great business sense.」</p>

      <p>「Is that so? Thinking about it carefully, those people are willing to buy kiba jerky from me at the market price of Karon jerky. If they want to make a profit by reselling it, the kiba jerky will be sold at a higher price than Karon jerky. Can they really sell it?」</p>

      <p>「You don’t need to worry. Karon and Kimyusu are very cheap in Genos. In some cities that don’t have large livestock farm, the price of meat will be twice that of here.」</p>

      <p>I see, I thought to myself quietly.</p>

      <p>Contrary to my expectations, the longer I talked to him, the more useful information I obtained. I heard that Kamyua Yost spent most of his time every year wandering the world, so he was very knowledgeable.</p>

      <p>「So there are farms raising Karon and Kimyusu as cattle. No wonder the price of these two types of meat is relatively stable.」</p>

      <p>「That’s right, the neighboring city Dabaggu is renowned for their large Karon farm. It is within half a day’s ride on a Totos. That’s why they would send large amount of Karon meat to Genos everyday… But the people in the Post Station Town can only eat the leg meat of the Karon.」</p>

      <p>「Eh, is that so?」</p>

      <p>「Yes, the meat from Karon’s torso tastes nicer and is more tender than the leg meat, so the castle town would buy all the torso meat, resulting in the Karon meat in the Post Station Town being so cheap.」</p>

      <p>I couldn’t ignore these words.</p>

      <p>「I’m sorry, but are the Karon jerky sold in the Post Station Town also made from leg meat?」</p>

      <p>「Probably. Only travelers and soldiers would eat jerky. The calf meat tastes worse than the thigh meat and cost less too, so they probably made jerky from the calf meat… What’s the matter? Why do you look so serious?」</p>

      <p>「No, my stall had only been using the chest meat of the kiba to make jerky. Because the thigh and shoulder meat that doesn’t have much fats tastes more bland when made into jerky.」</p>

      <p>Even so, why wasn’t the jerky business improving at all?</p>

      <p>Seeing how troubled I looked, Kamyua Yost stroked his thin chin.</p>

      <p>「The kiba jerky you gifted me last time does taste better than the Karon jerky sold in the Post Station Town. However, travelers won’t care too much about the taste of jerky too much. They will soak it in the poitan soup anyway, so they can’t tell the difference in taste anyway.」</p>

      <p>「In that case, what about using powdered poitan as food? It can be eaten after grilling it on a journey. The jerky and aria can be boiled in water, which will be a sumptuous meal.」</p>

      <p>「Yes, that’s a great idea. But right now, only the denizens of Forest’s Edge know how to grill the powdered poitan into a form like fuwano, right?」</p>

      <p>「Ah, that’s true. Then, we can spread this skill in the Post Station Town…」</p>

      <p>「Asuta, is that really fine?」</p>

      <p>Kamyua Yost’s tone changed.</p>

      <p>He didn’t have his usual pretending-to-be-retarded smile and was grinning sagely instead.</p>

      <p>「Asuta, you are selling kiba food in the Post Station Town, so for every 100 meals you sell, there would be 100 Karon or Kimyusu dishes that won’t be sold. But despite that, your business is still unaffected, do you know why?」</p>

      <p>「The reason, huh… Because the people in town fear the denizens of Forest’s Edge?」</p>

      <p>「That’s not it. Like I said, the people from Dabaggu are the ones selling the meat in Genos. The snack stall owners might be unhappy about their sales dropping, but they are just the wives of innkeepers earning chump change on the sideline. Even if their stall closes down, they won’t become homeless and wander the streets.」</p>

      <p>「I see…」</p>

      <p>「It’s the same for the Dabaggu people, their losses aren’t that heavy that they will pick trouble with you. After all, Genos isn’t their only clients, and they will sell tens of Karon every day. They will sell a few less Karon at most, and only the cheap leg meat. They won’t be happy about it, but it isn’t worth complaining about, and they will at most click their tongue and forget it… However, if you intend to expand your business through the sale of poitan, you need to be careful.」</p>

      <p>But why? I asked him with a look.</p>

      <p>Kamyua Yost put an elbow on the table and smiled quietly.</p>

      <p>「Because the people in the castle town raise fuwano crops, while the Post Station Town people grow the cheap poitan. If the people of Post Station Town find out how delicious poitan are and won’t buy fuwano, the nobles who manage the northern farmlands will suffer huge losses. Can you imagine how dangerous this is?」</p>

      <p>「Is that so… I can understand that…」</p>

      <p>「I’m not stopping you from doing this, but you are trying to improve relations with the people in the city right now, so doing that is dangerous. Teaching the people of the Post Station Town how to make poitan delicious is a dangerous weapon against the nobles, I hope you can keep this in mind.」</p>

      <p>「…」</p>

      <p>「In order to live on, there are times when you need to wield your blade. But if you mistime the moment you wield your blade, you might hurt your allies. Be careful when you wield a blade.」</p>

      <p>Kamyua Yost smiled cockily after saying that.</p>

      <h3 id="sigil_toc_id_11">2</h3>

      <p>I bade Kamyua Yost farewell and, when I returned to the Fa house, there were already several women waiting for me there.</p>

      <p>「Hi, everyone’s so early… Hmm? What’s the matter?」</p>

      <p>「Here, the jerky as promised.」</p>

      <p>The timing was just right. I asked these houses to help me make the jerky ordered by the 《Silver Vase》.</p>

      <p>Shumimaru’s Semu caravan 《Silver Vase》 ordered 40 kg of jerky from me. I felt that this was a good chance to distribute the wealth to everyone, so I not only bought meat from them, but also asked them to make the jerky.</p>

      <p>「Thank you, everyone. I will check one at a time.」</p>

      <p>Rii Sudora and I brought the equipment for the stall into the room and then ushered the women in.</p>

      <p>There were members from the three houses here, which were the Fou, Latzu and Gazu houses. The Latzu and Gazu houses were further away from the Fa house, so this was the first time I had met the women from their houses.</p>

      <p>「Let me start first.」</p>

      <p>The woman from the Fou house gave me a large sack used to carry vegetables.</p>

      <p>I opened the sack and saw a lot of jerky rolling around inside. I picked one palm-sized jerky at random and then sliced off the edge with a knife.</p>

      <p>They used Pico leaves and salt to completely remove the moisture before smoking it, and the jerky became as tough as wood. I put the slice of jerky into my mouth, and the strong saltiness and taste of herbs, as well as the condensed taste of the kiba, spread in my mouth.</p>

      <p>The taste was fine. They used meat that had been properly bloodlet.</p>

      <p>I then placed the jerky on a board and then cut the tough jerky cleanly in two from the middle. The jerky was rock hard, proving that the middle was completely dry.</p>

      <p>「Well then, thank you for your hard work… Erm, please wait a moment.」</p>

      <p>I picked out the copper plates from today’s earnings and handed them to the woman from the Fou house.</p>

      <p>「Seven white copper plates and red copper plates each, please check it.」</p>

      <p>「… Yes.」</p>

      <p>The woman’s face turned as stiff as the jerky.</p>

      <p>Seven white copper plates and red copper plates each. In terms of tusks and horns, that was roughly six kiba worth.</p>

      <p>It was rare for the denizens of Forest’s Edge to sell such a large amount of jerky. Hence, such a chance might not come again. Even if it did, I would arrange for the other houses to take the job. I already told them this plenty of times when I gave them this job, but even so, the remuneration was immense for them.</p>

      <p>「Well, next batch of jerky, please.」</p>

      <p>The jerky brought in by the Latzu and Gazu houses was fine too.</p>

      <p>The women didn’t look overjoyed and looked relieved instead. They accepted the copper plates respectfully.</p>

      <p>「Asuta, the Sudora house will bring you the jerky tomorrow, we will be in your care.」</p>

      <p>Rii Sudora who was seated beside me bowed courteously.</p>

      <p>At this moment, someone knocked on the door from the outside.</p>

      <p>「I’m Ema Min Lutim, I have brought four women from the Wu clan kin houses over. Is Ai Fa or Asuta in?」</p>

      <p>Ah, it was Ema Min Lutim again. I stood up.</p>

      <p>Ema Min Lutim visited the Fa house yesterday and two days ago too. She brought 3 Totos yesterday and one Totos the day before yesterday.</p>

      <p>Did she find more Totos? I opened the door carefully and was relieved to only see women from the Forest’s Edge in front of me.</p>

      <p>I saw an unexpected face. It was a girl of petite stature, her brown hair was tied up like an onion… She used to be the youngest daughter of the Tsun clan, but was now a member of the Lutim house, Zwei.</p>

      <p>「Hello, Ema Min Lutim. I didn’t expect to see you three days in a row, is there anything I can do for you today?」</p>

      <p>「Yes, I’m visiting with my family Zwei. She wants to ask you something… Let’s finish the work with these women first, alright? They have brought the jerky they made with them.」</p>

      <p>There were women from the Lilim, Mufa and Mamu houses, kins of the Wu clan I wasn’t familiar with.</p>

      <p>When splitting the job of making the jerky, I prioritized the poorer houses as much as possible. But only the Fou, Latzu, Gazu and Sudora houses learned to bloodlet by the deadline. So I gave the rest of the jobs to the Wu clan. Mama Mia Lei then used her discretion to assign the job of making jerky to the houses who were not so well off as the Wu clan and Lutim house.</p>

      <p>Some kin houses of the Wu clan were impoverished like the minor houses, the Fou and Latzu. The women weren’t dressed as nicely as the Wu clan members and had a plain air about them.</p>

      <p>The denizens of Forest’s Edge were hardworking and honest, no matter how wealthy they were. All the jerky they brought was fine and good enough to sell.</p>

      <p>「Alright, it’s fine. Thank you, everyone, for your hard work. I will ask you for help again if the chance arises.」</p>

      <p>「We are very thankful too… Asuta of the Fa house, will we get in your way if we observe your work?」</p>

      <p>The woman from the Mamu house asked.</p>

      <p>「It’s fine.」</p>

      <p>After answering, I turned towards Zwei.</p>

      <p>「But before that, you have business with me, right? What’s the matter?」</p>

      <p>Was it a grave matter related to the Tsun clan?</p>

      <p>Zwei grunted 「Hmmp!」 and then folded her slender arms before her chest.</p>

      <p>「Let me tell you first, this won’t be a short conversation, you know? It might last until the sun goes down, are you okay with that?」</p>

      <p>「That will be troubling. I need to prepare for my business tomorrow, as well as dinner.」</p>

      <p>「In that case, you can listen to me as you work! If you don’t give me a satisfactory answer, I won’t go back to the Lutim house!」</p>

      <p>She appeared a little emotionally unstable.</p>

      <p>With no other choice, I prepared the ingredients needed for my work and started dicing the aria as I listened to Zwei.</p>

      <p>「Asuta of the Fa house, you asked seven houses to make jerky, right? I want to confirm something about that.」</p>

      <p>「Ehh? You want to talk about jerky?」</p>

      <p>「Yes, what else should I talk about?」</p>

      <p>Only six days had passed since Zwei’s grandfather Tay Tsun passed away. I thought she would be talking about that and even braced myself for it. It seems like I thought too much.</p>

      <p>「The remuneration for this job is seven white copper plates and red copper plates each, correct? And the jerky will require the chest meat of two large kiba… Anything wrong so far?」</p>

      <p>「Yes, you are right.」</p>

      <p>I asked each house to prepare 6 kg of jerky.</p>

      <p>To make 6 kg of jerky, roughly 15 kg of abdomen meat was needed. In order to extend the preservation period, all of its moisture had to be removed.</p>

      <p>「… In that case, why did you only pay 12 red copper plates to the Wu clan?」</p>

      <p>「Huh?」</p>

      <p>「The Wu clan sells one kiba to the Fa house every day, correct? Even though one kiba only costs 12 red copper plates, just the jerky from the chest meat alone can earn 77 red copper plates? Isn’t these numbers strange?」</p>

      <p>She glared at me with her eyes where the white part was more prominent as she spoke with a screechy voice.</p>

      <p>「Well…」</p>

      <p>I chopped the aria as I calculated in my head.</p>

      <p>「First, I need to tell you something. The price of fresh kiba meat being too low has always been bothering me. But there isn’t any so-called market price for kiba meat, so we are pricing the meat of the kiba based on their tusks and horns.」</p>

      <p>Or rather, Mama Mia Lei insisted that the Wu clan had plenty of excess meat and didn’t want any money for them. I had to convince her with such a price.</p>

      <p>「… And so? How did you come up with the price of jerky?」</p>

      <p>「I used the Karon jerky sold in the Post Station Town as a reference. I asked everyone to make 600 red copper plates worth of jerky; the Fa house will take 10 percent as commission and divide the rest equally among the seven houses.」</p>

      <p>「Every house is paid 77 red copper plates… which is equal to 539 red copper plates, the Fa house only takes 61 red copper plates. Hmmp, looks like your calculations are correct.」</p>

      <p>The eight women around us listening in looked troubled. Their mental arithmetics probably couldn’t keep up with us. Besides, they thought such things were meaningless.</p>

      <p>Zwei wasn’t fazed by their reactions and rambled on.</p>

      <p>「In that case, the price of the fresh meat should be benchmarked against the price of fresh meat in the Post Station Town too, right? How much does the meat of that Karon thing cost? Not 12 red copper plates for one, correct?」</p>

      <p>「I had never been to a butcher, but the price of meat you buy for your personal needs and bulk purchases by inns or stalls are several folds different. That might be so, but the price of the kiba right now is really low.」</p>

      <p>「So how much does it cost exactly?」</p>

      <p>Was she testing my mental arithmetics?</p>

      <p>Normally, 100 g of Karon meat costs one red copper plate. When the 《Big Tree of the South Inn》 procured the same amount of meat, they could push the price down to as low as 0.37 red copper plates.</p>

      <p>I used 12 red copper plates to purchase around 40 kg of meat from the Wu clan. I didn’t know what kind of animal the Karon was, or how big it was. I didn’t know how much one Karon cost, so I had to assume it weighed as much as a kiba.<br class="kix-line-break"/></p>

      <p>Which meant…</p>

      <p>In a normal market, 1 kg of Karon cost 10 red copper plates, so 40 kg will cost 400 red copper plates.</p>

      <p>If I calculate in terms of bulk sale, 1 kg is 0.37 red copper plates, so 40 kg will be… 148 plates.</p>

      <p>The difference between these two numbers was huge, but normal people won’t buy 40 kg of meat in one shot. The price was so high because they are buying in small quantities.</p>

      <p>「Anyway, the bulk sale price is about 148 red copper plates.」</p>

      <p>「It seems like you are oppressing the Wu clan and buying at less than a tenth of the price!」</p>

      <p>Zwei shouted and then squinted her eyes suspiciously.</p>

      <p>「And isn’t 148 red copper plates too little? How much does the same amount of jerky cost?」</p>

      <p>「When making jerky, its weigh will fall by more than half, if we compare the price of fresh meat with jerky… Hold on.」</p>

      <p>100 g of Karon jerky was 1.5 red copper plates.</p>

      <p>If the bulk price of Karon meat was 0.37 red copper plates…</p>

      <p>「Hmm, the price of jerky is four times that of fresh meat.」</p>

      <p>「Four times!? Why so much!?」</p>

      <p>「Rock salt is used when making jerky, and, considering the expenses involved, this is a reasonable price, right? There is also the workmanship involved in making jerky, and the cost will increase if you buy from a retailer instead of a supplier.」</p>

      <p>「… I don’t understand. It feels like I have been conned.」</p>

      <p>Was that true? Then let’s do a thorough calculation.</p>

      <p>If we made 10 kg of fresh meat into jerky today, we would need to preserve it with Pico leaves and marinate it with salt. After smoking it, the fresh meat would shrink to 4 kg of jerky. The salt used was about 5% of the meat’s weight. 10 kg required 500 g of salt, which was 3 red copper plates.</p>

      <p>The 10 kg of fresh meat was priced at 37 red copper plates, and after adding the price of the rock salt, that would be exactly 40 red copper plates. The price of jerky was 1.5 red copper plates per 100 g, 4 kg would be 60 red copper plates.</p>

      <p>The ingredient cost of 40 divided by the price of 60, multiplied by 100, that would be 66%.</p>

      <div class="imgBox">
        <img src="../Images/0008.png" alt="Illustration"/><!--  https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/JrNGqsZd9NtvOUGr-ikoVNvRM4RkHwoTts5iInpSjLYtvPckQdMzifjPN77PUtBfAGSQ0kBFHuh0kFbzPNiBYpZDTZPViDmhQnTFMFW7duKYD5WIjBTMuk4SoxEewCe5_h84VDXG  -->
      </div>

      <p>So the price was very reasonable and not expensive at all.</p>

      <p>I concluded by using the actual numbers:</p>

      <p>「The cost of fresh meat is 37 red copper plates, while the price of jerky is 60 red copper plates… Taking away the cost of rock salt, the earnings are 20 red copper plates, you know? Is that really cheap?」</p>

      <p>「This price isn’t cheap in Genos. However, their strategy revolves around selling large quantities with thin margins, so the calculations would be roughly the same even if you use Karon meat instead of the kiba that I’m selling.」</p>

      <p>If I prepared the meat myself, the cost ratio of the 『Kiba burger』 would just be 25%. If I used Karon meat instead, the cost ratio would spike to 65.8%. Simply put, the same would apply to the other stalls too.</p>

      <p>「Hmmp… so in order to earn money, you are buying meat from the Wu clan for cheap?」</p>

      <p>「You misunderstand. I had negotiated with them many times to raise the selling price, but Mia Lei Wu refused to accept. She thinks the excess meat should just be returned to the forest anyway.」</p>

      <p>This girl had an economic sense that the denizens of Forest’s Edge lacked. With her standing right before me, I couldn’t help feeling that this was a good chance to set an appropriate price for kiba meat within Forest’s Edge.</p>

      <p>「Well, Zwei and Ema Min Lutim, can you help me tell Mia Lei Wu that I want to amend the selling price of kiba meat? Not just for the Wu clan, I plan to buy meat from the other houses too, so I want to use this chance to set an adequate price.」</p>

      <p>「I see. Are you going to set the price at 148 red copper plates, just like Karon meat? The price will rocket ten times.」</p>

      <p>「I’m fine with that. Or rather, this is the right choice. Our goal is to let the people of the Post Station Town buy the kiba meat at an adequate price.」</p>

      <p>Zwei finally quieted down and looked at me as I finished up chopping the aria.</p>

      <p>「… I get it. Looks like you really want to let all denizens of Forest’s Edge benefit and aren’t taking all the profit for yourself.」</p>

      <p>「Of course. This might sound a little cocky, but the Fa house won’t have anywhere to spend the money no matter how much we earn.」</p>

      <p>「But you can buy anything with copper plates.」</p>

      <p>「Is that so? Copper plates can’t buy bonds and trust, right?」</p>

      <p>After I made that joke, Zwei grunted loudly.</p>

      <p>「I was planning to interrogate you until it gets dark, but it ended so quickly.」</p>

      <p>「That’s wonderful. Zwei, it has been a meaningful discussion, I’m very satisfied.」</p>

      <p>I wasn’t being polite, I really felt that way.</p>

      <p>In the Forest’s Edge, Zwei who was so obsessed with copper plates was an abnormality. However, in order to bring prosperity into Forest’s Edge, someone with economic senses like her was necessary. Speaking of which, the most out-of-place person in Forest’s Edge was me. This was the first time I met a fellow tribe mate who could see things from the same perspective as me. I was secretly happy that an abnormality like her was now a kin of the Wu clan.</p>

      <p>「I finished my business. What now, Ema Min Lutim?」</p>

      <p>「Well, there are no chores to do even if we rush back, so let’s observe Asuta’s cooking.」</p>

      <p>Ema Min Lutim smiled happily, and Zwei wavered uneasily when she saw Ema’s smile.</p>

      <p>At this moment, someone pulled open the door from outside without any hesitation.</p>

      <p>Only a family member could open the door without permission, so, naturally, the one who entered was Ai Fa. Ai Fa was also heaving a 60 kg kiba on her shoulder today, and she threw a sharp sideway glance at the scene inside the room.</p>

      <p>「Welcome back, house head. So you hunted something today too.」</p>

      <p>After Ai Fa restarted hunting two days ago, this was the second kiba she got. There wasn’t many kiba during this season, but the harvest by the Fa house was incredibly bountiful.</p>

      <p>I received the house head with a smile, but she showed a cold expression and said: 「You seem really happy today, huh.」. She didn’t enter and just closed the door.</p>

      <p>What did she mean by happy? I was clueless.</p>

      <p>The only thing different today was that there were nine women in here with me, and many women had been visiting recently. Maybe this was a bit too many.</p>

      <p>「… Sorry, Asuta.」</p>

      <p>Ema Min Lutim bowed towards me.</p>

      <p>「Huh? Ah, no, you don’t need to apologize.」</p>

      <p>「Is that so?」</p>

      <p>She tilted her head and then leaned towards my ear.</p>

      <p>「Aside from me and the lady from the Sudora house, everyone else is young unwed women, so maybe Ai Fa is unhappy about that?」</p>

      <p>I was shocked and stared at Ema Min Lutim who was leaning in. There was a cheeky smile that befitted her age on her ever-calm face.</p>

      <p>And so, the 22nd of the Blue month ended peacefully.</p>
