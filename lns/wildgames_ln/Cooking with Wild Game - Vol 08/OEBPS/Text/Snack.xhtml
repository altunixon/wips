    <h2>Mid-Meal Snack: <span epub:type="subtitle">The Melancholy of the Wu Clan’s Eldest Daughter</span></h2>

    <p>Vena Wu melancholically watched her kins enjoying themselves at the banquet.</p>

    <p>Today was a wedding banquet of the head of the Lilim house taking a woman from the Lei house as his wife, and it was held in the Wu clan plaza. All one hundred-odd kins were here to witness this marriage. Torches were lit all around the plaza, and makeshift stoves were used to grill meat or reheat the soup. The celebration was so heated that it was bordering on madness.</p>

    <p>Aside from influential people, a wedding wouldn’t normally be held in the Wu clan plaza with all the kins in attendance. The banquet today was special. Because the Lilim house that wasn’t related to the Wu clan by blood was now a kin of the Wu clan, it was cause for celebration.</p>

    <p>To think a minor house like Lilim can become a kin of the Wu clan…</p>

    <p>Vena Wu who was in an elegant banquet attire sighed quietly in the night.</p>

    <p>Vena Wu just turned 15 a few days ago. Denizens of Forest's Edge could be wed when they were 15. Young people of marriageable age would seek out their spouses during such banquets. And so, Vena Wu hid in an inconspicuous corner of the plaza and looked at the figures of her kins enjoying the party from afar.</p>

    <p>I just turned 15, so why are so many people proposing to me…</p>

    <p>Vena Wu thought as she looked at the bride and groom clinging to each other on the ceremonial stage.</p>

    <p>The head of the Lilim house was a man in his prime who was close to 40. His bride was a 16 years old girl from the Lei house.</p>

    <p>The difference in age wasn’t important; the head of the Lilim house was a capable hunter and had to leave his strong bloodline behind. Since he got widowed while he was still young, it was only natural for him to remarry. For powerful hunters, this was part of their noble obligations.</p>

    <p>The Lilim house was a surprisingly small house. Including the house head, they only had four members and two young children. Normally, such a minor house couldn’t become a kin of the Wu clan. Vena Wu could understand if they forsook their family name and joined the Wu clan. After all, according to the tradition in Forest's Edge, it was only natural for the weak houses to lose their family name.</p>

    <p>Despite that, the Wu clan allowed the Lilim house to join them as a kin house. Amongst the Wu clan’s kins, the Lei house was the third largest, right behind the Wu clan and Lutim house. After obtaining permission from the six house heads led by Donda Wu, the Lilim house took in a Lei house woman in marriage. They became related to the Lei house through marriage and were now the seventh kin house of the Wu clan.</p>

    <p>It went without saying that there were heated arguments at the start, but the head of the Lilim house showed great sincerity and prowess as a hunter, and his wish got granted.</p>

    </div>

    <p>Vena Wu heard that the girl from the Lei house also showed her will and determination to the head of the Lei house and Donda Wu. This couple met each other along the road, but they yearned for each other so strongly and won this uphill battle. Just what kind of emotions made them do something so reckless? The young Vena Wu couldn’t imagine.</p>

    <p>They could actually fall so deeply for another person… I’m very envious, but on the other hand, it fills me with fear…</p>

    <p>The men who proposed to Vena Wu or expressed their wish to marry into the clan for her were as numerous as the stars. As the eldest daughter of the Wu clan main house, Vena Wu couldn’t be wed to someone of dubious standings. She got her hands full dealing with the Wu clan branch houses, the Lei house, the Lutim house and men from other powerful houses. Turning down all these men one at a time annoyed her to no end.</p>

    <p>I didn’t even talk much with them, why did they think I’m someone they can spend the rest of their lives with…</p>

    <p>Vena Wu couldn’t understand.</p>

    <p>She was convinced that these people were only after her looks or her status as the eldest daughter of the Wu clan.</p>

    <p>They don’t care what kind of person I am… How can I marry a man like that?</p>

    <p>Vena Wu didn’t share her thoughts with them.</p>

    <p>Vena Wu who was just 15 understood that very few people in Forest's Edge had the same troubles as her.</p>

    <p>There wasn’t any need for a reason to love somebody. After falling in love, you would want to spend the rest of your life with them, share all your joy and suffering, and the urge to raise children would come naturally. There was no need for reasons or words… Vena Wu grew up where such an idea was prominent.</p>

    <p>Vena Wu’s parents met few times during banquets and decided to marry. But even so, they still loved each other deeply and had seven children. After twenty years of marriage, their feelings for each other remained unchanged. This was the way that the denizens of Forest's Edge should have.</p>

    <p>… How did they manage to do that…</p>

    <p>Vena Wu loved her family deeply. To her, her parents, grandmother, great-grandmother, and siblings were all irreplaceable existences. If the heavens were to take any one of them, she would gladly go in their place. She couldn’t bear seeing righteous souls of her family return to the forest, while someone with a twisted personality like her gets to live. That was how deeply Vena Wu loved her ten family members.</p>

    <p>A thought arose in her. If she couldn’t love her spouse with the same feelings, there was no point in getting married.</p>

    <p>… Everyone has so sincere thoughts; why am I the only one with such twisted thinking…?</p>

    <p>Vena Wu sighed as she thought about that. She had lost count of how many times she had sighed today.</p>

    <p>At this moment, some noise came from the trees beside her.</p>

    <p>Was it the pup of a Gizu? Vena Wu stood up hurriedly.</p>

    <p>However, it wasn’t a beast but a man of Forest's Edge wearing a hunter’s cape and a saber by his waist.</p>

    <p>Vena Wu sighed in relief, but the man seemed troubled. He looked around him and was more flustered than Vena Wu. He knelt down on one knee as if he was pleading for something.</p>

    <p>「Pardon me for surprising you. I didn’t come here with malicious intent.」</p>

    <p>Vena Wu didn’t understand what he was saying in the beginning.</p>

    <p>However, his words fermented slowly in her mind, and she backed away on reflex.</p>

    <p>「You… You are not a kin of the Wu clan…」</p>

    <p>「Yes, I’m from the Dai house. My name is Diru Dai, I’m the second son of the main house.」</p>

    <p>Vena Wu had never heard of this house before.</p>

    <p>No matter what, this man wasn’t a kin of the Wu clan.</p>

    <p>「Why is someone from the Dai house intruding into the Wu clan village…? As you can see, we are having a wedding today…」</p>

    <p>「Yes, I’m sorry. I heard that the scale of the Wu clan banquets is very big, so I couldn’t suppress my curiosity and came to take a look.」</p>

    <p>Diru Dai didn’t look particularly ferocious or brave and seemed a little weak amongst the men of Forest's Edge.</p>

    <p>He was tall but wasn’t bulky, and his expression had a hint of gentleness. Diru Dai had brown hair that reached his shoulders and meek-looking brown eyes. Vena Wu was used to the fierce and strong appearance of men in the Wu clan, so Diru Dai seemed unreliable to her.</p>

    <p>「Curiosity, huh… But isn’t it against the customs of Forest's Edge to peek at the banquet of a house that isn’t your kin…?」</p>

    <p>「I can’t deny that. I have been feeling melancholic recently and lost control.」</p>

    <p>Even his words sounded weak. Was he someone from the Post Station Town pretending to be a hunter from Forest's Edge? Vena Wu couldn’t help imagining.</p>

    <p>「… Why are you melancholic…?」</p>

    <p>She only asked on a whim.</p>

    <p>After all, this young man seemed incapable of harming Vena Wu. Besides… compared to her kins who looked so happy, she felt closer to the gloomy young man. She was more suited to being with dreary people today. She couldn’t refute that she harbored such depressing thoughts.</p>

    <p>Diru Dai remained on one knee and blinked.</p>

    <p>「Right… No, this isn’t something I can tell others…」</p>

    <p>「I won’t force you if you don’t want to tell me… But since you surprised me, shouldn’t you tell me about it as compensation…?」</p>

    <p>「Alright… I just… fell for someone who has a huge difference in status from me, and it fills me with pain.」</p>

    <p>「Is that so…」</p>

    <p>Vena Wu was a little disappointed.</p>

    <p>「So it’s love troubles, huh… I was hoping for something more interesting…」</p>

    <p>「T-That’s rather mean. For me, it’s something that will decide my future.」</p>

    <p>「The subject will definitely think that… But to think a man could be troubled over something like this…」</p>

    <p>「Of course I will feel troubled. Choosing a spouse is the most important matter in one’s life, correct? It’s the same for both men and women.」</p>

    <p>「Really…?」</p>

    <p>Vena Wu said disinterestedly and then sat down on the log again.</p>

    <p>「It’s my first time seeing a man talking about such things with a woman… You are really weird…」</p>

    <p>「You are the one who asked me to tell you.」</p>

    <p>Diru Dai said and suddenly raised the corners of his lips.</p>

    <p>「You are also weird. Are all women in the Wu clan strong and cold like you?」</p>

    <p>「… This has nothing to do with the Wu clan… I’m just me…」</p>

    <p>Vena Wu answered a little unhappily, and Diru Dai continued smiling, but his eyes were a little sad.</p>

    <p>「I see. But if the denizens of Forest's Edge didn’t place so much emphasis on one’s heritage, I wouldn’t have to be so troubled. I’m proud to be a denizen of Forest's Edge… but I hate the customs of Forest's Edge.」</p>

    <p>「You are exaggerating…」</p>

    <p>Vena Wu shrugged.</p>

    <p>「Just who did you fell for… Is it a kin of the Wu clan…?」</p>

    <p>「No, it’s…」</p>

    <p>「What are you doing!」</p>

    <p>When Diru Dai was about to answer, a stern yell came from the direction of the plaza.</p>

    <p>Vena Wu’s older and younger brother, Jiza Wu and Darum Wu came over.</p>

    <p>「Who the hell are you? You are not a kin of the Wu clan, correct? Are you from the Tsun clan?」</p>

    <p>Darum Wu reached for the blade at his waist as he asked a series of questions. He was just fourteen but was tall and a very capable hunter. After seeing Darum Wu’s burning blue eyes that were just the same as Papa Donda’s, Diru Dai quickly lowered his head.</p>

    <p>「No, I’m from the Dai house. I don’t wish to intrude into the Wu clan’s banquet…」</p>

    <p>「The Dai house is a minor house situated further to the north, correct?」</p>

    <p>Jiza Wu asked calmly this time.</p>

    <p>Even though Jiza Wu’s voice and expression were calm and steady, his body was much bulkier than his brother. Jiza Wu who just turned eighteen could already make it into the elite eight in the contest of might.</p>

    <p>「No matter what, houses not related to the Wu clan may not participate in the banquet. Hurry up and leave.」</p>

    <p>「No, that’s…」</p>

    <p>「If you don’t leave, that would be committing the taboo of transpassing the home of another family. I will have to take your toe.」</p>

    <p>Diru Dai stood up, his face twisted from sadness, and his head hung low.</p>

    <p>「I will leave right now. I apologize for my impudent actions… Farewell.」</p>

    <p>「Ah, wait…」</p>

    <p>When he heard Vena Wu’s words, the youth glanced at her sadly and disappeared into the night.</p>

    <p>「What a suspicious man, I should inform the clan head Donda.」</p>

    <p>After saying that, Jiza Wu looked at Vena Wu with his slit-like eyes.</p>

    <p>「You should call for us when you see a suspicious character. Why did you chat with him so leisurely?」</p>

    <p>「It’s nothing… I only talked with him because I was bored…」</p>

    <p>「Vena, you are the only one who thinks this is boring.」</p>

    <p>Jiza Wu tilted his thick neck quizzedly.</p>

    <p>「It’s almost time for the women to dance and you should get ready too.」</p>

    <p>「Don’t wanna… I don’t want to dance…」</p>

    <p>「You are already 15; you should dance for everyone so you can find a good spouse.」</p>

    <p>Jiza Wu insisted, but Darum Wu spoke up for her:</p>

    <p>「It’s fine even if she doesn’t dance. Even if you leave her alone, there will still be plenty of men proposing to her. She doesn’t need to flaunt her beauty; leave the chance to the other girls.」</p>

    <p>「Darum, thank you… you are so gentle…」</p>

    <p>「Don't treat me like a kid, I’m already a hunter.」</p>

    <p>Darum Wu showed a vicious face, but Vena Wu just found that adorable. Even though Darum Wu was already taller than Vena Wu and had stopped addressing her as an elder sister, Vena Wu still thought of Darum Wu as a cute little brother.</p>

    <p>「Jiza-nii, you should go back to the plaza…? This is your only chance to speak with Sati Lei, right…?」</p>

    <p>Jiza Wu stared at Vena Wu’s face, shrugged his massive shoulders, and returned to the plaza.</p>

    <p>Darum Wu watched him go and then leaned against the tree that Vena Wu was sitting under.</p>

    <p>「Darum, aren’t you going back…?」</p>

    <p>「I’m just 14 and can’t choose my spouse yet. There’s no point in watching the girls dance.」</p>

    <p>He said crudely.</p>

    <p>He was staying with Vena Wu because he was worried that Diru Dai would come back; that was his personality.</p>

    <p>By the way… Just what is with that Diru Dai…</p>

    <p>With her precious younger brother accompanying her, Vena Wu lowered her head and pondered.</p>

    <p>Vena Wu would find out in the near future.</p>

    <hr/>

    <p>The next morning, everyone was busy cleaning up after the banquet.</p>

    <p>They needed to clean up after the party of over a hundred people, so just dismantling the temporary stone stoves and the ceremonial stage was tedious work. They had to deal with the remnants of the bonfire, clean the pots and plates that were used, and dump the kiba bones into the woods. When they finished all these tasks, the sun was already high in the sky.</p>

    <p>「Alright then, let’s start doing our usual chores. We will forage for firewood and herbs; please tan the hides and do the house chores.」</p>

    <p>After their mother Mia Lei Wu gave her instructions, she left for the woods with a few others. Kiba would wake from their slumber at noon, so they had to hurry and forage for firewood, Pico leaves and lilo in the morning. Vena Wu and her sisters were left to house sit and finish the tasks assigned by their mother.</p>

    <p>「Vena-nee, the bride from the Lei house yesterday was very pretty.」</p>

    <p>They laid out the kiba hide in a sunny place, and Leina Wu started speaking.</p>

    <p>Leina Wu was twelve years old and Vena Wu’s first younger sister. Leina Wu possessed black hair, which was rare in the Wu clan, tied up into twin tails and had an innocent smile.</p>

    <p>「The next ones to be wedded should be Jiza-nii and Sati Lei, right? Everyone will have to come to the Wu clan and celebrate again.」</p>

    <p>「Yes, that’s true…」</p>

    <p>「I’m looking forward to it. Vena-nee, when are you getting married?」</p>

    <p>Seeing her sister’s expectant eyes, Vena Wu responded with a heavy gaze.</p>

    <p>「I’m just 15… I don’t want to have a spouse so soon…」</p>

    <p>「Ehh? But everyone wants to marry you! Did you turn them all down?」</p>

    <p>「… As the eldest daughter of the Wu clan main house, I can’t choose a partner so thoughtlessly…」</p>

    <p>Vena Wu made an offhand excuse, and Leina Wu nodded.</p>

    <p>「I see〜, &#160;but I’m looking forward to your wedding! You are already beautiful, so you will be more mesmerizing than any other women on the day of your wedding.」</p>

    <p>「… I hope so…」</p>

    <p>It was cruel to ask the twelve-year-old Leina Wu to understand how she felt. Vena Wu suppressed her sigh and then hung the hide of the kiba on the rope tied between two trees.</p>

    <p>At this moment, there were shouting sounds from the food store behind them.</p>

    <p>The commotion originated from their younger siblings, Ludo Wu and Lala Wu.</p>

    <p>「What’s all this racket…? You have to do your work properly…」</p>

    <p>「Ludo threw Pico leaves at me! They got into my nose!」</p>

    <p>「Hmmp! You are so short yourself, and you still call me a shorty; it’s your fault!」</p>

    <p>Ludo Wu was ten, and Lala Wu was eight. They were at an mischievous age, but children five years and older had to complete the tasks entrusted to them.</p>

    <p>「Mama Mia Lei will scold you if you waste Pico leaves…」</p>

    <p>「Vena-nee is so noisy… Where did Rimee go?」</p>

    <p>「She went on a stroll with Grandma Jiba just now… Lala, are you alright…?」</p>

    <p>「Yes.」</p>

    <p>Lala Wu rubbed her nose with teary eyes. One could easily sympathize with her appearance, but Ludo wouldn’t bully his sister without reason. Lala Wu must have acted first, which led to Ludo’s retaliation.</p>

    <p>「Really now. I want to be a hunter soon, I can’t wait three years!」</p>

    <p>「If you really think so, work hard and build up your strength… Your body is still so small, you can’t work as a hunter yet…」</p>

    <p>「Vena, even you are saying I’m too small! Just because your butt has gotten bigger~.」</p>

    <p>Ludo Wu’s smacked Vena Wu’s ass with his small palm.</p>

    <p>Vena Wu turned red and cried: 「Stop that!」, but Ludo Wu had already scurried off.</p>

    <p>「Ludo is being such a bother… I have to get Papa Donda to lecture him…」</p>

    <p>「That’s right.」</p>

    <p>Although she said that, Leina Wu was all smiles.</p>

    <p>「Vena-nee, you will become a great wife after all.」</p>

    <p>「Huh…? What do you mean…?」</p>

    <p>「It’s probably because you have many younger siblings, so even though you are just 15, you look no different from a mother!」</p>

    <p>「… But you are better than me at grilling meat and cooking soup…」</p>

    <p>The last night’s wedding probably filled Leina Wu’s mind with weddings and marriage. Vena Wu was the same, but their feelings were worlds apart. That made Vena Wu’s mood even heavier.</p>

    <p>「Alright, that’s it with the hide… I will go chop some wood. Leina, can you go sun the Pico leaves with Lala…? If there are any signs of rain, remember to shift the hide and Pico leaves under the shade…」</p>

    <p>「Yes, got it!」</p>

    <p>And so, Vena Wu managed to get away from her beloved sister. She took out a machete and wood and then headed to the side of the house by herself.</p>

    <p>Jiza-nii is 18, Sati Lei is 16… when I get older, everyone will rush me to marry…</p>

    <p>Fortunately, her mother who was in charge of all the women— Mia Lei Wu wasn’t rushing her to wed. Mia Lei Wu thought that Vena Wu just had to wait patiently for her fated partner to appear.</p>

    <p>One day, even Mama Mia Lei will lose her patience… Can I really meet someone I will want to marry…?</p>

    <p>Vena Wu swung her machete while harboring such thoughts.</p>

    <p>The wood got split and rolled off the chopping block.</p>

    <p>She worked quietly, and when she was halfway done, she felt someone approaching her.</p>

    <p>She turned her head back and held her breath in surprise. Diru Dai had appeared before her once again.</p>

    <p>「Sorry for disturbing your work, may I have a word with you?」</p>

    <p>「You… What are you doing here…?」</p>

    <p>「I didn’t intrude in today. I told someone that I was looking for you, and they permitted me to enter the village.」</p>

    <p>Diru Dai smiled gently.</p>

    <p>Now that she was seeing him in the day, Vena Wu found him to be gentler than the other men from the Forest's Edge and a little unreliable.</p>

    <p>「You are looking for me… But you don’t even know my name…?」</p>

    <p>「Yes, I just said I was looking for a beautiful lady with light-colored eyes and hair who is around 15, and they assumed I am looking for Vena Wu from the main house… So you are Vena Wu.」</p>

    <p>Diru Dai stopped a few steps away and didn’t go any closer to Vena Wu.</p>

    <p>It was impossible for him to do anything nefarious in the middle of the Wu clan village. The powerful hunters were resting at home in preparation for their hunt at noon. Moreover, Diru Dai seemed weaker than the youngest hunter in the Wu clan.</p>

    <p>「… What business do you have with me…?」</p>

    <p>「I want to apologize to you for rudeness yesterday. After I told the women from the branch house that, they brought me over unhesitantly.」</p>

    <p>「… I think you should leave before Papa Donda and the rest wake up, you know…?」</p>

    <p>「Yes, I don’t plan to stay for long; I still need to perform my duties as a hunter.」</p>

    <p>Diru Dai said and stayed where he was.</p>

    <p>Vena Wu sighed and waved the machete in her right hand a little.</p>

    <p>「You already apologized yesterday… Is there anything else…?」</p>

    <p>「No… It’s nothing important…」</p>

    <p>Diru Dai narrowed his eyes and smiled sadly.</p>

    <p>「… Vena Wu, you are beautiful.」</p>

    <p>「… What…?」</p>

    <p>「This was on my mind since last night. I have never seen a woman more beautiful than you.」</p>

    <p>「… Didn’t you mention last night that you are in love with a woman? And she isn’t from the Wu clan…?」</p>

    <p>「Yes. But your beauty mesmerized me… However, it is ironic that you are the eldest daughter of the Wu clan.」</p>

    <p>Diru Dai shook his head slowly.</p>

    <p>「I came to see you because I wanted to give up on that impossible love. But to think that you have such a high status… It’s really ironic. Seems like I’m fated to fall for women out of my league.」</p>

    <p>「That has nothing to do with me…」</p>

    <p>Vena Wu pulled back her long fringe and stared at him.</p>

    <p>「You were madly in love with another woman, and you are saying this to me even though we just met… Are your feelings so cheap…?」</p>

    <p>「That’s not true… I have been tormented by a love that won’t bear fruit, so I wanted to rely on you. But it is probably the will of the forest that I experienced such pain once again.」</p>

    <p>「You actually think your own shallowness is the will of the forest; isn’t that too cocky…?」</p>

    <p>After saying that, Vena Wu felt a little puzzled.</p>

    <p>「Diru Dai… you are really a queer man… You are like a man from the city pretending to be a denizen of Forest's Edge…」</p>

    <p>「That’s right, my family often tells me that. I probably turned out this way because I like going to the Post Station Town.」</p>

    <p>「… Do you like the Genos city…?」</p>

    <p>What a surprising statement.</p>

    <p>Diru Dai smiled gently and nodded.</p>

    <p>「That’s right. Even if you ask me, I’m not sure how to answer either. But the people in the city are very free, right? Especially the travelers from Semu and Jaguar, they can just come and go as they please. How do they feel about living such a life? I have always been curious about that.」</p>

    <p>「…」</p>

    <p>「The denizens of Forest's Edge spend their entire lives in the edge of the Morga Forest and would only visit the city occasionally to procure aria and poitan. We never met the people outside. I can’t tell anyone else about this… but such a lifestyle seems too constrictive.」</p>

    <p>「Yes… I think so too…」</p>

    <p>Vena Wu felt her heart start to race.</p>

    <p>That was the thought that Vena Wu hid deep in her heart and had never confessed to her family.</p>

    <p>「The people in the Forest's Edge settlement only see me as the eldest daughter of the Wu clan… The people in the Genos Post Station Town only think of me as a barbaric denizen of Forest's Edge… Will the people far away from Genos treat me like a normal girl…?」</p>

    <p>「Yes, you are right.」</p>

    <p>Diru Dai narrowed his eyes slightly.</p>

    <p>Vena Wu’s heart raced even faster.</p>

    <p>「In that case, you… can just leave the Forest's Edge settlement, right…? Then you won’t need to give up on your feelings…」</p>

    <p>「Ehh?」</p>

    <p>Diru Dai opened his eyes wide.</p>

    <p>Vena Wu leaned closer unconsciously.</p>

    <p>「I don’t know who is the object of your love… But if you leave the forest, you won’t have to worry about the scale of the houses… You will have to abandon your hometown, but your love will blossom, and you can live a blissful life…」</p>

    <p>Diru Dai’s face turned pale, and he backed off a few steps.</p>

    <p>He then held his right fist to his forehead and lowered his head.</p>

    <p>「Oh forest, please forgive this confused denizen… Vena Wu, even if it’s just a joke, you can’t talk about leaving the forest.」</p>

    <p>「…」</p>

    <p>「The forest bestows us with our souls, and our spirit will return to the woods in the future. This law is absolute, and no matter what doubts you may have, you cannot violate this rule.」</p>

    <p>「I see…」</p>

    <p>Vena Wu felt her heart cooling down quickly.</p>

    <p>「I’m saying this for your own good… It seems you would rather give up on your heart’s desire instead of abandoning the forest…」</p>

    <p>「Just harboring such thoughts is desecrating the forest. Besides, there is no way she would agree to this.」</p>

    <p>「In that case, you should find a partner that suits you…」</p>

    <p>Vena Wu had lost interest in this young man.</p>

    <p>Diru Dai was probably showing a sour face. She turned her back towards him, picked up a piece of wood, and set it on the chopping block.</p>

    <p>「Alright then, I still have matters to attend to, could you leave…? You have to hunt too, right…?」</p>

    <p>「I see… Then, may I ask one last thing?」</p>

    <p>Diru Dai went around to Vena Wu’s side with a smile again.</p>

    <p>「I heard that the Lilim house became one of the Wu clan’s kin houses. Even though the Dai house isn’t big, we have more members than the Lilim house and are more powerful. In that case, could the Dai house be part of the Wu clan’s kin…」</p>

    <p>「The head of the Lilim house defeated the head of the Lei house in a contest of might, you know…? Even though he couldn’t defeat Papa Donda and the head of the Lutim house, they still acknowledge his prowess as a hunter… Can you do that…?」</p>

    <p>Vena Wu looked at Diru Dai with a sideways glance.</p>

    <p>「You can be delusional if you want… But I have no intention of marrying a weak man like you, please don’t forget that…」</p>

    <p>Diru Dai smiled sadly.</p>

    <p>Was a person who could smile in such a situation strong or weak? Vena Wu neither knew nor wanted to know.</p>

    <p>「… Sorry for disturbing your work. I will be going now.」</p>

    <p>Vena Wu didn’t answer and continued chopping wood with her machete.</p>

    <p>With Diru Dai gone, Vena Wu was left alone.</p>

    <p>He is just a normal Forest's Edge denizen…</p>

    <p>Diru Dai’s reaction wasn’t strange at all.</p>

    <p>So Vena Wu was the only one with such thoughts after all.</p>

    <p>Was living her entire life in the Forest's Edge settlement the right thing to do? No other denizen of Forest's Edge worried about that.</p>

    <p>I did something stupid…</p>

    <p>She told what she was concealing from her family to someone she met last night. Doing that so thoughtlessly made her emotions even heavier.</p>

    <p>Vena Wu didn’t want to abandon her hometown. Just the thought of leaving her beloved family broke her heart.</p>

    <p>However, she couldn’t forsake this dream of hers either.</p>

    <p>If she really left Forest's Edge, would she be able to live without any regrets? Would she stop troubling over how out of place she was and live on freely?</p>

    <p>… It’s impossible for me to leave this place…</p>

    <p>Vena Wu swung her machete down with all her might.</p>

    <p>The wood seemed to be rotten in the middle and broke into pieces.</p>

    <hr/>

    <p>A few days later, when Vena Wu had finally banished the existence of Diru Dai from her mind, those people appeared.</p>

    <p>It was noon, and the men had entered the woods while the women were taking a short break before embarking on their next chores. Vena Wu was strolling by herself in the village when those people blocked her path arrogantly.</p>

    <p>「Ohh… Are you the eldest daughter of the Wu clan?」</p>

    <p>One of them was a girl with an ominous aura about her.</p>

    <p>The girl was about Vena Wu’s age. Her dark brown hair that had been braided into dreads hung over her shoulders. There was an icy light in her dark eyes, and, despite her beautiful appearance, she felt as dangerous as a snake.</p>

    <p>The other person was a gray-haired old man. He had a well-toned body that befitted a hunter, but his eyes were as murky as a dead man. In another sense, the air around him was as dangerous as that girl.</p>

    <p>「Who are you…? I have never seen you around here before…?」</p>

    <p>「I’m the eldest daughter of the Tsun clan, Yamiel Tsun. This is Tay Tsun from the branch house.」</p>

    <p>When Vena Wu heard her answer, she stood stiffly on the spot.</p>

    <p>The Tsun clan was the tribal chief clan of the Forest's Edge. They had been on bad terms with the Wu clan since times of old. People had been saying for a long time now that the Tsun and the Wu clan would clash in a battle to extinction sooner or later.</p>

    <p>「Why are the people from the Tsun clan loitering here…? Your village is in the northern end of the settlement, correct…?」</p>

    <p>「Yes, I’m troubled by this too.」</p>

    <p>The woman who called herself Yamiel Tsun raised the corners of her lips slightly.</p>

    <p>「However, it’s fortunate that I met you. This might be the guidance of the forest.」</p>

    <p>「… What business do you have with me…?」</p>

    <p>Vena Wu pretended to be calm, but she was very shaken inside.</p>

    <p>All the Wu clan men were in the forest; even if she ran home, there were only women in her village. The man before her might look lifeless, but a woman couldn’t match him.</p>

    <p>Forest's Edge did not permit anyone to harm others without any reason. However, when Vena Wu was born, people from the Tsun clan abducted a woman from the Mufa house who was going to marry into the Wu clan and murdered her. There wasn’t any clear-cut evidence, but since that incident, the two clans became sworn enemies. If the two of them killed Vena Wu, the Wu clan would demand the Tsun clan to pay back in blood.</p>

    <p>「It’s not a big matter. Do you know Diru Dai?」</p>

    <p>「… Diru Dai…?」</p>

    <p>「Yes, Diru Dai. He is a troubling man. He hails from a minor house, but wishes to woo me.」</p>

    <p>Did this venomous snake-like women win Diru Dai over? Vena Wu was shocked.</p>

    <p>「That man accompanied his house head to the house head conference and fell for me at the first sight when he visited the Tsun clan village. To fall for the eldest daughter of the Tsun clan main house, what is he thinking?」</p>

    <p>「… What’s so strange about that…? Just let him marry into the Tsun clan, and the matters would be solved…」</p>

    <p>「How can a minor house Dai become a kin of the Tsun clan? Their members are few, and they are located far away; it’s impossible for us to acknowledge them… Besides, the Dai house is close to the Wu clan village, who knows when they would betray us.」</p>

    <p>Yamiel Tsun smiled viciously at this point.</p>

    <p>「I won’t accept his marriage proposal. Even if everyone agrees, the former clan head of the Tsun clan won’t give his approval.」</p>

    <p>「… The former head of the Tsun clan…?」</p>

    <p>「Anyway, because of the troubles Diru Dai caused me, I advised him to not come near the Tsun clan ever again… But then, I heard him mention your name.」</p>

    <p>That man actually mentioned Vena Wu’s name to this woman.</p>

    <p>Vena Wu felt annoyed from the bottom of her heart.</p>

    <p>「I’m glad that man fell for another girl… but will you marry him? It’s unlikely for the eldest daughter of the Wu clan main house to marry into a minor house like the Dai house, right?」</p>

    <p>「I won’t marry over or take him into the clan… I have no plans of making that man my spouse…」</p>

    <p>「Really?」</p>

    <p>Yamiel Tsun narrowed her eyes.</p>

    <p>Her eyes were like those of a venomous snake who had her sight on her prey.</p>

    <p>「You don’t have to be concerned about me. I came all this way to break off all ties with that man.」</p>

    <p>「I’m not being concerned about you…」</p>

    <p>Did this matter make Yamiel Tsun feel ill will towards Vena Wu?</p>

    <p>Yamiel Tsun was troubled by a man who kept wooing her, and when she made the effort to warn him against making any more advances, she realized that man had already fallen for another girl. It was hard for Vena Wu to imagine, but if Yamiel Tsun was a prideful person, she might be infuriated by this.</p>

    <p>「… I see. If that is the truth, you made a wise choice. If you marry that man who is all talk, you will end up in misfortune.」</p>

    <p>「…」</p>

    <p>「You don’t need to worry about that man anymore. Diru Dai will be wed to a woman from the Dai branch house.」</p>

    <p>「Huh…? How sudden…」</p>

    <p>「That’s right. It was decided just now.」</p>

    <p>Yamiel Tsun giggled.</p>

    <p>「I ordered him to do so. He has a frivolous nature and might appear before us again one day. Do stop him from doing so; I requested for him to get married to a woman from their branch house.」</p>

    <p>While Vena Wu was still stunned, Yamiel Tsun walked towards her.</p>

    <p>Yamiel Tsun’s glossy red lips breathed out warmly and said venomously:</p>

    <p>「Think about it; that man proposed to both the Tsun clan and the Wu clan at the same time. No matter what his intentions were, if we permit his frivolous actions, the Tsun and Wu clan might shed blood in a Clash of Clans. I’m doing this to stop this possibility at the roots.」</p>

    <p>「… You are forcing him to marry for something like this…?」</p>

    <p>「Ahh, a war between the Tsun and the Wu clans is a serious matter though? If that really happens, the Forest's Edge settlement would be destroyed.」</p>

    <p>They were so close that their cheeks were almost touching. Yamiel Tsun showed a venomous snake-like smile.</p>

    <p>「I had to do this for the sake of saving Forest's Edge. It would be retarded for that man to cause the destruction of Forest's Edge.」</p>

    <p>「… You are a really scary woman…」</p>

    <p>Yamiel Tsun was still smiling viciously as she moved away from Vena Wu.</p>

    <p>「Anyway, this matter is resolved. If you still yearn for that man, it’s regrettable, but I suggest you find a better partner.」</p>

    <p>And so, Yamiel Tsun and the strange follower named Tay Tsun turned and left.</p>

    <p>Vena Wu returned to the Wu clan village and sighed heavily.</p>

    <p>Could it be… that girl named Yamiel Tsun wants to escape from the Forest's Edge settlement too…?</p>

    <p>Both she and Vena Wu held expectations for Diru Dai but were betrayed… Vena Wu couldn’t help thinking that way. If not for that, Vena Wu didn’t think she would treat Diru Dai so cruelly.</p>

    <p>Never mind, compared to Yamiel Tsun and me, he will have a happier life with another woman…</p>

    <p>Vena Wu had no intentions of belittling herself, but she couldn’t help feeling that way.</p>

    <p>At the very least, she did harbor thoughts that went against the rules of Forest's Edge. She didn’t have the courage to realize this thought, but just having this thinking was enough to make her an infidel and betrayer.</p>

    <p>It would be best for Diru Dai to marry a woman without such thoughts and live a peaceful and happy life. According to Vena Wu’s observation, a weak person like him couldn’t become the spouse of Yamiel Tsun or herself. It had nothing to do with their difference in status; he just lacked the capacity to match them. That was why Yamiel Tsun turned down his proposal.</p>

    <p>That’s right… Yamiel Tsun and I are too strange… It is Diru Dai’s misfortune to fall for women like us…</p>

    <p>Diru Dai will live on properly as a denizen of Forest's Edge in the future. Although seeing him spend the rest of his life with a partner he had no feelings for made Vena Wu sympathetic, but he could finally be released from the vicious cycle. What he gained would definitely be more than what he lost.</p>

    <p>What kind of fate awaits me…? As a denizen of Forest's Edge, can I accompany my precious family properly until the very end…?</p>

    <p>Vena Wu was young and couldn’t imagine that at all.</p>

    <p>She would meet Asuta and Shumimaru five years later… and she would spend even longer time to decide her feelings.</p>

    <p>With no idea what kind of the future awaited, Vena Wu hurried home to her precious family.</p>
