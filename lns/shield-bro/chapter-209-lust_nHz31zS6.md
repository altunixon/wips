Lust <br/>
 <br/>
"Victory-!" <br/>
 <br/>
Firo still won't stop doing the victory dance. Does she like competitions? Melty and the others are still groggy and suffering. <br/>
 <br/>
"Well then...the winner gets to take one firo rial from the loser, was it?" (Naofumi) <br/>
 <br/>
I don't really need it, but that's how it's been decided. Umm, looking carefully, these three seem to have their own characteristics. <br/>
 <br/>
The red one with a short bob hairstyle gives a strong-willed impression from their eyes. The blue one with long hair gives a tidy young lady impression. The green one with braided hair seems like a docile, plain class representative type, I'd say similar Rishia. <br/>
 <br/>
Firo is like that so I won't judge to what's inside, but the green one looks easiest to use. <br/>
 <br/>
"Okay, then send over that quiet-looking emerald green one" (Naofumi) <br/>
"No gooooooood! Green is no goooooood!" (Motoyasu) <br/>
 <br/>
Motoyasu protectingly clung to the three of them. Is Midori it's name? I have no duty to say it, but what terrible naming sense. It's very likely that the other two have been named by their colors as well. <br/>
 <br/>
"Really you..." (Naofumi) <br/>
 <br/>
Bringing up the match yourself and declining when you lose, what's with that. I don't really need you speaking your mind. I have a surplus with even Firo. I don't need just another two. <br/>
 <br/>
"Mo-kun!" <br/>
"Mo-chan!" <br/>
"Motoyasu-san!" <br/>
 <br/>
Call him the same way! Is what I will leave unsaid. It'd probably get noisy. The three clung to Motoyasu and were all crying together. Reluctant to part huh? I don't need this. <br/>
 <br/>
"It's fine already, just come back. Don't cause trouble. Follow the filo rial queen's instructions" (Naofumi) <br/>
 <br/>
Good, mission complete. Firo will quiet down too. <br/>
 <br/>
"Father-in-law!" (Motoyasu) <br/>
"Stop calling me that!" (Naofumi) <br/>
 <br/>
Honestly, you just keep getting broken. <br/>
 <br/>
"Please give me your daughter" (Motoyasu) <br/>
"Again!" (Naofumi) <br/>
 <br/>
Ah really...so troublesome. Or rather, to ask for more even when you lose the match huh. <br/>
 <br/>
"Uu...the bad feeling has finally been cured" <br/>
"I've found the spot that works for motion sickness" (Atla) <br/>
 <br/>
Before I realized, Atla was looking after Melty and Rishia. Recovery seems fast. <br/>
 <br/>
"""Mu-...""" <br/>
 <br/>
Motoyasu's followers are saying the same thing as Firo. They are identical on the inside after all. <br/>
 <br/>
"No-! Go home if you lost!" (Firo) <br/>
 <br/>
Firo declared loudly. As a matter of fact that's how it is. It'll take work to apprehend her, and Gaelion is not here so I don't want to get involved. Let's hurry back. <br/>
 <br/>
"Reach Firo-chan! My feelings!" (Motoyasu) <br/>
 <br/>
Motoyasu suddenly wielded his spear and took a pose. What? I didn't get a good look at that flag-attached spear, but the handle is black. Somehow...smells like the Curse Series. <br/>
 <br/>
"Temptation!" (Motoyasu) <br/>
 <br/>
It felt like something like a barrier was developing in the middle of Motoyasu. <br/>
 <br/>
"Wha-" (Naofumi) <br/>
 <br/>
What's this guy doing. A really disturbing word is floating into mind. There are many skills with this name that usually have charm-type effects. I concentrated my eyes and look at Motoyasu. <br/>
 <br/>
Huh? What? Motoyasu has become good-looking. There're glittering sparkles around him like a lame cloth and the background is dyed pink. <br/>
 <br/>
No way...such a hottie...if he's this good-looking even I'll fall for him.... <br/>
 <br/>
"...Yeah right!" (Naofumi) <br/>
 <br/>
I maintain my sense by swinging my head. That was dangerous. I almost got to the point of no recovery. <br/>
 <br/>
"Are you okay!?" (Naofumi) <br/>
 <br/>
I look toward Melty and the others. <br/>
 <br/>
"Ah, yeah. I'm alright...I just thought that person looked a bit cool but I'm okay" (Melty) <br/>
"Fuee...I have Itsuki-sama so it's no good..." (Rishia) <br/>
"What do you mean?" (Atla) <br/>
 <br/>
Atla...was there no effect because she can't see? <br/>
 <br/>
"Naofumi-sama is the only one for me no matter what" (Atla) <br/>
"I see" (Naofumi) <br/>
 <br/>
Anyways, Motoyasu...what are you doing all of a sudden. <br/>
 <br/>
"Hey you-...what's that spear?" (Naofumi) <br/>
"It is L*st Spear IV. Father-in-law" (Motoyasu) <br/>
 <br/>
IV! Higher than Wrath!? Just how sick have you gotten. Or rather, answering so easily is a bad disposition! Last...it's not last. It's lust, no doubt. Why did he answer so honestly I wonder. <br/>
 <br/>
"Father-in-law. If Firo-tan desires it, please allow our engagement" (Motoyasu) <br/>
"Don't you just want to brainwash Firo with your temptation skill?" (Naofumi) <br/>
"It's different! It's a skill my heart summoned to convey my [love] to Firo-tan!" (Motoyasu) <br/>
"Other females have been tempted too. Even males were affected" (Naofumi) <br/>
 <br/>
What are you learning a brainwashing skill for. Even though I wanted to know about the existence of a brainwashing shield so much, why are you using it. Because Motoyasu before he got broken was loud saying brainwash brainwash. <br/>
 <br/>
"I don't need any love besides Firo-tan's" (Motoyasu) <br/>
"I see" (Naofumi) <br/>
 <br/>
But to think his lust for Firo exceeds my anger.... <br/>
Wow. Losing is fine already. I want to return. Speaking of...Firo is being quiet. <br/>
 <br/>
"Firo?" (Naofumi) <br/>
"Haa...haa...n..." (Firo) <br/>
 <br/>
This rough breathing, it's come huh. Motoyasu's dearest desire. It's over, I wonder if I should give up. Should I have Atla return her to normal? In  RPGs of the past, charm and confusion could be offset by an attack from an ally. Though sometimes it wouldn't work. <br/>
 <br/>
"Okay Atla, hit Firo" (Naofumi) <br/>
"Yes!" (Atla) <br/>
 <br/>
Atla hit around Firo's flank. However.... <br/>
 <br/>
"Haa...haa..." (Firo) <br/>
 <br/>
She won't return. <br/>
 <br/>
"Firo-chan?" (Atla) <br/>
 <br/>
Ah, she won't come back. Is it impossible to help Firo without defeating Motoyasu? <br/>
 <br/>
"Firo-tan! I am over here!" (Motoyasu) <br/>
"""Muuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuu!""" <br/>
 <br/>
Leaving behind the three burning with jealousy, Motoyasu opened his arms widely waiting for Firo. Tempting the other with the spear's power is love? However...Motoyasu's plan is-- <br/>
 <br/>
"--aster. Want to eat" (Firo) <br/>
 <br/>
Heading in another direction, the box that must not be opened was opened. Of all things, Firo turned to face me and started walking plumpily. <br/>
 <br/>
"Haa...haa..." (Firo) <br/>
 <br/>
Her eyes look more dangerous than this morning. A chill ran down my spine. What is this. My instincts are sounding the danger alarm. The goosebumps and chills won't stop. It'll be bad if I don't stand and leave here immediately! <br/>
 <br/>
"Portal Shield!" (Naofumi) <br/>
 <br/>
I keep relying on this but it can't be helped. I won't get away if I don't rely on it. But.... <br/>
 <br/>
Transfer failed!? Because of Motoyasu's skill huh. <br/>
 <br/>
"I won't let you escape..." (Firo) <br/>
 <br/>
Looking closely...something like a mist is enshrouding Firo, with firefly-like lights floating around nearby. <br/>
 <br/>
"...Sanctuary..." (Firo) <br/>
 <br/>
Firo lightly chanted a magic. It's probably the same system of magic as Gaelion's Dragon Sanctuary without doubt I think. <br/>
 <br/>
Dragon Pulse? <br/>
 <br/>
No, firo rials would not use it. But the atmosphere and area resemble the time when Fitoria appeared. Why can Firo use it. <br/>
 <br/>
Tell me how you were able to use it before me who's relying on Gaelion! No, there's no mistake...it's useful because of the current circumstances. <br/>
 <br/>
"Fi, Fitoria! Repay me now and send it!" (Naofumi) <br/>
 <br/>
Whether or not I was heard, Firo's ahoge is shining. But it had no effect, and something black was silently coiling about around the ahoge. <br/>
 <br/>
"Naofumi-sama!" (Atla) <br/>
 <br/>
Atla stood in front of Firo. <br/>
 <br/>
"Move" (Firo) <br/>
 <br/>
Firo nimbly held Atla's shoulder and moved her aside. <br/>
 <br/>
"Ah--" (Atla) <br/>
 <br/>
How fast. Even though Atla's movements were good too. Well, being compared to Firo is unfair. She's the fastest of my subordinates after all, this fellow. <br/>
 <br/>
"Atla, do you know what's happening to Firo?" (Naofumi) <br/>
"Yes! Something black came out from that person and is coiling around Firo-chan" (Atla) <br/>
 <br/>
Then, Atla pointed at Motoyasu.
