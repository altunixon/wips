Hi everybody. Here is the 34th chapter of Ouroboros Record. This time, Olcivv did the translation while I edited and checked for accuracy. <br/>
 I know I promised a chapter a month but due to studies, I haven't really did much translations. To be honest, they are mostly excuses and I might be able to ooze out a bit more from myself but I guess just didn't. And it seems much harder to get started once I was away for some period of time. In any case, I still plan to get 1 chapter per month out. Also I will definitely be late for the november release as I have final exams coming next week and very early December, so I foresee the next release to be mid December.<br/>
