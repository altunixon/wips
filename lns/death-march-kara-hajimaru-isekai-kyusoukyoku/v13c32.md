13-32. Demon Lord Shin (2)<br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
Satou's here. There are various upstarts in stories, but in case of evil characters betraying their friends, I feel that there are many cases where miserable fate wait for them after their rise in power.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
◇<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Now then, how do I take off the Demon Lord Orb's influence from Shin boy?<br/>
While I'm thinking that in my mind, a fool comes intruding in.<br/>
<br/>
"Your highness, I've come to save you with my followers zamasu!"<br/>
<br/>
Smashing through the sub-space's wall, the green demon in green dragon form and mid and lower demons in various forms surge forward.<br/>
Looking at the mid demon with drill arms, that one probably has the ability to break through barrier.<br/>
<br/>
"G-good work--"<br/>
<br/>
Shin boy was going to say something, but that voice was erased by the thunderous roar of my advanced magic [Photon Laser] purging the demons.<br/>
<br/>
As expected of an advanced magic.<br/>
The demons pleasantly pop off.<br/>
It's a bit too noisy, and the surrounding temperature increases greatly, but I guess it can't be helped with this firepower.<br/>
<br/>
Only one mid demon that has Light Resistance skill remains, but I quickly exterminate it with a single magic-power-overloaded Holy Bolt.<br/>
<br/>
"Gugaaagagaga"<br/>
<br/>
I thought that the excessive one-sided battle had a bad influence on Shin boy's mental, so I turn toward him in a hurry--<br/>
<br/>
"Usurpation zamasu. With the power to rule over magic, me can be a demon lord too zamasu!" <br/>
<TLN: That 'me' is in the raw.><br/>
<br/>
I saw the green demon possessing Shin boy just for an instant.<br/>
Shin boy's state becomes [Posessed]. He was easily posessed even though he's a demon lord, I wonder if it's because of the difference in levels?<br/>
<br/>
Still, a falling out between friends huh.... In a sense, it's very like demons.<br/>
<br/>
Oops, it'll be too late if I'm too carefree.<br/>
I have to do something.<br/>
<br/>
It'll be simple if I use the forbidden spell of light magic [Divine Exorcism], but I haven't registered that in the Magic Column.<br/>
<br/>
--This is bad.<br/>
<br/>
Shin boy would fuse with the green demon if I chant too long.<br/>
<br/>
--It was in a POP-ed treasure chest.<br/>
<br/>
Suddenly, Arisa's voice floated in my mind.<br/>
<br/>
"That's right! I have that."<br/>
<br/>
While unintentionally talking to myself, I take out the [Magic Sealing Bell] from the Storage and ring it.<br/>
Ding, the calm sound of the bell spreads in the air like a ripple.<br/>
<br/>
ＺＷＡＡＡＭＭＭＭＡＡＳＷＵＵＵＵＵＵＵ.<br/>
<br/>
While letting out a loud scream, the green demon who had merged with Shin boy comes off him.<br/>
I get close to it with Ground Shrink, catch the semi-transparent ethereal body of the green demon, and tear it off Shin boy completely.<br/>
<br/>
I cut the demon into pieces with a holy sword while it's still in the air.<br/>
Just before the green demon disappears, I track the magic essence line that connects the green demon's avatar to its main body.<br/>
Judging from its behavior, the green demon's avatar should not be a stand-alone but a remote-controlled one.<br/>
<br/>
Feeling like trying to find a sinking fishing line in a vast ocean, I extend the magic essence detection.<br/>
<br/>
--Found it!<br/>
<br/>
The next moment, I spring out in the base of the green demon beyond.<br/>
I don't know myself how I moved here.<br/>
<br/>
Is it magic or skill--I'll think about it later.<br/>
<br/>
I stitch the main body of the green demon who's zamasuzamasu-ing with the space magic [<<Dimension Pile>>] so that it can't escape, and finish it off with a holy sword.<br/>
<br/>
Oops, I can't let my guard down here.<br/>
This kind of guy won't be completely annihilated with just this much.<br/>
<br/>
I use [All Map Exploration] magic after a long while and investigate this area thoroughly.<br/>
<br/>
I thought it'd be an area without map, but it turned out to be [Rotted Abyss Labyrinth: Remains].<br/>
Apparently, this is one of the withered labyrinths.<br/>
<br/>
I found a red dot in the area.<br/>
It seems to be a split body of the green demon that has possessed a rat.<br/>
<br/>
Good grief, just how hard to die are these demon guys.<br/>
<br/>
Since there won't be any victim in a withered labyrinth anyway, I use the [Photon Laser] from earlier once again, completely annihilating the last fragment of the green demon through the labyrinth wall.<br/>
With this, I don't have to worry about the zamasu zamasu and the green demon again.<br/>
<br/>
Auto Loot of the booty begins, my Log is flowing at great speed.<br/>
Sorting the room that's full of junks, there are only several green colored globes that remain in the corner of the room.<br/>
<br/>
--What's that?<br/>
<br/>
I go closer to them and the AR reading tells me what they are.<br/>
<br/>
Apparently, they're specimens the green demon had used to make its mock bodies (avatars).<br/>
The green globe breaks when I touch it with my hand, and the creature inside shows itself.<br/>
<br/>
--ＫＹＥＷＷＲＯＵＵＵＮ.<br/>
<br/>
The green infant dragon tilts its head.<br/>
Unlike the green demon's mock body, it's really adorable.<br/>
<br/>
While feeding the truck-sized infant dragon with some whale meat, I open a space magic's [Gate] and let it out of here.<br/>
After the infant dragon, I also help the other mythical beasts and animals from the globes and let them out of here.<br/>
Sorry for the discrimination, but I exterminate the ones that are monsters like wyverns quickly.<br/>
<br/>
The problem is the humans.<br/>
<br/>
For now, after helping them out of the globes, I make them sleep with water magic's [Anesthetic Sleep], and then send them to Echigoya Firm with Unit Arrangement.<br/>
I've ordered one of the executive girls to take care of them, so leaving them should be fine.<br/>
<br/>
Of course I send people who have felony on their Reward and Punishments to the Royal Capital's prison with Unit Arrangement.<br/>
This isn't the first time I sent people there forcibly, and the wardens there are flexible, so there's no doubt that they'll be taken care of properly.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
◇<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
I come back to the sub-space where I left Shin boy behind.<br/>
<br/>
Even though he's in critical condition, the demon lord's life force ties him to the living.<br/>
I thought he'd fine since he's a demon lord, but it seems my estimation is a bit off.<br/>
<br/>
Shin boy would have died if I were to liken him with Wild Boar King and Dog-head.<br/>
<br/>
I stop Shin boy's bleeding with intermediate healing magic.<br/>
It'll be troubling if I completely heal him, I'm thinking of releasing Shin boy's demon lord-fication now.<br/>
<br/>
Perhaps the green demon's fusion earlier affects him adversely, violet colored aura begins to ooze out of Shin boy's body.<br/>
I try to extend my hand once again, but my hand really does pass through the violet aura.<br/>
<br/>
I take out the Divine Sword from the Storage, and touch it on the violet aura.<br/>
The aura is sucked at the point where the Divine Sword touches it, while the surrounding aura is scattered like oil spilled on water.<br/>
<br/>
It doesn't seem good, so I quickly put the Divine Sword back into the Storage.<br/>
<br/>
Now then, what should I do....<br/>
<br/>
I can't be too leisurely at this.<br/>
That said, besides the Divine Sword, there's probably nothing that can meddle with the [God's Fragment]--<br/>
<br/>
...no, there's one.<br/>
<br/>
I choose that among the list of item in the Storage.<br/>
I don't like showing my failure, but I can't say that either.<br/>
<br/>
I push out the jet black lump toward the violet aura, it feels like touching a thin vinyil membrane.<br/>
<br/>
--I can do it.<br/>
<br/>
Moving like I'm making a cotton candy, I twine the violet aura using the jet black lump--my black arm that I had to cut after being taken by divinity.<br/>
<br/>
As expected of Easy Mode.<br/>
Even though I did it myself, I didn't think it'd really work.<br/>
<br/>
Before long, some heavy response came.<br/>
<br/>
While being careful not to sever the thread created by the violet aura, I pull the thread out like I'm fishing, and then a violet light jumps out of Shin boy's chest.<br/>
<br/>
『S-stop with the violence』<br/>
<br/>
The dark violet light grumbles while flickering.<br/>
<br/>
『Geez, just when I was taken out, I got put into some imatture child.』<br/>
<br/>
While swinging left and right, the light grumbles continously.<br/>
<br/>
『Gotta complain to God when I go back』<br/>
<br/>
I don't intend to let it go, so I take out and immediately draw the Divine Sword from the Storage, cutting the [God's Fragment].<br/>
<br/>
Like before, the dark violet light is sucked to the Divine Sword.<br/>
Now then, the fragment's disposal is over with this.<br/>
<br/>
I put the Divine Sword back into the storage, and then heal Shin boy who's bloodied all over because the dark violet light jumped out.<br/>
His two-meter big figure of man gradually shrinks, returning to his original frail looking boy.<br/>
<br/>
The horn has fallen out and his hair and body color have also returned, but it seems he doesn't completely turn back into his original figure.<br/>
His forelock and sideburns are still in violet color among his white hair, his right hand remains in claw shape.<br/>
<br/>
His race has become [Human(Fiend)], and his state is [Miasma Poisoning].<br/>
I feel that his race would become Fiend if I left him alone.<br/>
<br/>
His title has also changed to [Fallen Hero], and hidden titles [Former Demon Lord], and [Half Demon] have appeared.<br/>
His Unique Skill is gone, and his level falls to 20 from 50, but it's still higher than his original level.<br/>
[Composite Magic], [Magic Knowledge], [Magic Resistance: Composite] have also appeared on his skill column. They're some quite enviable skills.<br/>
The last one in particular, I want our girls to have it.<br/>
<br/>
Shin boy groans painfully.<br/>
His eyes opened for an instant, one of it was red, the other was violet.<br/>
It's probablyl an influence from [Miasma Poisoning].<br/>
<br/>
I have to do something fast....<br/>
<br/>
I have a hunch that the [Miasma Poisoning] can be healed if I make him drink the Nectar, but I'm afraid that he'll turn into some godlike High Human being.<br/>
<br/>
While thinking like that, the [Miasma Poisoning] is cured when I use the earth-elemental abnormal status recovery magic.<br/>
<br/>
"Easier to do something than worrying about it huh--hm?"<br/>
<br/>
Shin boy's state jumps into my view who feels anticlimatic.<br/>
The [Miasma Poisoning] that should have been cured reappears.<br/>
<br/>
While feeling puzzled, I tried using abnormal status recovery magic from water, light, and other elements, but the result was the same.<br/>
Once it's been cured, it reapppears again if I wait for a bit.<br/>
Moreover, everytime I cure him, Shin boy's condition becomes worse, a condition called [Weakening] is even added to his state now.<br/>
<br/>
Perhaps he can't be cured unless it's temple type recovery magic.<br/>
Although, if I bring Shin boy in his state right now there, they'll likely eliminate him without question.<br/>
<br/>
Hikaru uses force magic, so she should be not that different from me, as for other people....<br/>
After thinking that far, I remember a person of exceptional talent.<br/>
