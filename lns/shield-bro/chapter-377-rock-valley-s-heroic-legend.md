He was much yearned for by the opposite sex, and it’s said that he had many descendants.<br/>
He was famed for both his business and cooking ability. The merchants who personally dealt with him created enterprises great enough that even now, their names are all around us.<br/>
Because of that, he became worshiped as the God of the Shield, presiding over business and culinary arts.<br/>
Rock Valley was the country he restored, and it’s said that it was named in the tongue of his origin.<br/>
It’s said that in the naming of Rock Valley, someone offered the following opinion:<br/>
"Oy, while you can see cliffs here by the sea, there’s no valley…"<br/>
It is unknown who voiced these words.<br/>
