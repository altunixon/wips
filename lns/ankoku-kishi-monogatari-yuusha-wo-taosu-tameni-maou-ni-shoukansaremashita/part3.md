Chapter 53.3 : Demon King and Goddess<br/>
The army under Modes’s direct supervision was far more powerful compared to the combined armies of the other kingdoms.<br/>
The Order of Dark Knights was composed of the higher species of the Demon Race, the Daemon, while the army of eight generals was composed of the lower ranks of the Demon race.<br/>
 <br/>
The Order of Dark Knights was led by four knights who were renowned as the Four Heavenly Kings.<br/>
And the ones who led the armies composed of lower-ranking demon races were the generals who came from various races, known as the Eight Demon Generals.<br/>
 <br/>
Putina was one of those Eight Demon Generals.<br/>
 <br/>
Originally, the general of the Beast army was her mother but she perished in battle against Reiji. Putina replaced her mother as the general.<br/>
 <br/>
「The thing is, I wanted to express my gratitude to Your Excellency for the sweets.」<br/>
「Ah, that matter, huh? Please don’t mind it, General Putina. That’s also the expression of my gratitude to you.」<br/>
 <br/>
Putina was the one who gave me the Queen Salmon and honey when I was looking for food for Regena and the others.<br/>
Thanks to that, I secured the meal for Regena and her relatives.<br/>
 <br/>
After Regena and her relatives had gone to Shirone’s place, I made some sweets with the leftover honey and gave it to Putina, to express my gratitude. It seemed that Putina wanted to thank me for the sweets.<br/>
 <br/>
「Would you make it for me again if I give you the honey, Your Excellency? 」<br/>
「Of course, General Putina.」<br/>
「YA~Y!! Thank you very much, Your Excellency!!」<br/>
 <br/>
Putina embraced me as she yelled so with a delighted voice.<br/>
I caressed Putina’s head.<br/>
 <br/>
I didn’t know her real age since she was a werebear.<br/>
 <br/>
Putina looked very much like a human girl at the moment. When she asked me for sweets, her appearance was that of an innocent [loli]girl.<br/>
 <br/>
So cute.<br/>
 <br/>
Thanks to the sweets I assumed I had one less enemy to worry about.<br/>
The lower ranks of the demon race didn’t have much hostility towards me. Or rather, they feared the Daemon race, the high ranking one.<br/>
That might be the reason why they easily opened up to me when I treated them kindly.<br/>
 <br/>
「Oh, right!! Can I go with you too when you make the sweets? Let me help Your Excellency!! 」<br/>
 <br/>
Putina smiled at me.<br/>
 <br/>
「Is it really okay? You’re a General of the Demon King’s Army. Will it become a problem if you leave your post? 」<br/>
 <br/>
Despite her position, she ranked lower than the Four Heavenly Kings, such as Runfeld. It would be bad if she left Nargol.<br/>
 <br/>
「Well… I guess I can’t, then. Let’s not be so formal to each other.」<br/>
 <br/>
Putina smiled again.<br/>
But I really couldn’t let her come along since she didn’t have permission to leave her post.<br/>
As I was pondering the best way to reject her request, I sensed someone approaching us.<br/>
 <br/>
「Please wait, General Putina. Your Excellency is troubled by your request to come along.」<br/>
 <br/>
It was a female Dark Elf.<br/>
I couldn’t find a safe area to look at her since she wore a black bikini armor.<br/>
She was the General of the Ghost Army, Shirley. She was one of the Eight Demon Generals from the Dark Elf race.<br/>
 <br/>
Dark Elves were born from an elf who fell in love with a Daemon male. The elf woman then chased after her beloved man all the way to Nargol and lived in this place since then, giving birth to a new race.<br/>
It was theorized that the dark indigo color of a Dark Elf’s skin was the influence of the Daemon blood flowing through their veins.<br/>
 <br/>
Since they were originally Elves, they too could manipulate spirits.<br/>
But, according to them, the spirits didn’t cooperate at all when Reiji and the others attacked Nargol. They had been completely useless in the previous battle.<br/>
 <br/>
The spirits probably didn’t attack the intruders because of the presence of a powerful spirit user in Reiji’s party.<br/>
 <br/>
Similar to Putina, Shirley also helped me secure food for Regena and her relatives.<br/>
The Dark Elves were the supervisors of the fruit trees and vegetable gardens of the Demon King. I received tons of vegetables and fruits from Shirley.<br/>
 <br/>
At the time I was so delighted that I cooked some vegetable dishes from what Shirley had brought. I discovered that Dark Elves were very enthusiastic about trying out new dishes.<br/>
We were on good terms thanks to that.<br/>
 <br/>
「Shirley!! Do you realize that you’re obstructing my relationship with His Excellency?!」<br/>
 <br/>
Putina intimidated Shirley after she had separated herself from me. She had an overwhelming advantage in terms of combat experience.<br/>
Shirley’s face cramped after hearing Putina’s threat.<br/>
 <br/>
「I am not, General Putina… We are the Generals of His Majesty’s army. We might receive a severe reminder from Runfeld-sama if we act on our own convenience.」<br/>
 <br/>
Putina stopped her threats as soon as Shirley brought out Runfeld’s name.<br/>
 <br/>
「Uuh… You’re right. Run-sama sure is scary.」<br/>
 <br/>
Putina was getting scared just by thinking about Runfeld. Seeing how scared she was made me sympathize with Runfeld.<br/>
All he did was raise the discipline for the sake of the Demon King’s army. He definitely wasn’t a bad person. He was just scary.<br/>
 <br/>
「Therefore, what do you think about taking our female subordinates, Your Excellency? I think our girls will definitely be useful for Your Excellency’s night activities.」<br/>
 <br/>
Shirley bowed as she said so.<br/>
Why in the world did she emphasize the night activities? I couldn’t help but retort inside.<br/>
But that would mean trouble.<br/>
A General acting on their own was definitely bad, but a General giving in to their subordinates’ demands wasn’t good either.<br/>
Guno and the other female knights would surely make a ruckus over this matter.<br/>
I couldn’t just take His Majesty’s direct subordinate. Things would certainly turn into a quarrel once I took in those Dark Elves.<br/>
The problem lay in how to refuse General Shirley’s offer.<br/>
 <br/>
「Isn’t that an interesting proposal, Your Excellency? 」<br/>
 <br/>
Shirley was already leaning closer to me while I was still pondering about how to reject her offer.<br/>
 <br/>
「WOAH!! General Shirley!! 」<br/>
「Hey, Shirley!! Don’t you realize that you’re troubling His Excellency? 」<br/>
 <br/>
Putina also came closer and embraced me.<br/>
Crap. I was really in a pinch. I wanted to smile when Putina embraced me, but Shirley was scary. Her tits and butt, to be exact.<br/>
 <br/>
 CALM DOWN――! CALM DOWN――! PLEASE CALM DOWN, O FEROCIOUS DRAGON IN ME―!<br/>
I was frantically counting prime numbers in my head: 4, 6, 8, 1—- F#ck, those aren’t prime numbers.<br/>
 <br/>
「Hey, what are you doing here? 」<br/>
 <br/>
Someone called out to us in the middle of this difficult situation.<br/>
 <br/>
「FELTON!! Guede!! 」<br/>
「General Felton!! General Guede!! 」<br/>
 <br/>
Putina and Shirley separated themselves from me as soon as they saw those two approaching us.<br/>
The ones who called us were Heavenly Demon General Felton and Abyss Demon General Guede.<br/>
 <br/>
「It seems you guys were in the middle of flirting, I see. Can you allow me to join too? 」<br/>
 <br/>
Felton smiled at Shirley and Putina as he spoke to them, but his eyes weren’t smiling at all. It seemed like Felton was always like this.<br/>
He never truly smiled from the bottom of his heart, despite always wearing a smile on his face.<br/>
Felton was a male of the Kale race. They were a lower-ranking Demon Race on the same level as the Imp and the Empusa race.<br/>
Two bat-like black giant wings sprouted from his back and two horns from his forehead. Their figure was closer to the depiction of the Devil from Earth.<br/>
Felton was a warrior well versed in magic. He wore a really cool looking vampire-like robe and kept his sword strapped to his waist.<br/>
His subordinates were composed of lower-ranking demons. He was also the leader of the Eight Demon Generals.<br/>
During the battle against Reiji, he went as Runfeld’s second-in-command. He was also the one who carried the heavily wounded Runfeld on his back all the way to the Demon King’s castle.<br/>
 <br/>
During that time, his subordinates were annihilated while trying to hold back Reiji and the others. But thanks to his subordinates’ sacrifice, the Order of Dark Knights escaped destruction.<br/>
Guede, who came along with him, was a former member of the kale race, the General of the Undead.<br/>
He who excelled at Necromancy turned himself into the undead for a better mastery of his own power. His body was shrouded from head to toe and underneath it, there was only a mist-like black shadow.<br/>
Physical attacks didn’t work on him, but the person himself was quite fragile.<br/>
He was the one who led more than 1 million undead, the biggest army amongst the Eight Demon Generals.<br/>
And yet, that army was annihilated by Reiji in a second. Guede himself was almost permanently killed by Reiji if not for Modes using his magic to revive the General.<br/>
Because they were originally from the same race, Guede often moved alongside Felton.<br/>
 <br/>
「General Putina, General Shirley. Don’t you think that your actions are troubling His Excellency? I think it’s better if you step aside when things reach this point.」<br/>
 <br/>
Felton smiled at them.<br/>
 <br/>
「Since His Excellency has his own business, how about I keep you company instead? 」<br/>
 <br/>
Felton was getting closer to Putina and Shirley, which made both of them show an unpleasant expression.<br/>
 <br/>
「Gugugu, I understand. Let’s talk about this matter again later.」<br/>
「…. Likewise, me too.」<br/>
 <br/>
Putina and Shirley went away as if trying to escape from this place.<br/>
Felton always had a scary look on his face. His smile basically empowered his scariness. For this reason, many people ran away from him.<br/>
But when I tried to talk to him, he was surprisingly nice to talk to. It felt like he purposely played the bad guy role to protect the order within the Demon King’s army.<br/>
 <br/>
「Thank you very much, General Felton.」<br/>
 <br/>
I bowed to Felton.<br/>
