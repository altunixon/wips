Arifureta After II   Mistaken World View<br/>
<br/>
At a corner of an island floating in the sky was a demon king sitting on the ground while grasping his knees.<br/>
It was Hajime.<br/>
「Even though thou understood this is how it wouldst end up……」<br/>
A weeping back, eyes that looked like dead fish’s, and a beautiful huddling posture could be seen. Hajime, who was currently the personification of a picture perfect "depressed person", was told such by Tio with an exasperated expression.<br/>
「Guu」<br/>
He could barely let out a ‘guu’ sound. Seeing such a Hajime, Tio snickered once more through her exasperation. The situation that was the exact opposite of their normal actions would surely make anyone who knew these two to doubt their eyes if they saw this. (TN: In Japan, there is a saying of "he cannot even make a ‘guu’ sound" to show how speechless or cornered the person is.)<br/>
「Come on, Goshujin-sama. Come back to thyself quickly. Thou art going to investigate the cause of this island’s floating state, correct?」<br/>
Tio snugly squatted beside Hajime. She peered at Hajime’s face with a consoling smile. Hajime glanced at Tio, and then he glanced across his shoulder to look behind him.<br/>
Over there were several fainted dragons with the white of their eyes completely exposed. Several of their fellow dragons poked at them to ascertain their well-being while several others were staring fearfully at Hajime and Tio. It went without saying that the fainted group was the victim of one of the Demon King-Style 108 Harassment Skills, "Peek-a-Demon King!".<br/>
「Just leave me alone and take care of those guys. You see, I’m disgusted from the bottom of my heart by a foolish existence like me.」<br/>
「Well, certainly, it was really immature.」<br/>
「Gufuh. Getting told that by the likes of a hopeless dragon……depressing. I want to……not die; I want to be a shut-in.」<br/>
「Even though Goshujin-sama’s mind art damaged that much, this natural abuse, nnn-」<br/>
Tio’s cheeks reddened while her body fidgeted.<br/>
A dragon that was poking its comrade behind them tilted its head「Oh?」before a beat later it made a commotion *gyau gyau*. The other dragons got startled and turned around. They then started to make similar noises. A fainted dragon had its tongue spilled out limply from its mouth. ……It seemed that it was just a step short of death’s door.<br/>
「However, for Goshujin-sama to make merry until this far, how rare this is.」<br/>
「Well, I cannot deny that my mood is uplifted more than usual. After all, an adventure where there is no clear objective, no powerful enemy, and no companion’s life at stake like this is a first.」<br/>
「Boy.」<br/>
「You say that, but you too are high spirited, aren’t you?」<br/>
「Yes. I couldst not deny that.」<br/>
One more dragon had its tongue spilled out limply. And then one more dragon, although it opened its eyes just for a moment, then stretched its forelegs to the sky――before losing strength and flopping on the ground.<br/>
This scene was obvious to the trained eye. Right now, something that looked like a white vapor was rising out from the limply unmoving dragons toward the heavens with a swaying motion! They were dying from the shock of "Peek-a-Demon King"!<br/>
「Well, for now, I’ll depend on you to keep my disgrace a secret, okay? As expected, if this is known by Yue and the others, then I’ll turn into a real shut-in from shame and self-disgust.」<br/>
Hajime stood up while making Tio promise to keep this a secret. He then turned on his heels and walked away briskly. He was heading toward the dragons making *gyau gyau* noises at their comrades’ death.<br/>
The surviving dragons were startled by Hajime’s approach, and their bodies froze before they escaped in panic.<br/>
「Fufufuh, a secret just between the two of us, that really art not bad. Very well. The childish figure of Goshujin-sama will be locked inside mine heart.」<br/>
「Please, okay? Now then, you guys, don’t go to the other side as you please.」<br/>
Hajime was talking with Tio while fitting his hand into a black glove that was overflowing with romance. He then suddenly reached out with his hand to the empty air and grasped something violently and then drove it into the dragon below him.<br/>
The dragon with its tongue lolling out twitched and convulsed. The other dragons raised their cries while evacuating to the sky, as though to say「He is beating up a corpse!?」<br/>
Not paying any attention to that, Hajime did the same thing to the other dragons. He caught something midair and then drove that something, with a palm strike, into the dragons’ bodies.<br/>
「Still, looking at them from nearby like this I can really see it……these dragons, their bodies are really frail.」<br/>
「Yes. They art scared of humans, and then with the polluted land there art no doubt that this world is a harsh place without sufficient food for these children to live.」<br/>
While conversing like that, Hajime made red sparks run through the black glove. *bachi bachi* With that sound, the hand became clad in moderate electricity before Hajime’s hand casually struck at the place where the heart of the dragon with the lolling tongue seemed to be located at while still talking normally with Tio.<br/>
The dragon with the lolling tongue twitched and trembled. Then in the next moment, its eyes opened with a snap, and it accomplished its revival!<br/>
The "Lightning Clad" seemed to be overflowing with casualness, but actually, it had been superbly adjusted. Hajime also used electric shock into the dragons that were ascending to heaven.<br/>
By the way, Hajime reaching out his hand into the empty air was a direct blow to the soul――by using the black glove that was a protection artifact, Hajime grasped the souls of the dragons that were ascending to heaven and returned them to their bodies.<br/>
The dragons that received the relatively rough direct resurrection treatment were shivering in terror, as expected when they saw Hajime. Hajime muttered「Well, can’t be helped. I reap what I sow」. For the time being, he took out food――meat that was preserved inside "Treasure Warehouse II" ――for the bean sprout dragons.<br/>
Hajime threw it carelessly at the dragons’ feet. The dragons jumped in place because they couldn’t escape even if they wanted to with their distance being so close to Hajime, but even so, their nose was twitching from the wafting smell from below.<br/>
They were bothered by Hajime. Or rather, they were scared. Perhaps they would be killed instantly the moment they took their eyes off of him……<br/>
Even while thinking that, drool was already flowing like a river from their mouths. In less than ten seconds their eyes were already glancing repeatedly at their feet.<br/>
They looked like a doggy that was told to "wait" .<br/>
Hajime smiled wryly.<br/>
「That’s an apology for surprising you guys. You guys looking like bean sprouts even though you are of the dragon race is also pitiful. Eat as much as you want.」<br/>
Hajime also carelessly left behind more raw meat in order to include the share of the dragons that were circling above while observing the situation. And then he drew back.<br/>
The dragons looked at each other. ‘He is not attacking? What is this thing with a good smell? Is it okay to eat?’ It felt like those voices of the heart could be heard from them.<br/>
The flying dragons hesitantly landed down. Their eyes were turning bloodshot from seeing the lumps of meat while drool was flowing from their mouth like a waterfall. The dragons looked at each other, and then they glanced at Hajime.<br/>
Hajime was standing silently beside Tio. Beside the mysteriously kind and great existence who was clad in the same presence as them.<br/>
Before long, one dragon became unable to endure anymore and bit at the edge of the meat. While the other dragons were watching over him「O, oi. Are you okay?」, for a moment, the dragon stiffened before its eyes suddenly snapped open and it charged the lump of meat.<br/>
「GYUUOOOOWAAAAA!」<br/>
Anyone could understand its meaning despite it not using words. That was truly a roar of joy! ‘How can something this delicious exist in this world! This is like a treasure among food~~-!!’ Such a voice from the heart was resounding.<br/>
Naturally, the other dragons also snapped at the meat. And then they raised similar roars of joy.<br/>
One dragon exposed the white of its eyes, and its tongue lolled out from the excessive deliciousness and excitement. Its soul that looked like a white vapor was ascending to heaven. Hajime quickly grasped it, drove it *zudon-* into the body, and revived it with *bachi bachi*. The dragon then snapped into the meat once more.<br/>
「These guys, they are dying too easily. Just how frail are they?」<br/>
「Truly, this art too pitiful for a dragon race……was what I wanted to say, but it looks like this art even the first time eating meat for these children. Most likely, they art surviving by living on this island and eating fruits or something else. By the way, why did Goshujin-sama bring meat like that?」<br/>
「Aa. Remember, we had a barbecue before, right? A lot of people came, and so I bought a lot of meat in preparation for high spirits. These are the remains of that time.」<br/>
「Mu. Wait a second, Goshujin-sama. If I remember correctly, the meat at that time was really good meat correct? I remember that it was the brand product from somewhere.」<br/>
「Yeah. These are grade A5 meats.」<br/>
「……The meat they art eating for the first time, art the top quality product. Perhaps it couldst not be helped if they ascend to heaven from that.」<br/>
Rather, this was an act that would make the meat producer fly into a rage saying ‘don’t use this meat for animal food!’. If Hajime was going to make an excuse, then it was because other than this meat he only had preserved food. Even Hajime felt a bit regretful doing this.<br/>
But, this act, that was an extravagance in a sense, brought an unexpected result about.<br/>
「Hm? ……Their wariness is lessening slightly?」<br/>
Yes, the dragons that were giving off satisfied auras as though to say「I’m full!」were sending glances at Hajime. From those gazes, it certainly looked like the color of terror from before was lessening. Right now, he had to say they were more bewildered than scared.<br/>
「……Are we mistaken perhaps? Who would have thought that these guys who were that scared of humans would change their hearts like this just from a single helping of food.」<br/>
「Muu. These children art too simple that it’s worrisome. They are like children who wouldst follow a stranger just because they are promised candy.」<br/>
It was unthinkable for a wild beast to so easily let go of the wariness they had harbored once. That was why Hajime gave them meat in the name of apologizing, but……at this rate, perhaps these dragons would react warmly towards humans who they actually ought to be wary against when compared to from before.<br/>
The result of doing that would be the same as shortening the life of these dragons. Therefore, Hajime’s expression turned a bit bitter.<br/>
「But if you look at it from another angle, then perhaps they are so cornered to the degree that their wariness will lessen just from a single helping of food……」<br/>
Hajime sighed. And then, he exposed a really speechless expression before he suddenly changed his presence.<br/>
「Sorry. I didn’t intend to toy with you guys, but……I did something bad. Be scared of humans properly.」<br/>
Saying that, Hajime was about to emit "Pressure"――but it was at that time,<br/>
「「「「「Gyauh!?」」」」」<br/>
The dragons suddenly turned around in a panic and rushed at full speed into the forest.<br/>
「Goshujin-sama?」<br/>
「No, that’s not me. I haven’t emitted "Pressure". Just what in the――」<br/>
Tio showed a face that was questioning Hajime, but naturally, Hajime responded with words of denial. Hajime himself was tilting his head in puzzlement as to why the dragons suddenly ran away.<br/>
But, in the next moment, he noticed the cause and stopped his words. If it was the hell rabbit-eared Shia, then it would’ve been possible that she would’ve noticed at the same time as, or possibly faster than, the dragons.<br/>
「What? Something is approaching? A living thing……but this voice…」<br/>
「Mu? I couldst not hear anything……no, now I couldst. ……This is…..it sounds like a motor?」<br/>
「Ye, yeah. I can also hear something like that……」<br/>
From far away the sound of *kiiiiiiiii-* was faintly resounding. Certainly, it was just as Tio said; the sound resembled that of a motor. Yes, it was a voice that was raised by a machine. Therefore, Hajime couldn’t hide his bewilderment.<br/>
A black rain that polluted the world, dragons, and a floating island in the sky. In this undoubtedly fantasy world, something that was making a sound that resembled a motor was approaching rapidly. It couldn’t be helped that his image of this world was crumbling.<br/>
「Nevertheless, this thing is……」<br/>
「Fast!」<br/>
The moment Tio finished Hajime’s sentence, that thing showed its appearance, along with a high-pitched sound.<br/>
A hard-looking frame, in a delta shape, that had a trace of roundness with a sky blue color that could conceal itself within the azure sky appeared. Several long and narrow tubes were attached to its bottom part. There were five of them rushing straight toward the floating island in a beautiful triangular formation.<br/>
Seeing those things flying away instantly above Hajime and Tio, Hajime said,<br/>
「Why fighter planes!?」<br/>
He grandly acted the straight-man.<br/>
Yes, those things were obviously fighter planes. If compared to the existing aircraft on Earth, then these planes looked like space fighter aircraft that appeared in a movie based on the near future, but Hajime’s excellent eyes certainly caught sight of a few things. A human was riding inside the cockpit installed at the front part of the airframe, and that the tube things installed below the aircraft resembled the missiles on Earth.<br/>
「……Goshujin-sama. It seems our worldview art mistaken. If we hath to say what kind of world this is――it’s SF.」<br/>
「What’s with this chaos.」<br/>
A black rain that polluted the world, dragons, and a floating island in the sky, along with futuristic fighter planes flying through the sky.<br/>
Certainly, it was a chaotic world.<br/>
 <br/>
 <br/>
*KIIII* A hard sound resounded from the aircraft that drew a beautiful arc in the sky. The formation of five planes was circling above as though to observe the floating island, and then they took a distance for the moment.<br/>
「The other side should be able to see us too. It will be fine if they can communicate with us somehow.」<br/>
「For now, how about trying to talk with them using telepathy Goshujin-sama?」<br/>
Hajime and Tio talked with each other carefreely. Ahead of their gaze, one of the circling aircraft suddenly began to be clad with a strange light. The aircraft that was giving off a presence that felt increasingly like SF――or rather like a UFO―― released something akin to a ripple of light the moment it passed over the forest.<br/>
There wasn’t any thunderous sounds reverberating, or the forest getting blown up. But, there was certainly a result from that.<br/>
*KIIIIII-*<br/>
A hard sound that was different from the motor suddenly struck the ear.<br/>
「-, this is」<br/>
「A sound wave?」<br/>
Hajime and Tio scrunched up their faces reflexively. Tio immediately blocked the sound wave using a wind barrier, but even so, that sound attack caused her a headache.<br/>
Naturally, for the dragons whose hearing was better than Hajime and Tio and didn’t possess any barriers, this was an attack that would make them feel outrageous agony.<br/>
「「「「KUWAAAAAAAAH」」」」<br/>
The dragons raised a cry that sounded like a scream and flew out of the forest.<br/>
It seemed they fell into a panic. They frantically tried to distance themselves from the forest as much as they could. But then another plane fired its missile.<br/>
The missile that was approaching at high speed burst before it could impact the dragons, and from there a net was ejected.<br/>
The net spread widely and enveloped the dragons without even giving them time to twist their bodies. On top of that, the net wasn’t falling down but stayed fixed in midair and restrained the dragons. It was as though the dragons were locked inside a cage that was created in midair.<br/>
「A hunt, huh.」<br/>
「……I see. We art not helping?」<br/>
Tio didn’t sound angry. She merely asked as a question. Hajime made a wry smile.<br/>
「If there is someone being a nuisance to a fisherman saying"What are you doing catching the fish huh!", then that person is simply an idiot. No, rather he is a scoundrel that is hindering the fisherman’s work.」<br/>
「Certainly. It’s not something good if we who doth not know anything about this world interfere as we pleased.」<br/>
It was completely sound reasoning. They only had a bit of an interaction with the dragons, but it would be a lie if they said that they didn’t feel any attachment at all to the dragons whose reactions were like a stray dog. However, if they were asked whether they were so attached to the dragons to the degree that they would hinder the aircraft pilots who were possibly hunting the dragons to feed their families, or for some kind of important work, then the answer was a big NO.<br/>
「But, I’m curious to the working of that net that is fixed in midair and the sound wave attack and flashing phenomenon of the aircraft. No matter how I look at it, their driving force seems different compared to Earth’s aircraft……Perhaps, it might have the same principle with how this island is floating.」<br/>
「Either way, they art a party that we might be able to exchange words with. Letting this chance get away art not an option. The problem now art how to communicate with them, but……art we going to try sending them telepathy?」<br/>
「It will be great if my "Language Comprehension" and interpreter artifact can demonstrate their effect.」<br/>
Even while the two were conversing, most of the dragons that were flying out of the forest were captured. Hajime was observing to see how the dragons would be transported, but during that time, one of the aircraft circled around and was facing its nose toward Hajime and Tio.<br/>
「Oh, as expected, it looks like they noticed us. It seems the other side is the one coming to contact us?」<br/>
「Ri, right. It appears so but……for some reason, I hath a bad premonition though.」<br/>
Tio’s premonition was correct.<br/>
The moment *voo-* an instantaneous sound split the air and a sudden flash scattered from the lower part of the aircraft’s nose――wind of killing intent assaulted the two.<br/>
What was fired without any warning was a machine gun. The storm of bullets that were concealing terrible destructive power mercilessly rushed at Hajime and Tio. The surrounding ground was rupturing as though getting blown away. The thrown up cloud of dust hid the two from view.<br/>
The aircraft passed overhead Hajime and Tio as though nothing had happened and rejoined its comrades. It didn’t even give a glance at Hajime and Tio anymore. It was clear that the pilot thought the two weren’t an existence that was worth anything. It was only mowing grass in the corner of the garden that was an eyesore――that was how it felt like.<br/>
「……Calm down me. This is another world. Don’t judge things with our own common sense.」<br/>
「……Those guys……ignorance art truly terrifying isn’t it.」<br/>
The cloud of dust was carried away by the wind. What appeared from there was naturally the unharmed Hajime and Tio. A cube-shaped barrier was deployed around them using the Cross Velts. The strafing that had a might which resembled a 30mm Vulcan cannon was blocked without even a single crack on the barrier.<br/>
However, it was doubtful whether the heart of the person inside could block that kind of uncompromising tyranny.<br/>
Hajime was folding his arms with a vein pulsing on his forehead, but even so, he was trying to suppress his anger and persuade himself. Tio was directing a gaze that was shuddering in terror at the aircraft pilots. Of course, that shudder wasn’t directed toward their strength, but at their attitude that was picking a fight against a godslayer right from the front.<br/>
「This is a world with polluted land. Then, a ground that is floating in the sky must be really important for humans to live. Naturally, they should be managing and protecting it strictly. And now there are unknown people rudely stepping on it. I cannot complain even if I got shot without any warning whatsoever. Isn’t that right, me? That’s right, me.」<br/>
「Go, Goshujin-sama. I understand that thy art angry, so please stop that soliloquizing. Somehow it’s terrifying in a different meaning.」<br/>
The way to suppress anger Hajime-style――soliloquizing. When seen from the side, it was a skill that was wholly judged to be more terrifying than being angry normally.<br/>
Because on Earth there was no way he could uncompromisingly go "instant death for everyone♡" like when he was on Tortus. This was a patience skill that Hajime newly learned.<br/>
From afar, seeing how Hajime and Tio were unharmed, the pilot seemed to be taken aback and directed its aircraft’s nose toward the two once more.<br/>
Hajime cleared his throat once and called for a ceasefire while activating "Telepathy".<br/>
"Aa~, pilot-san, pilot-san. Can you hear? We don’t have any ill intention. If we are trespassing illegally, then we will apologize and get out right away. That’s why first let’s have a tal――"<br/>
Missile inbound!! Without warning, it went whoo~~~sh-!!<br/>
Of course, Hajime and Tio were unharmed.<br/>
"……"<br/>
"Sto, stop it! All of theee, doth thee hath a death wish!? Let’s hath a talk right now!"<br/>
Hajime was muttering to himself inaudibly.「Perhaps the telepathy didn’t go through. No, perhaps they didn’t understand the language. Perseverance is important in communication. Isn’t that’s right, me? That’s right, me」He was soliloquizing again. His eyes were completely not moving though.<br/>
"Please, listen to us. We――"<br/>
Missile comi~~~ng-!! Yes, whoo~~~~sh-!!<br/>
Perhaps the missile this time was of a different variety because it didn’t just explode it had an extra flame blast with viscosity. The surrounding was dyed crimson. However, inside the rumbling flame that was blazing, the two were standing still unharmed as expected.<br/>
Tio was getting flustered ‘awawawa’ while glancing at Hajime, but when she saw Hajime’s expression had gone past rage and he was starting to smile instead, she covered her face with both hands as though to say「I cannot bear to see this anymore!」<br/>
But, it would be troubling if the current Hajime was looked down on. In order for him to live normally in Japan on Earth, his homeland that believed in law and order, every day he was working hard not to use violence, but instead, he was learning a different type of strength that was patience and perseverance, negotiation power and financial strength.<br/>
He wouldn’t snap just from a small amount of machine gun strafing and missiles!<br/>
……It felt like the dragons would want to retort「Then why did you snap before this!?」if they knew it.<br/>
"Pilot-san, we――"<br/>
Hajime tried to call out once more with a voice that had lost any intonation. This time, finally there was a reaction. Although, the reaction wasn’t something that "came back" to Hajime, but a complete ignoring of Hajime.<br/>
"Chih, what the hell is this. Don’t tell me they are carrying a shielding device on the same level as a warship?"<br/>
"Vans-san, surely that’s impossible. Do you see anywhere any device with the size necessary for a shield of the warship level?"<br/>
"Are they an OOPArt owner? ……I want that."(TN: Out of Place Artifact)<br/>
"No way. You think there are any explorers in this era huh. Rather than that, look there. That woman. Her outfit is strange, but she is an extremely fine jewel, yeah? Hey, Vans-san? Looks like that guy is calling at us, so let’s land down and kill just the man, then give me that woman. The woman from before is not usable anymore. I want to make her my new pet."<br/>
It appeared these guys weren’t really guys with class. At the same time, it seemed that they were thinking that the conversation on their side wasn’t leaking out. Most likely, they were under the impression that the communication method Hajime and Tio was using was something like their own method. It seemed they thought that they couldn’t be heard because they were on a different frequency (?).<br/>
Hajime was silent. However, all the color was gradually leaving his smiling face.<br/>
In the middle of that, the man who seemed to be the leader called Vans-san said this to the man who made a remark of wanting to kill Hajime and taking only Tio as a pet.<br/>
"Hmph? Certainly, I’m curious about that abnormally strong shield. ……Fine then. We will land down and pull the information out from them. After that, kill the man――and I’ll take the woman."<br/>
"Eeh!? That’s unfair!"<br/>
"Don’t make a ruckus. I’ll lend her to you when I’m not using her."<br/>
"A~a, can’t be helped then~"<br/>
Their screwed up conversation was continuing. The five fighter planes――if following what they were saying, it seemed that the plane was called sky battlecraft――that were circling with their noses directed at Hajime and Tio were lowering their speed and altitude. Currently, in the conversation that was clearly being leaked out, the hot topics were about how they would kill Hajime or how they would rape Tio later.<br/>
「……Haa, the fools. They art waking up a monster that is not necessary to wake up. They art getting their just dessert.」<br/>
Tio’s words were muttered to herself.<br/>
The sky battlecrafts were approaching. The dragons were peeking at their direction from inside the net.<br/>
Hajime’s figure vanished instantly.<br/>
And then, the pilots of the sky battlecrafts, especially Vans who was flying in the lead as the first plane, began doubting their eyes.<br/>
"There is no need to get down. I’ll send you all down to hell myself."<br/>
A flat voice was resounding inside their heads. At the same time, an impossible sight appeared in front of them.<br/>
With a giant weapon loaded with a giant stake carried in one hand, a human silhouette jumped onto the front of the flying sky battlecraft’s cockpit while scattering crimson sparks.<br/>
「Eh? Ah? What――」<br/>
That became the last sentence of the man named Vans.<br/>
"What……the hell, is that!?"<br/>
"Just now, what happened!?"<br/>
"What is going on!?"<br/>
"Shit-, is that seriously some kind of OOPArt!?"<br/>
Panicked voices resounded.<br/>
The sight that they witnessed frightened them.<br/>
It was of a man jumping up a few hundred meters with a flesh and blood body, carrying a weapon that was unthinkable for any human to lift in one hand, literally pulverizing the first plane.<br/>
The wreckage of the first plane that was scattered into little pieces and shower of flesh and blood were raining down to the ground. A single black giant stake pierced the floating island like a gravestone.<br/>
The pilots that were cursing while rapidly turning their planes were treated with another absurd sight.<br/>
It was the sight of a barrage of giant stakes flying wildly everywhere.<br/>
"Sca, scatterrr!"<br/>
The plane that seemed to be the second in command immediately gave an order, but he was already too late. One plane received a direct hit and turned into scraps midair.<br/>
"Holy shit-, you bastard, I’ll absolutely murder――"<br/>
The one speaking turned speechless. His eyes were opened wide. That was natural. After all, the target was calmly standing in midair while causing crimson ripples to spread out; furthermore, in the hand opposite of the one carrying the weapon that was shooting out giant stakes――the gatling pile bunker――another giant weapon materialized.<br/>
The name of that weapon, which was put on the shoulder, was Agni – Orkan. It was a weapon that displayed the most power in surface-to-air combat.<br/>
Instantly, a great number of missiles were launched.<br/>
The man that was about to spit out a curse soundlessly screamed while steering his plane, but how could he possibly evade more than fifty missiles that were assaulting him from every direction. Naturally, his fate was decided.<br/>
One more flower of flame bloomed in the sky.<br/>
"Withdraw! We’re withdrawing!"<br/>
"Mo, monster-"<br/>
The two remaining sky battlecrafts circled with a maneuver that was possibly even more outstanding than aircraft made on Earth. They tried to retreat from the battlefield right away with their highest speed.<br/>
Their speed was also amazing, as expected, as they had turned into the size of a bean in one breath.<br/>
Hajime silently stowed away the gatling pile bunker and Agni – Orkan and took out the replacement weapon.<br/>
――Anti-Material Sniping Cannon   Schlagen AA (Acht Acht)<br/>
Across the scope, a sky battlecraft escaping to the sky far away was reflected.<br/>
"That was a good lesson, right? Use it as a reference in hell."<br/>
The trigger was pulled after that whisper. No matter how excellent the speed of the sky battlecraft was, there was no way they could match the speed of a bullet that was accelerated electromagnetically. One plane was pierced from its back part all the way up to its front part, and then its figure vanished into the sea of clouds appearing as though it had been skewered.<br/>
Hajime who was shouldering Schlagen AA called out to Tio.<br/>
「Tio. We are pursuing. We are annihilating――not, it appears that the plane is returning back toward its comrade’s location. Let’s thoroughly have them tell us about this world.」<br/>
「Aa, yes. That’s right.」<br/>
Tio was watching Hajime tear apart the nets capturing the dragons using a chakram with a wry smile while transforming into a dragon.<br/>
And then, Hajime rode on her back, and she started flying in the sky with terrific speed.<br/>
「Goshujin-sama, thank you.」<br/>
「……For what?」<br/>
Tio didn’t answer. Hajime also understood what it was about. She was happy that he exposed his wrath when the men said they would make her a pet.<br/>
Instead of answering, Tio’s acceleration that was far smoother than usual told the answer more eloquently than anything.<br/>
「Now then. Was that the standard of this world’s humans, or is it different? I’ll have them show me.」<br/>
「Thy art really on fire……」<br/>
Even while feeling a bit excited at the fierce gleam in the eyes of Hajime, who was facing an enemy, which she was seeing for the first time in a while, Tio was also feeling just a little pity at the vulgar residence of this world who angered the demon king right from the start.<br/>
<br/>
AN: Thank you very much for reading this every time.<br/>
Thank you very much too for the thoughts, opinions, and reports about misspelling and omitted words.<br/>
Recently, I’m unable to make it in time……I’m sorry.<br/>
Now then, just when you thought that it’s fantasy, it’s actually half SF! That kind of story.<br/>
Tio arc, just where in the world is it going to lead? Even Shirakome doesn’t know.<br/>
But, I’m writing while picturing an enjoyable development. Just like usual!<br/>
The next update is planned to be for 6 P.M Saturday too.<br/>
