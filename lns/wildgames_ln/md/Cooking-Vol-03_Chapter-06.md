Chapter 6: The End of the Banquet<br/>
「Here it comes, this is really the last meat!」<br/>
The additional grilled meat was sent to the plaza.<br/>
Just how much meat did everyone eat today? I already lost track, but the men and women all cheered and gathered.<br/>
I stood at the side of the Wu main house, watching over the scene as I said to the girl besides me:<br/>
「…Lala Wu, aren’t you eating?」<br/>
「No, I’m already full. If I eat too much, I will get fat.」<br/>
I think she could fatten up a bit more. Compared to her two elder sisters, she was too slender.<br/>
Lala Wu was twelve, and from her body type, she would probably grow taller. A few years later, she would surely be a charming lady that rivals her sisters.<br/>
「Ah, the flame during the last part is impressive. What is that?」<br/>
「It’s a strong liquor that will burn when lighted, not the usual fruit wine.」<br/>
And that of course, was the fruit wine Kamyua Yost gave to us as a present.<br/>
I couldn’t think of any other way to use it, so I just used it to liven up the last part of the banquet.<br/>
「That’s true.」<br/>
Lala Wu said disinterestedly, closed her eyes and said:<br/>
「Ema Min Lutim looks so stunning. She is a beauty, and the wedding dress made her even more glamourous.」<br/>
「That’s right. I’m surprised too… But, Lala Wu, your dress is nice too.」<br/>
Lala Wu was also in banquet wear of course.<br/>
She might be young, but when she let her hair down, she looked very feminine.<br/>
I carefully avoided complimenting her looks and just her clothes, but she still punched my back hard.<br/>
The intense pain stung my exhausted body.<br/>
「That hurts… So, you are looking for me?」<br/>
「Hmm? It’s nothing special… Have you seen Shin Wu?」<br/>
「Shin Wu? I don’t know, he should be hanging out with Ludo Wu.」<br/>
「Ludo Wu is with my other brothers. Strange, I just saw him with Shela Wu.」<br/>
It couldn’t be helped, this was a banquet with over a hundred people after all.<br/>
Even after my work was done, I still haven’t met Ai Fa.<br/>
「Yo, Asuta, thanks for your hard work. Not only did you need to tend to the hearth, you also had to deal with the retards from the Tsun clan, it must be tiring right?」<br/>
Speak of the devil. Ludo Wu suddenly appeared before us.<br/>
「If Jiza-nii wasn’t beside me, I would have beat them all up by myself. Well, forget it, it’s a Lutim house banquet after all, we should show some respect for the father of the Lutim house.」<br/>
「Bratty Ludo, don’t cause trouble. You better not get involved with the Tsun clan.」<br/>
「Shut up tomboy… And so? What are the two of you doing? Asuta you want to take this thing of ambiguous gender as your wife after all?」<br/>
When the enraged Lala Wu wanted to slap Ludo Wu, he dodged her nimbly.<br/>
「Don’t fight, this is a wedding… Ludo Wu, do you know where Shin Wu is?」<br/>
「Shin Wu? Ah, he is in the empty house you are staying in right now.」<br/>
When he said that, Ludo Wu frowned a little unhappily and continued:<br/>
「Speaking of which, Ai Fa is with him too… Damn it, I hope Shin Wu won’t say anything unnecessary.」<br/>
Unnecessary?<br/>
I found a missing piece of the puzzle in my tired mind.<br/>
「What do you mean? What did you instigate Shin Wu to do? By the way, why do Shin Wu want to speak with Ai Fa?」<br/>
「Shut up, it has nothing to do with you.」<br/>
Ludo Wu looked at me.<br/>
I nodded, and pulled back my shoulders that were leaning against the wall.<br/>
「Lala Wu, let’s go take a look. I’m also looking for Ai Fa.」<br/>
「Hmm? Okay…」<br/>
Lala Wu showed a weak expression. I grabbed her arm and walked to the plaza.<br/>
「Hey, what happened? What’s going on between Shin Wu and Ai Fa?」<br/>
「I don’t know yet. I don’t teally know Shin Wu’s temperament. Lala Wu, please help me talk to him.」<br/>
I went through the crowd with the puzzled Lala Wu, and headed to the empty house.<br/>
Everyone looked very pleased.<br/>
After the banquet ended, I could finally see everyone’s faces.<br/>
The men who always wore serious expression was smiling red faced now.<br/>
Meat and wine, family and kin, the orange burning flames, the strong groom and beautiful bride— There was plenty of things for them to be intoxicated by.<br/>
I was happy to have taken part in this banquet.<br/>
I was proud for finishing my job.<br/>
In this world, only Ai Fa could share this feeling with me.<br/>
「Ah…」<br/>
Lala Wu raised her voice.<br/>
The plaza was bright, but the empty house was very dim, with no one in sight. Ai Fa and Shin Wu’s figure appeared behind the empty house.<br/>
Shin Wu’s figure mixed into the crowd, and only Ai Fa was left behind.<br/>
「Shin! Shin Wu!」<br/>
Lala Wu shook off my hand and ran in the crowd.<br/>
And I naturally ran towards Ai Fa.<br/>
「Asuta…」<br/>
Ai Fa opened her eyes wide in surprise.<br/>
「What’s the matter? Did something happened?」<br/>
「No, we are fine.」<br/>
I stopped in front of Ai Fa.<br/>
The next instant, my right knee buckled.<br/>
Before I fell, Ai Fa’s strong arms supported me.<br/>
「What’s wrong? Are you feeling unwell?」<br/>
「No… I’m just too tired. In the end, I just grabbed some random things to eat.」<br/>
「Retard, you didn’t eat properly even though you have to do so much work?」<br/>
Ai Fa said angrily, then guide my body to lean against the wall.<br/>
「Wait here, I will bring some meat.」<br/>
「No, it’s fine. I can’t eat yet.」<br/>
I grabbed Ai Fa’s arm in a panic.<br/>
「The job is finally done, let me bask in the moment for a bit longer.」<br/>
After saying that, I slide down slowly and sat on the ground.<br/>
Ai Fa looked a little troubled, but she chose to sit besides me in the end.<br/>
But she didn’ prop up one knee like she usually does, but sat cross legged.<br/>
「Ai Fa, since you already dressed up, it will be fine if you acted more femininely.」<br/>
「Even you are saying such weird things. I only put this on because Grandma Jiba was very adamant about this.」<br/>
Ai Fa flicked her veil with her slender finger.<br/>
「I might be a woman, but I’m still the head of the Fa house, and a hunter. Others will just think it is hilarious if I put this on.」<br/>
「That’s not true. You might be the head of a house and a hunter, but you are also a woman.」<br/>
Seeing that Ai Fa looks unhappy, I smiled at her and said:<br/>
「This clothes really suits you. I’m not just paying lip service, you look really nice like this.」<br/>
Ai Fa’s cheeks didn’t blush. She looked as if she had choked on something, and looked very surprised.<br/>
Finally, she said:<br/>
「Don’t say something so ridiculous.」<br/>
She looked towards the plaza which showed no signs of ending any time soon.<br/>
「… Your work is done.」<br/>
「Yes, it’s over.」<br/>
「I don’t know what the future might bring, but you completed your job.」<br/>
「Yes.」<br/>
「Asuta, that’s your strength.」<br/>
Ai Fa had a thousand yard gaze.<br/>
How strange.<br/>
Up until just now, Ai Fa had been acting normally. But now, her existence felt very far away.<br/>
「Asuta.」<br/>
「Yes.」<br/>
「You should stay in the Lutim house.」<br/>
I stared at Ai Fa’s side profile.<br/>
Ai Fa still wouldn’t look my way.<br/>
「Kaslan Lutim acknowledged your strength. Even Dan Lutim did so. They might not let you marry into their main house, but just like how you are staying in my house, they will welcome you to be a part of the Lutim house even if you are not related to them by blood.」<br/>
「Hey.」<br/>
「When your bonds with them deepen, they might be willing to let you marry into the branch house. And then, you will have a place in Forest’s Edge—」<br/>
「What are you talking about? Why are you saying this all of a sudden?」<br/>
I pressed her for answers.<br/>
Ai Fa still wouldn’t look at me.<br/>
「… Let me ask you instead, why are you staying in the Fa house?」<br/>
「You are asking me now…?」<br/>
「The Fa house isn’t as well off as the Wu house or Lutim house. I don’t want to eat such lavish food either. You can only use aria, poitan, kiba and just a bit of vegetable as ingredients, and cook meals for two— will that be enough to satisfy you?」<br/>
「I’m very satisfied. I’m not cooking for you as a head chef, but as a family and Fa house hearth tender. The job of a hearth caretaker is to serve up a meal within the limited budget.」<br/>
「And you are satisfied just with that?」<br/>
「Yes.」<br/>
I answered unhesitantly.<br/>
「Working as a chef makes me glad. I feel happy, elated and blissed. But I don’t want to tend the hearth for the Wu clan or Lutim house, but the Fa house. You are the one who I want to taste my meat the most.」<br/>
「……」<br/>
「There might be another madman who wants me to care take their hearth for one night. I will welcome such a job. I hope to keep that anticipation in mind and continue cooking for the Fa house.」<br/>
「But…」<br/>
Ai Fa looked somewhere else and muttered softly:<br/>
「I deepened the grudge with the Tsun clan again today/」<br/>
「Me too.」<br/>
「I’m strong enough to protect myself. But when I enter the forest, I won’t be able to protect you who will be home alone.」<br/>
「In that case…」<br/>
「But the Lutim house and Wu clan can protect you. Even if they look for trouble like today, the Tsun clan won’t have the guts to clash with the Wu clan and Lutim house.」<br/>
「……」<br/>
「Asuta, it’s too dangerous for you to stay in the Fa house.」<br/>
「… Is that what you think?」<br/>
I pressed Ai Fa again.<br/>
But she didn’t waver.<br/>
「It’s too late for that now right? We already ran into Doddo Tsun seven days ago. So why are you only saying this now?」<br/>
「… Since that day, you have been staying in the We village.」<br/>
「That’s right. But you just told me this morning that "we will go back to our usual lives tomorrow", so why say all this now?」<br/>
「… We deepened our grudge with the Tsun clan again today. And you showed your capability to the Lutim house.」<br/>
「Is that all?」<br/>
「… Someone told me that you shouldn’t stay in the Fa house.」<br/>
「Was it Leina Wu?」<br/>
「……」<br/>
「That’s what I thought. I should be grateful to her for being concerned about me, but…」<br/>
Leina Wu’s sorrowful face flashed in my mind.<br/>
「That’s how she feels, not me. I just want to act according to how you and I feel.」<br/>
「……」<br/>
「I already made up my mind, I want to stay in the Fa house. Unless you feels frustrated by it and wants to chase me away, then I will leave.」<br/>
「… If I tell you to get lost, would you?」<br/>
I grabbed Ai Fa’s shoulder that was further away from me angrily, and forced her to face me.<br/>
Ai Fa could have brushed away my arms, but she didn’t resist.<br/>
Her blue eyes finally looked my way.<br/>
「I want to stay by your side. Until you grow tired of me, I don’t want to leave. If you want to chase me away, you can try with all your might… Although your strength is greater than mine.」<br/>
「……」<br/>
「You said you didn’t want me to disappear, was that a lie?」<br/>
A fire burned in Ai Fa’s eyes.<br/>
「I don’t want you to disappear, or for you to be in danger. That is why I am asking you to become a member of the Lutim house.」<br/>
「Is that so? Even if that is what you think, I still want to stay by your side. If— the Tsun clan becomes a real danger, we will think of something. In the worst case, we can ask Kamyua Yost for help.」<br/>
「… That man is a citizen of Rock City.」<br/>
「 If you are not willing to, I will give up on that thought. If not, I will prostrate to the Wu clan and Lutim house, and beg them to protect me who isn’t their kin— I’m willing to go that far in order to not leave you.」<br/>
The fire in Ai Fa’s eyes started wavering.<br/>
Was she angry? Or did some other emotions she herself didn’t understand had sprout forth?<br/>
Even though she was a woman, Ai Fa had the air of a hunter about her.<br/>
The female hunter Ai Fa was an unique existence in Forest’s Edge.<br/>
And I —<br/>
「… Why was Shin Wu looking for you?」<br/>
「What?」<br/>
「You spoke with him just now right? Did he asked you about "sacrificial hunting style"? In order to feed his five family members, he wanted to use the "sacrificial hunting style" too— Did he find you in order to discuss this?」<br/>
「……」<br/>
「Ai Fa, how did you answer him?」<br/>
「… I told him that "sacrificial hunting style" was too dangerous. If he succumbs to the forest, then who will protect his five family members?」<br/>
「I see. But you have me as your family too, but you are still using the "sacrificial hunting style" right? Is the sweet scent on you from the fruit that attracts kiba?」<br/>
Ai Fa’s face turned a little pale.<br/>
Despite her agitated emotions, she still felt embarrassed when I mentioned her scent.<br/>
I like the scent on her—<br/>
The sweet smell of the fruit that attracts kiba.<br/>
The refreshing aroma of herbs.<br/>
The stinging scent of the pico leaves.<br/>
The gentle fragrance of the Krilee fruit.<br/>
The delectable smell of meat and fats.<br/>
All these smell combined into the Ai Fa’s scent— and I like this scent.<br/>
It was a scent unique to Ai Fa.<br/>
The unique scent of Ai Fa who took on the jobs of both the men and women by herself.<br/>
Only Ai Fa would have this smell that merges both the forest and a home.<br/>
「Don’t do something so dangerous for the sake of hunting— Ai Fa, you won’t want anyone to tell you that.」<br/>
「……」<br/>
「It’s the same for me. I don’t want anyone to tell me that caretaking the hearth in the Fa house is a dangerous job.」<br/>
Ludo Wu’s words echoed in my mind.<br/>
— Don’t worry about her, respect her instead.<br/>
Ai Fa craved hunting kiba so much that she resorts to such a dangerous method.<br/>
In order to live as a denizen of Forest’s Edge— to live as a hunter.<br/>
If she stop using the "sacrificial hunting style", she would need to give up on her identity as a hunter. And marry into some other houses as a woman.<br/>
If Ai Fa wants to reject this fate and live on as a hunter—<br/>
If Ai Fa could only become a strong, noble and elegant existence by doing so—<br/>
Then I wouldn’t refute Ai Fa’s choice.<br/>
I was attracted to her because Ai Fa was such a person.<br/>
Ai Fa had both the scent of a forest and a home, possessing the tenacity of a hunter and the gentleness of a girl. I want to stay by her side because that was the kind of person she was.<br/>
「I will think about how to deal with the Tsun clan. Ai Fa, let me stay by your side. I want to be with you.」<br/>
Ai Fa turned quiet for a moment.<br/>
She looked at me with the intense light in her eyes, as if she was probing my intent.<br/>
After who knows how long—<br/>
Ai Fa averted her face and muttered 「do whatever you want.」<br/>
She pouted her lips a little.<br/>
Her cheeks were still slightly blushed.<br/>
She was finally back to her usual self.<br/>
At this moment, a large figure walked towards us with a crisp sound of metal ringing out.<br/>
「Sorry for disturbing at such a busy time. Asuta and Ai Fa, can I have a bit of your time?」<br/>
The man before us was actually Kaslan Lutim.<br/>
This brave hunter wearing a cape that had the head of a kiba attached looked down at us silently.<br/>
「Ah, hello, we aren’t busy.」<br/>
When I answered, I realized I was still grabbing Ai Fa’s shoulders, and unhand her in a hurry.<br/>
Ai Fa had turned her face away with her cheeks beet red and lips pouting. No matter how you looked at it, we were in the middle of something.<br/>
And this guy could actually talk to us at such a moment, he was really brave.<br/>
「My apologies. It’s hard for me to leave the main event, so I still came to greet you despite it being rude.」<br/>
「Ah, it’s fine.」<br/>
I stood up.<br/>
Ai Fa also stood up, and elbowed my sides really hard.<br/>
「I don’t know if I can see you two tomorrow, so I want to bring you your payment tonight.」<br/>
He took out the outstanding payment— the tusks and horns of ten kiba.<br/>
It must be a part of the blessings he received for the wedding. He strung them up carefully with a rope.<br/>
「Thank you for your delicious cooking. I believe I made the right decision after seeing how blissed my kin looked.」<br/>
「I want to thank you for believing in me… And congratulations on your wedding.」<br/>
「Thank you.」<br/>
The groom showed a bashful smile.<br/>
「Regarding the matter with the Tsun clan— I’m sorry that you have become the subject of their scorn. Father Dan and Donda Wu both drew their blades in rage, and the men around them had to suppress them in the meantime.」<br/>
「No, we made a stand of our own conviction, I’m just afraid that this will bring trouble to the Lutim house.」<br/>
「No matter how much we worry, trouble will still find us at any moment. I realized this tonight.」<br/>
Kaslan Lutim’s honest eyes showed a strong gleam.<br/>
「However, the Tsun probably couldn’t do as they please. Even if they think we are an eyesore, there wouldn’t be anyone hunting the kiba without us. To protect their peaceful life, they won’t clash with the Wu clan or Lutim house.」<br/>
「I see, are you refering to the prize money given to them by the city…? I can’t believe those people are actually from Forest’s Edge.」<br/>
「You’re right— But you are different. The Fa house only have two members, so the Tsun clan won’t hesitate in exterminating you.」<br/>
Kaslan Lutim said in a heavier tone:<br/>
「However, if the Wu clan and Lutim house are close to the two of you, they wouldn’t dare to go too far… That being said, they still did something so outrageous tonight. Ai Fa, Asuta, please take care of yourself.」<br/>
「Alright, we will keep that in mind.」<br/>
Kaslan Lutim nodded, and then looked at the necklace I received from him.<br/>
「By the way, is twenty kiba really enough? I wouldn’t mind giving you all the blessings I received tonight.」<br/>
「It’s more than enough. I’m very happy! I will spend it unhesitatingly in the next few days.」<br/>
After saying that, I turned to Ai Fa whose cheeks were still a little blushed:<br/>
「We can buy a new pot now! The Fa house can have soup and grilled dish at the same time. House head, all that hard work is worth it right?」<br/>
Ai Fa continued to pout and kicked me lightly.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
