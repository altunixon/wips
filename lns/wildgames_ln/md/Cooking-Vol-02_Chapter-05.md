Final Chapter<br/>
I spent another night in an empty house located within the Wu clan village.<br/>
The three guests from the Lutim house would be heading to the house of Donda Wu’s nephew whom they were closed with to retire for the night.<br/>
However, there was still a party going on in the Wu main house.<br/>
After dinner, the Wu family members except for unwed women drank and make merry with the three guests.<br/>
After Ai Fa and I cleaned up the aftermath of dinner, we went together with Rimee Wu to Grandma Jiba’s room to chat, then finally returned here to rest.<br/>
I sprawled out on the floor right after entering the room and made an  「Uwah～!」 sound.<br/>
「Not only was the meat tough, I also made such a long speech, it made my mouth really tired! I can’t speak another word tonight!」<br/>
「……」<br/>
「If that is so, stop talking to yourself so loudly…… aren’t you going to retort like this?」<br/>
I turned back to look at Ai Fa. My mistress was sitting crossed legged by the wall with one knee up, and her expression was solemn.<br/>
「What’s the matter? In the end, Donda Wu didn’t give his comment, does that worry you?」<br/>
「……」<br/>
「It will be fine! If he didn’t acknowledge my cooking, he would have told us on the spot. And the guests from house Lutim looks satisfied, so there is no way the Wu clan can convince all their kin house to break ties with the Fa house.」<br/>
「… I’m not thinking about that.」<br/>
When we were at the banquet and Grandma Jiba’s room, her eyes looked so calm. But she was too quiet now, and looked glumly.<br/>
I really hate seeing her like this.<br/>
「What’s the matter? What are your thinking? Don’t dwell over it alone, you can tell me anything.」<br/>
I crawled towards her after saying that.<br/>
If it was the usual Ai Fa, she would angrily retort 「don’t act so disgustingly!」, but she didn’t react at all.<br/>
I felt like a retard.<br/>
But that wasn’t wrong either.<br/>
「Asuta, you—」<br/>
「Hmm?」<br/>
「Are you planning to leave Forest’s Edge?」<br/>
Ai Fa said suddenly.<br/>
I was seriously surprised.<br/>
「What are you saying all of a sudden? I don’t get it at all.」<br/>
「The things you said at the banquet is like a farewell speech to everyone. You wish to leave behind medicine, not poison before you are gone— to me, that’s what you are saying.」<br/>
The candle lighted up half of Ai Fa’s face as she slowly looked my way.<br/>
「Am I right?」<br/>
「Not really… But, something like that.」<br/>
It was unsightly to talk while lying down, so I sat crossed legged like Ai Fa too.<br/>
「Like I told you quite some time ago, my feelings remain the same. I don’t know why I have been thrown into this world, but since there are humans here too, I hope to keep a cordial relation with everyone. Instead of being harmful, I hope I can help everyone instead, and I was just explaining how I really felt.」<br/>
「……」<br/>
「But like I said before, since I got thrown into this world out of nowhere, I might get thrown back one day too. If I go back, I might get squashed by the house or burned by the fire. Therefore, I want to live without regrets since that might happen one day… I don’t really know myself, but I probably showed such an emotion, right?」<br/>
「… Do you think about this all the time?」<br/>
「No no, that’s impossible! I will get a mental breakdown! But this isn’t something I can just forget, so I will show these feelings occasionally.」<br/>
Ai Fa looked at me a little gloomily, then said with her head tilted slightly:<br/>
「… I have never thought about it.」<br/>
「Hmm?」<br/>
「I have never thought about you disappearing suddenly one day.」<br/>
Ai Fa said quietly.<br/>
Her reaction wasn’t cold— she said it calmly.<br/>
「… Because you don’t think I’m from another world in the first place, right? It must be hard for you to imagine someone can disappear and appear just like that. Or rather, even I find it hard to imagine.」<br/>
「……」<br/>
「But, I won’t leave if such a ridiculous supernatural phenomenon don’t force me to! I’m afraid of being abandoned by you instead… That’s why, if I ever disappear without a trace, it must be the work of gods or demons, so don’t forget to wish me RIP in Peace when the time comes.」<br/>
Ai Fa opened her mouth, when she made the shape of saying 「I」—<br/>
But I didn’t hear what she said next.<br/>
Because the door was knocked.<br/>
Cock, cock, two knocks.<br/>
Ai Fa stood up slowly and stopped before the door.<br/>
「Who is it?」<br/>
「… Head of the Wu clan Donda Wu.」<br/>
He came.<br/>
The demon king himself.<br/>
I considered the possibility that he will come personally, but was still surprised when he really did.<br/>
Ai Fa removed the door bar silently, and opened the door.<br/>
A large shadow slipped into the room like a huge predator.<br/>
After saying 「sorry to intrude」, he started taking off his shoes.<br/>
I checked for a sabre on his waist.<br/>
He wasn’t armed, and had a bottle of fruit wine in his left hand instead.<br/>
Donda Wu wished to have a cordial meeting— I probably could interpret it this way.<br/>
His huge and heavy body walked towards me, and he sat down near the candle stand by the window.<br/>
Donda Wu’s large eyes surveyed the room boredly.<br/>
「You two don’t drink, so what are you doing in the middle of the night?」<br/>
「We are about to turn in.」<br/>
「Hmmp.」<br/>
He bit open the cork and took a swig of fruit wine.<br/>
He just finished a drinking session and he started another one. He was good with alcohol.<br/>
As his face looked fierce all the time, I couldn’t discern his feelings, but he didn’t seem to be showing intense emotions.<br/>
His pair of beast-like eyes were lively and guarded, his gaze was probably always this strong.<br/>
He looked more composed than usual.<br/>
But we were too close.<br/>
He would usually sit in the seat of honour with an arrogant face, but our proximity was close enough to share the light from the same candlestand. I could feel enormous pressure from him just sitting there.<br/>
After replacing the door bar, Ai Fa sat at a place that formed a triangle with me and Donda Wu.<br/>
We were so close that our knees were almost touching.<br/>
Donda Wu pushed the bottle towards the tip of Ai Fa’s nose and said: 「Drink.」<br/>
「Drink it, and swear… swear that you will only speak your true thoughts.」<br/>
Ai Fa drank the fruit wine quietly without hesitation.<br/>
She coolly took a large swig of alcohol.<br/>
And then passed the bottle to me.<br/>
The mood right now didn’t seem to permit me who was underage to refuse. To avoid choking, I carefully tilted the bottle, and took a mouthful of fruit wine.<br/>
Ara, it tasted sour and sweet.<br/>
「… Brat, what are you actually scheming?」<br/>
Donda Wu started his talking:<br/>
「The Wu clan is not related to you by blood nor your benefactor. So why are you spouting nonsense about bonds with the Wu clan? Just what are you scheming?」<br/>
No matter how composed or quiet, he was still a burly man who looked like the incarnation of a kiba. His eyes were bright in the dim night, and his huge body emitted pressure.<br/>
I don’t have any schemes — When I was thinking about answering that way, I held back and realized I couldn’t speak like that.<br/>
Since he forbid me from lying, the best option was to confess everything truthfully—<br/>
「Instead of scheming, I was driven by one thought. That’s to earn your acknowledgement, Donda Wu.」<br/>
「… Acknowledgement?」<br/>
「Yes. No matter what cuisine I served, I will only cook dinner for one night. I’m the hearth tender for the Fa house after all, and the Wu clan won’t let me tend the hearth that often. But if that is the case— if I only serve you a delicious meal for one night, can you grasp the meaning and value of these cooking? I started to doubt that.」<br/>
I never thought I would be making another speech tonight.<br/>
But this was the reason behind everything I did today, so there was no other way.<br/>
「For example, if I put in a lot of effort to prepare a delicious meal, will you receive calm and satisfaction from that? If I’m a restaurant owner and you are a guest, then things might be settled like this. But if I barged into your house to serve you food because you said "there’s no distinction of food being delicious or not"? And then you say adamantly "it’s tasty, but so what?" Then everything ends」<br/>
「……」<br/>
「You are the head of the Wu clan, if enjoying delicious food is something you did together with your family— if the dishes are made by your family instead of some weird outsider— if you yourself can tell it is delicious, I think your soul will be more serene and satisfied than ever before.」<br/>
「……」<br/>
「That’s why I prepared three types of meat, it’s a way to earn your acknowledgement. If I only prepared steak or hamburg steak, some might think hamburg steak is delicious, and will be unhappy if they can’t taste it again. In that case, I want these three type of meat dish to compete with the hamburg steak. That way, everyone will be able to easily understand what you and Jiba Wu meant by "Everyone has different opinion on what is right, and what is delicious".」<br/>
「Why exactly… are you doing this, what do you stand to gain? To bet the life of you and your house head for this?」<br/>
Donda Wu said with a deep voice.<br/>
I sighed and said:<br/>
「You are the one who said anything about breaking off ties, right? Ai Fa and I are more headstrong than you think… After all, we are so stubborn that we didn’t listen to Grandma Jiba’s advice, which probably had you worried too, right? If you announce that you are breaking off ties with us, Rimee Wu and the others will definitely hate you.」<br/>
Donda Wu’s knees shook.<br/>
Just that was enough to make me feel that I was in mortal danger. But I was furious about what happened this time and continued:<br/>
「I don’t know what your true intention is, and don’t want to ask you either, but please be careful about risking your bonds with your family. You think Ai Fa and I will flee if you bring up the Lutim house and escalate this incident? If we fail, the Wu clan will have to break ties with the Fa house, and there will friction in your relationship with Rimee Wu and your other family members, isn’t that serious? I can’t ask you to think much of an outsider like me, but if you make things difficult and arduous for others because of an idea you thought up on a whim, and risk the bonds with your family, that will be too foolish.」<br/>
「Brat, you little…」<br/>
「It’s fine for you to hate Ai Fa and me. But Rimee Wu and Jiba Wu cherish her deeply and think of her as family. Please don’t forget that… If you still think of yourself as the head of the Wu clan.」<br/>
I decided to tell him what I think was right.<br/>
If I had a bit of doubt or fear in my actions— I probably would have lost control of my bladder, wailed out in tears or burrow my head into the ground.<br/>
That was how intense Donda Wu’s gaze was. He had already abandoned his composure and was burning up like a beast.<br/>
I witnessed these eyes three days ago. The group of hunters heading into the forest all had these eyes of a warrior.<br/>
「I— still don’t understand Forest’s Edge.」<br/>
As his eyes seem to be scorching my very soul, I put together my words subconsciously:<br/>
「All of you are different from the people I know… Honestly, I won’t be able to understand or empathize with you in the future either. However, I still hope to be a medicine, not a poison. That’s what I sincerely think. My only good point is knowing how to cook… I hope I can stay true to myself and live here in Forest’s Edge.」<br/>
What kind of expression was Ai Fa showing?<br/>
The intensity of her gaze was probably as strong as Donda Wu— but I couldn’t pull my eyes away from this large man to confirm.<br/>
「Like what I described earlier, chefs are not needed to cook a family meal. What you are after isn’t the cooking of a chef, but the serenity in your soul when you enjoy your time with your family— If there is anything wrong with this conclusion I made, I will return all the blessings I received from the Wu clan to you.」<br/>
The shadow— stood up slowly.<br/>
Ai Fa quickly stood between me and the shadow.<br/>
「… I will ask you again. Why are you willing to risk your life for this?」<br/>
Perhaps he was overwhelmed with rage, his voice lacked emotion and sounded cold. It echoed in the room like thunder.<br/>
「Because I’m a chef. Just like you being a hunter, I’m a chef… Although I’m just an immature half assed chef.」<br/>
I tried to answer humorously.<br/>
After a few seconds that seemed to last an eternity—<br/>
Donda Wu finally turned his back to me and said:<br/>
「I’m a hunter, I can’t fathom the thoughts of the likes of you.」<br/>
He muttered quietly without any emotions, then headed for the entrance.<br/>
He picked up his shoes with his right hand and didn’t put them on. After removing the door bar, he said quietly:<br/>
「… Speaking of unfathomable, that stupid old man from house Lutim wants me to pass a message.」<br/>
「Eh?」<br/>
「He wants you to tend the hearth for the wedding seven days later… The head of the Lutim actually said something so outrageous, looks like their house’s days are numbered.」<br/>
I couldn’t close my wide open mouth.<br/>
What was that old man thinking?<br/>
As I was in a daze, something rolled to my feet.<br/>
Donda Wu tossed something over from the entrance.<br/>
That was — A tusk and a horn that was white as snow, with a majestic bend on them.<br/>
「Those are blessings.」 After saying that, Donda Wu’s large body disappeared into the darkness.<br/>
「… So this incident has finally ended.」<br/>
I picked them up, and handed one of them to Ai Fa.<br/>
My fingers were still shaking, how shameful.<br/>
.<br/>
Ai Fa accepted it in silence, and stood up to bar the door.<br/>
「Sigh… I feel like my lifespan has shortened by several years.」<br/>
Leaning on the wall, my eyes followed her figure.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
I had been breaking out in cold sweat all this time.<br/>
However, I have finally — put an end to this dispute.<br/>
It all started with my willfulness, a once in a lifetime battle of the tongues.<br/>
「However, is the part about me tending to the hearth for the wedding a joke? No matter what, that’s too heavy a responsibility! I have to turn this job down.」<br/>
Ai Fa didn’t answer, and walked back after setting the door bar.<br/>
She had been quiet for quite some time now.<br/>
By the way, Ai Fa didn’t speak at all when Donda Wu was here.<br/>
While I was looking at Ai Fa with doubtful eyes, she came towards me with smooth strides.<br/>
She then — sat down right before me.<br/>
Her pink lips slowly formed the word 「I」.<br/>
「… I don’t want.」<br/>
「W-What?」<br/>
「I don’t want you to suddenly disappear.」<br/>
Her voice was calm as usual, and didn’t raise her volume.<br/>
There was no tears in her wild cat-like eyes either.<br/>
Her fingers didn’t touch me.<br/>
Her shoulders weren’t trembling.<br/>
Ai Fa just looked into my eyes quietly.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
