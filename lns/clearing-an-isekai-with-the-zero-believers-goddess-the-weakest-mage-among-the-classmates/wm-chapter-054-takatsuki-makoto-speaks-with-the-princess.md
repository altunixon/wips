<br/>
"The Makkaren Adventurer, Takatsuki Makoto, don’t make Princess Noel wait!" <br/>
You don’t need to call me by full name each time. I hear you.<br/>
"Do I have to go?" (Makoto)<br/>
I try asking my comrades.<br/>
"Of course you have to!" (Lucy)<br/>
"Takatsuki-sama, you must not make a careless mistake." (Nina)<br/>
"Do your best~." (Aya)<br/>
Sa-san who is gulping down roast beef waves her hand at me.<br/>
Damn it, treating this as if it is someone else’s business.<br/>
I walk with heavy steps towards the place where the knight order and the noble-like bunch is gathered. <br/>
I feel like the tables and food are completely different from those of the Hero Bar.<br/>
Intricately designed tables, extravagant-looking bottles of wine, and exquisite dishes lined up. Can I grab a few?<br/>
"Hey there, Takatsuki-kun." (Sakurai)<br/>
"Aah, Sakurai-kun. I was called here for some reason." (Makoto)<br/>
"I was talking about Takatsuki-kun to Princess Noel, and she said she would love to have a talk with you." (Sakurai)<br/>
So it was your fault!<br/>
I look at him with resentful eyes and he went ‘sorry sorry’ and apologized. And then, I was brought in front of an elegant woman.<br/>
At her side there’s the old man that has been managing this event for a while now.<br/>
If I remember correctly, the prime minister counselor? <br/>
"You are Takatsuki Makoto, huh. Hmph, that’s no attire to have in front of a princess." <br/>
"…"<br/>
What is this old man saying after calling me here all of a sudden? <br/>
"What’s your profession?" <br/>
"…Apprentice magician." (Makoto)<br/>
I am a Spirit User, but even if I have the Skill, it isn’t accepted as a profession.<br/>
So, I speak out the profession that’s written in my Soul Book.<br/>
"Apprentice, you say?! You are not one of the comrades that came with the heroes from the parallel world?! To think a lowly commoner like you is—" <br/>
"Robert, I called him. Stand back." <br/>
"Yes, my apologies." <br/>
The old man named Robert reluctantly takes a step back.<br/>
I don’t think I can get along with that guy.<br/>
"Nice to meet you, Makoto-sama. I am the Sun Princess, Noel Highland. Your help in the subjugation of the Taboo Dragons was a great achievement." (Noel)<br/>
Her clear voice is like a musical instrument and it passed through my ears pleasantly.<br/>
She has beautiful blonde hair and big blue eyes.<br/>
A princess drawn in paintings was right in front of me.<br/>
"I am Takatsuki Makoto. Thank you very much. But Sakurai-kun defeated the Taboo Dragons on his own." (Makoto)<br/>
"That’s not true. It is thanks to Takatsuki-kun that there wasn’t a single casualty." (Sakurai)<br/>
Sakurai-kun came from the side.<br/>
"Oh my, you two get along well." (Noel)<br/>
Noel-ojousama is all smiles.<br/>
Her smile is charming, and it even made me wonder whether it actually had charm magic on it.<br/>
I heard that she is one of the most influential people from the biggest country of this continent, but she is a lot more straightforward of a person than I imagined.<br/>
"I will be giving you our thanks officially eventually. This time around, it is only for greetings." (Noel)<br/>
"Uhm, I am honored to be able to speak with you." (Makoto)<br/>
No good, I don’t know what to even say. <br/>
Sakurai-kun! Save me!<br/>
I glanced at my classmate.<br/>
"Princess Noel, he is a skilled mage. How about inviting him to the kingdom as a guest?" (Sakurai)<br/>
No! That’s not what I was asking, Sakurai-kun.<br/>
Read the mood! <br/>
"It is rare for Ryousuke-sama to say that. But he is a citizen of the Water Country of Rozes. We would get scolded by Sofia-sama, you know? Isn’t that right, Sofia-sama?" (Noel)<br/>
Geh, now that she mentions it, she is indeed here.<br/>
I glanced for a bit, and there was the princess of Rozes, the Water Oracle, Princess Sofia standing there.<br/>
"Yes, he is part of our country. Nice to meet you, Takatsuki Makoto. Thanks for your hard work on this occasion." (Sofia)<br/>
"…"<br/>
This girl, has she forgotten about me?<br/>
Well, there’s no way a princess would remember the face of each person she has met only once.<br/>
Should I be saying ‘nice to meet you’ here too? While I was thinking that, the knight at her side shouted at me.<br/>
Aah, it is that guy.<br/>
It has been a while.<br/>
"How insolent! You are in the presence of Princess Sofia! Kneel!" <br/>
Ah, was it wrong to be standing in front of the princess?<br/>
I glance at Princess Noel.<br/>
"Today is a formality free day", is what Princess Noel says with a smile.<br/>
Hm, how benevolent.<br/>
Princess Noel has a lot of flexibility.<br/>
Princess Sofia doesn’t show a single smile as she continues.<br/>
"It is okay, Takatsuki Makoto. I’ve heard you are an exemplar mage. I will grant you the divine protection of our Goddess. We will welcome you as a mage of our honorable Water Country." (Sofia)<br/>
Huh? What is this woman saying?<br/>
"Be grateful for the generosity of Princess Sofia! I will be wringing you out from today on." <br/>
The haughty knight at her side is saying something.<br/>
…It is pissing me off.<br/>
My anger of 2 years ago is coming back up.<br/>
"No thanks." (Makoto)<br/>
"…What?" <br/>
The knight of Princess Sofia draws nearer.<br/>
"You bastard, do you understand your own standing?" <br/>
"Takatsuki Makoto, what is it you are unsatisfied about?" (Sofia)<br/>
Ah, these people…<br/>
Brazenly saying all that.<br/>
"2 years ago, when I desperately pleaded to become a believer of the Water Goddess, you didn’t even spare me a glance, and yet, this time around you are telling me to become your ally? That’s quite shameless there." (Makoto)<br/>
No, that’s not it.<br/>
These guys are royalty and nobility and all that stuff, so they are important. <br/>
That’s why it is natural that they act in whatever way they want, and it wouldn’t be a good idea to go against them here.<br/>
But wagging my tail here and becoming their subordinate…isn’t something I am looking forward to.<br/>
"…Could you possibly be…" (Sofia)<br/>
Princess Sofia seems to have remembered something.<br/>
"You bastard! What a way to speak to Princess Sofia! Don’t think you can stay in Rozes!" <br/>
The knight by her side was threatening me blatantly.<br/>
"Then, I will leave. There’s no way in hell I would work for the sake of a bunch like you." (Makoto)<br/>
Aah, I said it.<br/>
(Oh my, Makoto, you are quite quick tempered, huh.) (Noah)<br/>
I lack the experience, Goddess-sama.<br/>
"Oh, Takatsuki-sama. If you don’t have a place to go to, you are always welcome in Highland, you know." (Noel)<br/>
Princess Noel proposes with a smile.<br/>
Princess Sofia at the side is making a displeased expression.<br/>
"Takatsuki-kun…if you are troubled by anything, please tell me anytime." (Sakurai)<br/>
"Yeah…thanks, Sakurai-kun." (Makoto)<br/>
I lowered my head lightly to Princess Noel and Sakurai-kun.<br/>
And without meeting eyes with Princess Sofia and the knight at her side, I left the place.<br/>
Hmm, did I mess up there?<br/>
