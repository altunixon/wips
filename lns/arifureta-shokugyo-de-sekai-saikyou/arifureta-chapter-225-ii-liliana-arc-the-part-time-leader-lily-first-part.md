Arifureta After II   The Part-Time Leader Lily   First Part<br/>
<br/>
AN: I’ll submit one more chapter for the commemoration of the resumption.<br/>
Part Time Leader Lily Second Part will be around 8 or 9 o’clock.<br/>
<br/>
「Hafuu~」<br/>
That kind of sigh, which was free of tension, resounded inside the room that gave off a sense of cleanliness with its white tone.<br/>
Her own sigh unexpectedly echoed loudly causing Liliana to be taken aback, and then she frowned with a speechless expression, perhaps because she was letting out that sigh unconsciously.<br/>
For some reason or another, she kept leaning her back deeply on the reclining chair she was sitting on, and then she kicked on the floor with the bare tips of her toes and tried turning around. The good quality chair lightly rotated and the state of the room was reflected in Liliana’s sight in order.<br/>
It was a room that was half the size of the room that she was using until just some time ago in the palace.<br/>
Liliana herself thought that this size was just right, but if the nobles and servants in Tortus knew about this, then they might yell「How can the princess be made to live in this kind of small dog house!」with a look like Edvard Munch’s The Scream.<br/>
A few months had passed since the day when "Princess Liliana" went inactive and arrived on Earth. The more the months and days passed, the more she made in Earth accessories bit by bit.<br/>
The puppet "Dancing Davis-kun" that she received from Myuu at the moving celebration was emitting its presence excessively. Surely, the expression "quivering" suited the puppet more than "dancing". It was vibrating *jiggle jiggle* like a dangerous person who was going through withdrawal symptoms.<br/>
Just from where in the world did Myuu obtain this Davis-kun……<br/>
Honestly speaking it was eerie, but when she recalled Myuu’s smiling face whenever she thought of throwing it away, she was unable to throw it away.<br/>
「Fuu~~n」<br/>
Liliana was letting out a strange exhalation that lacked in tension while rotating her chair one more time. She then stepped a bit and rotated in reverse. Whirl whirl. Whirl whirl.<br/>
「Nothing, to do.」<br/>
It seemed she had spare time.<br/>
「How amazing. Liliana is now experiencing by myself that "spare time" I heard from rumors.」<br/>
It seemed she really had spare time. To the degree that she narrated the present condition of herself by herself.<br/>
For Liliana who was born as royalty, what was called "spare time" was the same as a fairytale.<br/>
After all, she was the sole direct descendant of the royalty until her little brother was born. She began going through education for the gifted ever since she was old enough to be aware of her surroundings, and even when Randell was born and her possibility to ascend to the throne decreased, the necessity for her to receive much training in her role as a spare, or in order to function as a rope toward the empire, didn’t decrease at all.<br/>
And then, when she was in her youth at the age of fourteen, she went through a year of a chain of events that was like surging waves, to which the word dense wasn’t enough at all to express that experience. And after that, she was swamped with work for the sake of the reconstruction.<br/>
From the time since she was born until the moment before this, she was in a position that was understandable for her to never experience this thing called "free time" or the like.<br/>
That was how Liliana was before, but then she was taken away by Hajime, had her official papers made in forgery, deceived the administrative official, obtained social status peacefully by slapping public safety in the face, and currently, she was going to the same college as Hajime and the others.<br/>
Before this, she had been taken to visit Earth several times, so she understood that earth was a world that was like a jack-in-the-box. Even so, the "school life" and "learning experience of another world’s college" that Liliana yearned for tickled her curious mind and gave her fresh enjoyment. It was, but……<br/>
Whirl whirl. Whirly whirl. The princess of another world was rotating in twirls using the chair of another world. And then, she came to a stop,<br/>
「……Davis-kun. It’s nice to be you huh. You look busy quivering.」<br/>
Finally, the princess started talking to a doll. Davis-kun quivered back and forth looking troubled.<br/>
But, at that time, the sound of the entrance opening could be heard faintly.<br/>
If Liliana had animal ears growing in her head, then right now they would surely be snapped up in attention *pikon*. She wore her indoor slippers and exited her room with rhythmical steps *te-te-te―* in order to welcome the person returning home.<br/>
She went down to the first floor and encountered Sumire who was holding a large quantity of bags, for some reason.<br/>
「Welcome home, Sumire-okaasama.」(TN: The kanji for okaa-sama(honored mother) here is written with the kanji of mother-in-law)<br/>
「My, you are home early today, Lily-chan. I’m home!」<br/>
Sumire fixed her hold on the large amount of bags with a rough huff before Liliana went to help her in a hurry. She took several of the baggage, and when she glanced inside them, it seemed their contents was a large number of side dishes.<br/>
「Say, Sumire-okaasama, this is?」<br/>
「You see, this is today’s dinner.」<br/>
「Dinner?」<br/>
「Yes. The dishes that were served in the event had leftovers, and I pilfered them all! They were really delicious. I heard that they called a really famous cook to make the dishes. So I thought that I should let my uncute son and his cute wives to try them.」<br/>
「Is, is that so. Thank you very much, Sumire-okaasama.」<br/>
「Your welcome!」<br/>
Liliana’s expression crumbled softly seeing her mother-in-law who was all smiles.<br/>
Frankly speaking, this is Sumire they were talking about, so she surely must have forcefully swiped the dishes for "takeout" without even minding the eyes of others drawing away from her. If not, normally someone would stop anyone from bringing home this much.<br/>
It seemed that today there was an event for the live-action film of the manga that was authored by Sumire, so the people there too must be only looking at Sumire who was packing up the food happily while thinking「No way we can anger sensei at this event huuh~」.<br/>
The Nagumo Family was in prosperity.<br/>
Sumire herself was a big name shoujo manga artist, and her husband Shuu had made his company bigger in these few years. And above all, the businesses that Hajime reached out his hand toward here and there were making absurd killings.<br/>
From the standpoint of royalty, it wasn’t like Liliana didn’t think that they had the allowance, so they could just directly employ that chef to cook directly for them.<br/>
But, no matter how much they were earning, no matter how prosperous they were, displaying a dynamism that was not forgetting this kind of "fun" was the shared trait of the Nagumo family. It was a tacit precept of the family.<br/>
Liliana became really ticklish seeing Sumire who showed off the dishes「I came with the delicious cooking that I snatched off――!」for the sake of herself who was a daughter-in-law.<br/>
They carried the large number of dishes to the kitchen before Sumire tilted her head「Come to think of it」while speaking out her question.<br/>
「You aren’t together with Hajime and the others?」<br/>
「Yes. Hajime-san and the others still have a lecture, so they are still at the college. The lecture that I was scheduled to have canceled……」<br/>
「My, that’s nice. Doesn’t a sudden lecture cancellation make you happy for no reason?」<br/>
「Eh? Eer……」<br/>
It seemed that Sumire’s common feeling wasn’t transmitted to the serious and diligent princess. After all, this princess was someone that would start talking to a quivering doll when she had too much free time.<br/>
「Or rather, even if you didn’t come home, you could’ve just gone to the lecture that Hajime is going to. Even just chattering aimlessly will be fun, right?」<br/>
「No, Sumire-okaasama. As expected, thinking that it’s fine to chatter while receiving a lecture is just……」<br/>
「Eeh~. It’s fun exactly because you are doing it secretly behind the teacher’s back.」<br/>
「Sumire-okaasama……」<br/>
Liliana’s shoulders dropped in dejection. Her blood-related mother Luluaria was fundamentally a sincere character that was strict and diligent to herself. And so, Liliana couldn’t say anything anymore to the irresponsible statement of her mother-in-law whose sense of value was completely different with her real mother.<br/>
But mysteriously, the relationship between Sumire and Luluaria was good despite this, which was why it was something mysterious.<br/>
They put down the dishes for the evening dinner with a thud in the kitchen. Sumire was moving the many dishes that were her war booty while she threw her gaze to Liliana who was helping her serving the food with similar nimbleness.<br/>
「And, how are you recently? Have you gotten used to this world? At the time when you only just came, you spent all your time studying various things, but recently you aren’t like that anymore.」<br/>
「Yes. I have grasped Earth’s affairs in general. The economics and politics, the religion and history, the situation of every nation, culture, fashion……every book in this world is compiled systematically, and even if there is something I don’t understand I can investigate it immediately using the internet. It’s really convenient.」<br/>
「Aa~, yeah, I see.」<br/>
「Yes. Especially the more I learned about economics and the study of statistics, the more I feel how deep they are. The density and the fruits of labor that has been accumulated by the predecessors of this world are something that I cannot find in Tortus. Every day, I feel like I am shown just how behind the study of the world other there is compared to here.」<br/>
「I, I see. How amazing~」<br/>
「Yes. Right now, over there they are still in the middle of reconstruction, so even if an advanced system is suddenly introduced, I can see that it will only end in failure. It won’t be able to happen right away, but someday, I believe that the kingdom has to adopt this. Regarding the field of economy, the coordination with Fhuren――」<br/>
「St, stop! Sto~~~~~p! That’s enough there, Lily-chan!」<br/>
「Heh?」<br/>
Sumire hurriedly raised her voice to stop Liliana who was spouting a torrent of speech.<br/>
Liliana was lifting her face in puzzlement, but even now, her hands were moving continuously without pause and served up the packed dishes as though they were palace cooking. Her speed was twice Sumire’s while her courteousness was triple.<br/>
「Geez, Lily-chan, even though you should have left the position of the princess and came into the family when you are talking about your mind, you are only talking about the kingdom.」<br/>
「a……」<br/>
Liliana finally noticed herself what she was talking about after getting stared at by Sumire’s half-admiring half-exasperated face. Her cheeks reddened.<br/>
「When you just arrived here, you felt like ‘Everything attracts my interest, so there is no time for that!’, but when you calmed down after grasping the situation to a degree, as expected, you become concerned with your homeland, don’t you?」<br/>
「N, no, such a thing……is not true.」<br/>
Seeing Liliana who stuttered, Sumire put her index finger on her chin muttering「Uu~n」in a thinking gesture before she spoke something that was shocking for Liliana.<br/>
「Is that so? But recently, Lily-chan is making a face that looks like a lost child somehow you know?」<br/>
「Eh……」<br/>
Sumire walked toward Liliana who was staring at her in blank amazement with her eyes turned round, and then she stooped down a bit to put their eyes at the same height. And then, after Sumire confirmed that those blue eyes were reflecting herself properly, she asked calmly with a gentle and kind expression.<br/>
「Do you want to return home?」<br/>
It was a gentle voice that was filled with concern and sympathy toward Liliana without any blaming tone in it.<br/>
For a moment, the questioned Lily showed an expression that didn’t understand what the meaning of the question was. But right after that, she unconsciously raised her voice.<br/>
「I’m not thinking anything like that!」<br/>
「Wawah, wait Lily-chan, calm down.」<br/>
「Sumire-okaasama, it’s true! I’m not thinking of going home or anything! I’m not feeling any discomfort or dissatisfaction! I love everyone! I’m happy I can come here! It’s true!」<br/>
「I get it, I get it already!」<br/>
Sumire spontaneously hugged Lily tightly.<br/>
It seemed that Liliana jumped to the wrong conclusion thinking that Sumire’s question had the implicit meaning of「If you are dissatisfied with the life here, perhaps it’s better to go home?」<br/>
Of course, Sumire didn’t mean anything like that. She was only concernedly thinking「Perhaps she is slowly getting homesick?」, thinking that anyone would be driven by their feelings for their homeland. She wouldn’t say anything like ‘go home’ even if she got her mouth ripped open.<br/>
Because, Sumire’s feeling toward Liliana was,<br/>
「A princess! The real thing! From another world! Just who would let you go! Fuhehe, everyone in the world! How can this be, this lovely princess-chan, she is my daughter! Thank you very much! Dyufu, dyufufu」<br/>
It was fixated like that.<br/>
Liliana, who knew nothing about that, was tightly embraced against Sumire’s chest and guessed that she was misunderstanding and her cheeks reddened once more.<br/>
「I’m sorry, Lily-chan. Looks like I’m off the mark.」<br/>
「No, it was me who jumped to the wrong conclusion……thank you very much for worrying about me.」<br/>
「I’m your mother. Isn’t it natural for me to be worried about my daughter? If there is something, then don’t be reserved at all and consult me, okay?」<br/>
「Yes-」<br/>
Liliana smiled softly at the gentle hand of the mother-in-law that was caressing her head. And then, they began moving the dishes on to the plates once more. Liliana didn’t even suspect that inside her heart, Sumire was jumping in joy thinking「No good-, the destructive power of a genuine princess’s smile is extraordinary yaa~~!!」<br/>
After that, Liliana was enjoying tea with the kind mother-in-law until Hajime and co returned home.<br/>
A lively family.<br/>
A quiet time with the beloved people.<br/>
Liliana was feeling the happiness she hoped for. There wasn’t any falsehood in it.<br/>
However, for some reason, Sumire’s words were remaining inside her head, and it didn’t vanish, like a small bone that got stuck in her throat. It caused her to have a feeling that she couldn’t express in words.<br/>
 <br/>
 <br/>
That night. Liliana, who returned to her room, had finished all her preparations to retire to bed; however, she didn’t lie on the bed and sat on the swivel chair while being in a daze.<br/>
The words「Like a lost child」from that afternoon were replayed many times over inside her head.<br/>
When she suddenly dropped her gaze, there was the unmoving Davis-kun there. It was unmoving without even a twitch with an expression that was like it was going to raise an American laugh「HA―――-, HAHAHAHA-」anytime now.<br/>
「――O wind」<br/>
Liliana spoke a verse of chant. Immediately, a breeze flowed, and Davis-kun started to move *shiver shiver, tremble tremble* as though it came to life. It was really comical. As though it was making fun of Liliana who was even now harboring a mist that couldn’t clear up.<br/>
「……Damn you, Davis-kun.」<br/>
She tried hurling abuse with a tone that was out of the norm for her. Hurling abuse when it moved even though she was the one moving it herself, it seemed that Liliana was considerably "loosening".<br/>
But, at that time, a knocking sound suddenly rang out. Liliana twitched, and in shock, she replied even while her voice slightly turned shrill.<br/>
Like that, the one who entered was Hajime.<br/>
「Yo, can I bother you a bit?」<br/>
「Ye, yes. No need to say a bit, please feel free to do as you please. But, there will be a lecture first thing in the morning, so if I can possibly be let to sleep by the early hours……」<br/>
「This isn’t night crawling. Or rather, you think I’m a really frivolous guy that will say something like "let me do it a bit" huh.」<br/>
Hajime smiled wryly at Liliana who was in a thorough misunderstanding while retorting. And then, he sat down on the bed and directed his gaze at Liliana who was red-faced from her misunderstanding.<br/>
「Well, it’s also not something as big as a business or anything though……how are you doing lately?」<br/>
「……Fufu. I was also asked that this afternoon by Sumire-okaasama. Do I really look that unusual I wonder?」<br/>
Seeing how the mother and son were equally worried about her caused Liliana to leak out a chuckle of amusement.<br/>
Hajime scratched his cheek awkwardly while answering.<br/>
「You aren’t acting unusual or anything. It’s just; it’s the fact that you look like you aren’t energetic. And from that, it looks like you are gloomy because it seems that Lily yourself doesn’t understand just why you aren’t energetic.」<br/>
Liliana felt a ticklish feeling ‘he really is looking properly at me huuh’ while she hugged her knees on the chair. Her figure that turned small on the chair with only her toes peeking out from her largish and loose negligee was really charming.<br/>
「Thank you very much for worrying about me.」<br/>
「What are you saying. I’m your husband you know? It’s obvious for the husband to worry for his wife.」<br/>
Once again it was a similar line from the mother and son. This time Liliana became so excessively amused that she chuckled a bit louder.<br/>
「I’m fine, Hajime-san. Really, it’s only that sometimes I felt a bit gloomy. It’s nothing big at all.」<br/>
Hajime sighed at Liliana who was saying such a thing. And then, he suddenly stood up and lifted up Liliana in a princess carry.<br/>
Hajime sat down once more on the bed. However, this time he put Liliana on his lap in his arms.<br/>
「Err, Hajime-san? As I thought, yo, you will do it?」<br/>
「I’m not gonna. The inside of Lily’s head is unexpectedly pink colored huh. No, perhaps it’s not unexpected. In the first place, you have a hobby of creating delusions.」<br/>
Liliana’s cheeks reddened with her hand on her own clothes. Hajime directed a warm gaze at her. Liliana turned sulky.<br/>
「Don’t sulk like that. Recently, I’m bothered. I’m asking not for Lily, but because I want to know. Listen to your husband’s request.」<br/>
「u. That way of talking is not fair.」<br/>
Liliana groaned in a small voice.<br/>
And then, strength left her body as though she was giving up, and she began to talk about her emotions lately that she herself wasn’t clear about.<br/>
According to her, the time she spent in the Nagumo family was really happy.<br/>
According to her, the lecture at the college was also really interesting.<br/>
According to her, there was nothing more easeful for her heart than this situation where she could play, learn about what she likes, and having a day where she didn’t do anything.<br/>
According to her, right now, she was living just like in her dreams, without any anxiety or pressure, spending happy days being surrounded by her beloved people.<br/>
According to her, every day was really meaningful.<br/>
The more she talked, the more it felt like there wasn’t any problem. But, Hajime’s expression, who was staring fixedly at the talking Liliana, was gradually turning amazed, no, to speak more accurately there was a color of exasperation that was starting to dwell in that expression.<br/>
If asked why his expression was like that, it was because even though Liliana should be talking about happy things, her expression looked vaguely unsatisfied.<br/>
Liliana didn’t notice Hajime’s expression that was like that, and in the end, she summed up her own feeling.<br/>
「Most likely, I’m lacking in an objective inside myself. Surely, what I ought to do is find a great objective and devote myself to it just like Hajime-san and the others who are doing their best in order to manage the businesses. Yes, that must be it. It feels like I can see it while I was talking. For the time being, I’ll learn economics to the end because it will be useful in the futu――」<br/>
「No, that’s not it.」<br/>
Liliana finally looked up to Hajime after getting interrupted midway. And then she noticed. That Hajime’s face, for some reason, was absurdly exasperated!?<br/>
「Ha, Hajime-san? Did I, say something strange?」<br/>
「Aa~, yep, what to say. You are strange. Especially in your head.」<br/>
「That’s cruel-!? That’s an unthinkable abuse! Just where is it in me that is strange!?」<br/>
As expected, Liliana couldn’t forgive Hajime’s abusive language, and she snapped angrily while questioning him. It caused Hajime’s expression to turn speechless.<br/>
Liliana guessed that somehow Hajime had noticed something that she didn’t notice herself. So she waited for an answer even while puffing up her cheeks.<br/>
Hajime suddenly stood up and the, he casually tossed Liliana on the bed. Liliana bounced *poyon* and looked up at Hajime in a girl’s sitting posture.<br/>
「Listen well, I’ll say it starting from the conclusion. The true identity of your gloominess is "insufficientness".」<br/>
「Err……that’s why, I said that I’d find an objective and work hard.」<br/>
「No, that’s not it. Even if you do that, you won’t be satisfied. It won’t be enough at all. Your murky feelings won’t get cleared up for even a bit. I can guarantee it.」<br/>
「Ee~. Then, what is it that you mean?」<br/>
Liliana tilted her head in wonder as though asking ‘In the end, what is it that you want to say?’. Hajime opened his mouth while looking like he got a headache, as though this was something unexpected.<br/>
「Work that is forced on you.」<br/>
「Yes?」<br/>
「Approaching deadline.」<br/>
「Err……」<br/>
「Cases that cause stomachaches. Tremendous pressure.」<br/>
「Excuse me~, Hajime-san? What are you……」<br/>
「A problem where running away is not permitted. The word responsibility that crosses the mind.」<br/>
「A, are you listening, Hajime-san?」<br/>
「The mountain of paperwork that is piled up mercilessly despite you being on your last legs already from lack of sleep.」<br/>
「……」<br/>
Liliana finally fell silent before Hajime yelled as though to deal the finishing blow.<br/>
「Work, work, work-, so much so that you are literally "swamped with work"!! A work with a grave responsibility that you feel like vomiting-!!」<br/>
「………………kufuh」<br/>
Liliana twitched. She looked around while saying「Just now, did you hear some kind of strange laugh?」. Naturally, there was no one inside the room except Hajime who was standing imposingly and the quivering Davis-kun.<br/>
「No, it was you just now, you.」<br/>
「Eh? What do you mean me……」<br/>
The gaze of Hajime whose hypothesis had turned into conviction, it now had gone past exasperation and turned instead into pity while his hand took a mirror that was on the table.<br/>
「Lily. Try to confirm, just what kind of face you are making right now.」<br/>
「Hajime-san’s words and actions are cryptic since some time ago though……」<br/>
Even while saying that, Liliana obediently accepted the mirror then looked at her own face and――she stiffened.<br/>
That was understandable.<br/>
After all, in the mirror, there was an incomprehensible expression that was scowling in displeasure, yet even so, for some reason, the eyes of that expression were blazing fierily while a fearless smile was merging on the lips. If it was said without any dressing up, then it was a really creepy expression. And that expression was pasted on her own face!<br/>
Liliana tilted her head thinking「Dear me? By any chance, is there another world inside the mirror?」while she tried knocking on the mirror, turning it upside down while waving it around. But no matter what the creepy Lily there wouldn’t disappear.<br/>
Liliana stared at her own face for a while before she suddenly tossed away the mirror *pei-*. And then she turned her gaze at Hajime while putting her face between her hands.<br/>
「Ha, Hajime-san! Just what have you done to me! It’s cruel that you make my face turn like this!」<br/>
「I ain’t doing anything. It’s only Lily’s real nature surfacing on your face.」<br/>
「What do you mean with real nature!?」<br/>
For the time being, Liliana laid the blame of her terrible face on Hajime, but Hajime then pointed his finger with a snap at her.<br/>
‘What does real nature mean? If you don’t understand, then I’ll tell you.’<br/>
With eyes glinting like a detective cornering the criminal, Hajime exposed the truth to the world!<br/>
「Lily. You are――a genuine, and what’s more it’s at a super level, or rather it’s at abnormal pervert level, WORKAHOLIC!」(TN: Here Hajime said it in Japanese English, wookaahorikku)<br/>
「WHA, WHAT DID YOU SAY―――!! ……No, wookaa……what is that?」<br/>
Liliana tried to get shocked following the mood, but she then tilted her head at the vocabulary that she heard for the first time.<br/>
「It refers to work addiction. First on the list is work, second is work, third and fourth is also work with work in the fifth. Personal life? What’s that, is it delicious? Hobby? It’s work; you got a problem? It refers to that type of person. Furthermore, in Lily’s case, it doesn’t apply to mere normal work. You aren’t able to feel sufficient anymore unless it’s something forced on you, with heavy responsibility, and its quality and quantity are in super hard mode. You are a work addict on an abnormal pervert level.」<br/>
「E, ee!? Yo, you are wrong! Rather, I actually hate working!」<br/>
「……Actually, recently there is this case where friction is appearing which concerns the public safety, and there might even be dead victims coming if the discussion fails. Lily, I’m thinking of leaving it to Lily――」<br/>
「Eh!?」<br/>
Lily-chan’s eyes were sparkling brightly.<br/>
Hajime quickly picked up the mirror that was thrown *pei-* just now and thrust it in front of Liliana. It entered her eyes, the sight of her own face with an incomprehensible expression that looked displeased while also looking delighted. In a sense, it was an expression with a superb harmony between the two emotions.<br/>
「My, my real nature is, a workaholic……what’s more it’s at an abnormal pervert level……」<br/>
Liliana crumbled down. She fell from the bed, and then she trembled *quiver quiver* just like Davis-kun while her eyes were losing focus.<br/>
Even though she should have gotten away from the duty of royalty and crossed over worlds to chase the happiness as a normal girl, as expected, it was insufficient when she didn’t have any duties……<br/>
However, when it was pointed out to her like this, then certainly it was exactly like that. Even when she obtained the knowledge for living, even when she strived to study at the university, even when she built new human relations, and even when she went somewhere and did something, all of those were for her own sake.<br/>
No matter what happened, the consequence would only affect herself. When she failed, there wouldn’t be any considerable loss or anything. Even if, for example, an unexpected situation that surpassed the acceptable range occurred, in front of her new family, everything would be nothing more than a trifling matter.<br/>
It was truly a life of Easy Mode.<br/>
Compared to standing at the top of a country, leading the people, and fighting a mighty enemy, this life was truly, truly……<br/>
――Lukewarm<br/>
「Hau!?」<br/>
「O, oi, Lily? Are you okay?」<br/>
The feeling toward her life on Earth that was spontaneously welling up inside her caused Lily to crouch down with her hands pressing on her chest.<br/>
――Liliana S. B. Hairihi, 17 years old. The princess of the Hairihi Kingdom.<br/>
Since she was born, she had been continuously immersed in "things that must be done no matter what". From that, her body had become something that couldn’t be satisfied with "things that she can choose and want to do herself"!<br/>
Give more work! Work that troubles the mind so much it feels like the head’s blood vessel will burst! Pressing problems that are nothing but excessive-. Paperwork that is piling up like a mountain range, that makes you hallucinate like it won’t end for eternity-!<br/>
「I’m not that kind of dangerous woma―――n-!!」<br/>
「Oooi-. Seriously, are you okay, Lily!?」<br/>
Liliana held her head while writhing around due to her real nature. Even while feeling creeped out, Hajime went to soothe her somehow.<br/>
Thirty minutes later.<br/>
Liliana, who calmed down somehow, was now sitting while hugging her knees feeling dejected. While she was like that, Hajime folded his arms and wracked his brain「H~m」.<br/>
「……Hajime-san. Perhaps it’s better if I go home.」<br/>
「Hm? I somehow understand what you are thinking, but why?」<br/>
Liliana’s body was stirring restlessly; she raised her chin that was put on her raised knees and spoke with a complicated sulky expression.<br/>
「As I thought, no matter where I go, I’m still a princess. No matter what I do, in the end, I’ll summarize it into the point whether it will become advantageous for the kingdom or not. And then, the "insufficientness" in Earth, it caused me to trouble Hajime-san and Sumire-okaasan like now.」<br/>
Her shoulders drooped, and she delicately muttered something incomprehensible「Someone like me after all, is just a princess that cannot become a normal girl」.<br/>
Hajime smiled wryly while answering.<br/>
「Well, whether you are going home or remaining here, it doesn’t really matter which one you are going to choose though.」<br/>
「That’s cruel-!? Is that something you can say to your wife!?」<br/>
Hajime’s wry smile deepened saying「I’m joking」at the enraged Liliana while he continued speaking.<br/>
「Look here, I understood from the start that you could not stop being a princess, you remember? Your princess level is a bit above my expectation but……if you want to do work as royalty, then I won’t stop you. If Lily wishes for it, then I’ll make it so you can even come and go there from here every day. I’ll need to concentrate a bit and improve the gate, but……well, I’ll manage somehow. That’s why don’t say you are going home looking desperate like that.」<br/>
「Hajime-san……」<br/>
Of course, Liliana herself also didn’t seriously say that she was going home. But, as expected, it was something joyful to be told「Don’t go」by her beloved like this.<br/>
Hajime continued talking to Liliana whose cheeks loosened up.<br/>
「I told you this several times already, but Lily, speak more selfishly. After all, no matter what kind of impossible demand it is, I’ll do it somehow.」<br/>
「……yes.」<br/>
Hajime said that while patting her head gently. Liliana’s body trembled as though she was in anguish. Her eyes were starting to carry heat. Hajime averted his gaze from such a Liliana and returned to the talk.<br/>
「And so. Becoming a commuting princess is also one way……」<br/>
「Commuting princess……it’s the first time I heard that kind of vocabulary. But, I have the feeling that like that. in the end. I’ll be swamped with work where I cannot stop even if I want to stop.」<br/>
「Yeah, I also think so. And so, how about doing work other than the work of the royalty? Even though I said that you will still get swamped with work, all the same, so you will be moderately busy doing things with moderate responsibility, like that little by little you will get used to "moderate work", and eventually your body and heart will get accustomed with "enjoying free time". Something like that.」<br/>
「So it’s like, a rehabilitation then. I somewhat feel complicated……」<br/>
‘Am I a sick person, ah, I’m an addict……’ Liliana made a complicated expression with that thought. Hajime then suggested to Liliana whether he should leave several businesses for her to manage.<br/>
Liliana pondered for a little before she shook her head.<br/>
「No, I’ll refrain from work where I act as Hajime-san’s representative. I know that even by doing anything else I’ll still have the sense of security that everything will be fine no matter what happens, but even so, I believe that doing work that is unrelated with Hajime-san for my first rehabilitation will be just right.」<br/>
「Hm~m? Is that so. However, in that case, what will you do then?」<br/>
Liliana suddenly stood up, and while bouncing *poyon* on the bed, she thrust up her fist and proclaimed.<br/>
「Yes, I decided. I’ll do part-time work!」<br/>
Honestly, it wasn’t like Hajime wasn’t thinking「Is it fine doing part-time work?」, but it seemed better for Liliana to be in a place where she didn’t have the backing of Hajime, so he didn’t really say anything.<br/>
And then, Liliana said「My aim, is to be a normal girl! I won’t let anyone say that I’m a workaholic anymore!」with rough breathing from her boiling up motivation while Hajime was giving her a noncommittal applause「Oo, do your best~」.<br/>
