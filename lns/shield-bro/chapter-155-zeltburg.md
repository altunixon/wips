Chapter 155:  Zeltbur<br/>
As I leave Rat’s lab, I notice the Slave Dealer’s carriage parked nearby.<br/>
"If it isn’t the Hero of the Shield!" (Slave Dealer)<br/>
I’ve been seeing him a lot lately.<br/>
But I’ve given him the important duty of finding this village’s former villagers, so I guess there’s no helping it.<br/>
I don’t really like dealing with him, though.<br/>
"Did you find more slaves or something?" (Naofumi)<br/>
"No! I haven’t done anything of the sort. Yes." (Slave Dealer)<br/>
"Why are you here!? Go home!" (Naofumi)<br/>
Should I throw salt at him?<br/>
If he says that he came here to eat, then I’ll smack him.<br/>
By the way, salt isn’t particularly valuable here, as we’re right next to the ocean.<br/>
"Can I not stop by without a reason? Your treatment makes my heart race." (Slave Dealer)<br/>
"You seem to have the intention of making me into your chef." (Naofumi)<br/>
"Ah, by the way that was a joke. Yes." (Slave Dealer)<br/>
"Are you picking a fight?" (Naofumi)<br/>
"No, no. I came here to ask something of the hero of the Shield." (Slave Dealer)<br/>
"… Ask something?" (Naofumi)<br/>
The Slave dealer is raising his voice. He’s trying to make it out as a big deal.<br/>
I bet he’s up to no good again.<br/>
"I need you to go to Zeltbur to buy slaves." (Slave Dealer)<br/>
"Buy slaves…" (Naofumi)<br/>
"My relative has voiced a desire to sell some of his finest slaves to you." (Slave Dealer)<br/>
"At a discount, right?" (Naofumi)<br/>
"He’s offering you the best of the best." (Slave Dealer)<br/>
"That sounds expensive." (Naofumi)<br/>
It’s not like I’m interested in purchasing expensive slaves.<br/>
My main priority is to gather Rafatalia’s friends.<br/>
From what I’ve seen so far, this village’s villagers are going for quite cheap.<br/>
As they’re children, their base levels were quite low. And in terms of stats, they were well below those desired for manual labor.<br/>
"We will make sure that they are within a price range even you can afford." (Slave Dealer)<br/>
"Well, I do have some spare change…" (Naofumi)<br/>
I’m earning a bit from selling the Bioplant fruit, and monster materials that Kiel and the others are collecting while hunting. Right now, the village has little financial difficulty.<br/>
It’s almost time for me to stop by the Old Man to stock up on weapons.<br/>
The villages has also improved greatly over time.<br/>
I think things will work out even if I’m absent for a bit.<br/>
Even if I stop cooking for a while…<br/>
… the only reason I have to cook now is because everyone makes a commotion if I don’t.<br/>
"How long will the trip take?" (NAofumi)<br/>
"Let’s see… Normally, a boat would be fastest, but on your prided Filo Rial’s legs it should be around 3 days." (Slave Dealer)<br/>
3 Days, even on Firo. It must be quite far.<br/>
Well, it’s another country so I guess that goes without saying.<br/>
I think I heard the other heroes say that the weapons from Zeltbur were quite potent, or something.<br/>
So those guys have been there already.<br/>
Is that why their levels were so high?<br/>
They had obtained excellent weapons?<br/>
There are plenty of weapons in their possession that I know nothing about.<br/>
Like the Flashing sword, the Thunder Shooter, and the Portal Spear<br/>
I have no idea what weapons would give those skills.<br/>
This is one thing I have to ask next I see them.<br/>
Though I don’t think they’ll tell me.<br/>
"How long by boat?" (Naofumi)<br/>
"4 days." (Slave Dealer)<br/>
"Fumu…" (Naofumi)<br/>
I glance at the villagers.<br/>
Everyone is earnestly working towards reconstruction.<br/>
Imya is working with the Dunes to dig a hole.<br/>
Because she is a mole, it looks quite fitting.<br/>
Rafatalia is lecturing on peddling, and Firo is taking a nap.<br/>
Rishia and Kiel are learning swordsmanship from Female Knight.<br/>
Other slaves who have decided to fight are getting drilled from the soldiers.<br/>
I guess I can leave the village be for a week.<br/>
"Then I guess we should go." (Naofumi)<br/>
"I thought you would say as such." (Slave Dealer)<br/>
"Rafatalia, Firo, Everyone Else, please gather here for a second." (Naofumi)<br/>
I call everybody here.<br/>
"I’ll be away for around one week. The people accompanying me will be Rafatalia, Firo and…" (Naofumi)<br/>
Who should O take?<br/>
I think Itsuki had been witnessed in that area.<br/>
… Should I take Rishia?<br/>
"Rishia, want to come?" (Naofumi)<br/>
"Yes!" (Rishia)<br/>
"Kiel, please take care of Rishia’s duties while she’s away." (Naofumi)<br/>
"Understood, Nii-chan." (Kiel)<br/>
"Don’t get too carried away." (Naofumi)<br/>
"I-I got it." (Kiel)<br/>
Rishia and Kiel have different ways of working. Of the two, Rishia is more skilled at raising her level.<br/>
She’s a bit more like a leader. I guess a Jack of All Trades is good at covering for the faults of a team.<br/>
People like Firo just take out enemies with powerful attacks, so nothing can really be learned from them.<br/>
The one truly teaching the slaves to fight is Rishia.<br/>
I’m a bit nervous leaving that spot to Kiel.<br/>
She can be quite rash at times.<br/>
"If anything happens, go to the medicine shop in the neighboring village. Otherwise, get the people who specialize in healing magic to help." (Naofumi)<br/>
The Magic Shopkeeper came here and told people what their magic specialties were, so now quite a few people have started to learn basic spells.<br/>
I think nothing will happen in just a week…<br/>
"And… you." (Naofumi)<br/>
I stare at Taniko and think.<br/>
"Don’t fight too much with Rat over monsters." (Naofumi)<br/>
"The old lady is doing mean things to them." (Taniko)<br/>
This girl likes monsters way too much.<br/>
How exactly was she raised?<br/>
I should ask her sometime.<br/>
"Ah, right. Kiel, try hunting with Rat at some point in time." (Naofumi)<br/>
"Hm? Sure, but why?" (Kiel)<br/>
"That women incapacitated Firo in an instant. She should have quite some skill, and she is quite knowledgeable on monsters." (Naofumi)<br/>
"Got it." (Kiel)<br/>
"Should I report to the Queen that Iwatani is going to Zeltbur?" (Female Knight)<br/>
Female Knight speakes up.<br/>
"It’s not like I’ll be causing any problems." (Naofumi)<br/>
"Understood. I’m sure the Queen will permit it. We aren’t on bad terms with that country." (Female Knight)<br/>
"Oh, and keep up surveillance on Rat." (Naofumi)<br/>
"Understood." (Female Knight)<br/>
"… Is there anything I’m forgetting? No? Then let’s go." (Naofumi)<br/>
And that’s how, following the Slave Dealer’s words, we set off for Zeltbur.<br/>
By the way, two of the Slave Dealer’s men had hooked up his carriage to ours when we weren’t looking.<br/>
"Wow, it sure is fast." (Slave Dealer)<br/>
"Well, yeah…" (Naofumi)<br/>
"And I also feel a little Sick. Yes." (Slave Dealer)<br/>
Though he is smiling, his face is pale. Is that really something to laugh about?<br/>
The men that came with the Slave dealer are already vomiting.<br/>
If you aren’t used to it, it is near impossible to ride Firo’s carriage for long periods of time. We aren’t travelling on paved roads, so the carriages are swaying.<br/>
I wonder just how fast Firo is running anyways.<br/>
It’s definitely fast, but…<br/>
"Ahahahahahahahahahah… This is fun!" (Firo)<br/>
Firo is laughing dangerously.<br/>
I hope we haven’t been jinxed.<br/>
Is running her instinct?<br/>
And in Three days, we crossed the border without any harm and headed into Zeltbur.<br/>
"It’s quite a busy place." (Naofumi)<br/>
Business is thriving here much more so than in Melromark’s Castle Town. It is also much more crowded<br/>
My face isn’t widely known here, so no one says anything to me.<br/>
"What sort of country is Zeltbur? I just realized I know absolutely nothing about it." (Naofumi)<br/>
"Then let me explain." (Slave Dealer)<br/>
The Slave dealer begins speaking with enthusiasm.<br/>
"Zeltbur, the country of mercenaries. Just as its name implies, this country is populated largely by mercenary organizations." (Slave Dealer)<br/>
"Well, that sound self-evident." (Naofumi)<br/>
"Do you know about Swords for Hire? There people make money by selling their strength to others. The adventurer’s guild has deep ties to this country. This makes industries such as Weapon Shops and Medicine Shops prosper as well. It’s a country in which an unbelievable amount of money circulates." (Slave Dealer)<br/>
"It sure does seem lively." (Naofumi)<br/>
I peer outside of the carriage.<br/>
You can feel some energy from the Castle Town’s residents, but the feeling here is overpowering.<br/>
Whether it be the shopping district or the slums, the people here seem to move with more energy than those in Melromark.<br/>
"By the way, this country has no monarchy. It is ruled by a council of merchants." (Slave Dealer)"<br/>
"Hmm…" (Naofumi)<br/>
So it’s like a Republic.<br/>
Well I guess a country of Mercenaries wouldn’t care for monarchy. All that matters is ability.<br/>
"This country also has a dark history involving constant warfare, so you should caution yourself." (Slave Dealer)<br/>
"I know." (Naofumi)<br/>
"My clan has set up a base here. We are partaking in quite a profit." (Slave Dealer)<br/>
"… As I thought." (Naofumi)<br/>
How should I say this, yesterday I had a nightmare.<br/>
I was surrounded by thousands of people that looked exactly like the Slave Dealer. They tried to sell me things.<br/>
"And the most famous attraction of the Country is its Coliseum." (Slave Dealer)<br/>
"Coliseum?" (Naofumi)<br/>
A fighting arena. (TL: Coliseum is said in english)<br/>
Brawlers fight against one another, and people place bets.<br/>
"It’s this country’s trademark. Perhaps the Hero will want to visit as well." (Slave Dealer)<br/>
"I’ll consider it. Now where are we headed?" (Naofumi)<br/>
"Get off the main road, and go down that back alley." (Slave Dealer)<br/>
"Got it. Firo." (Naofumi)<br/>
We follow the Slave Dealer’s instruction and head down a back alley.<br/>
And then…<br/>
From somewhere, a rope is thrown at Firo’s neck.<br/>
"Hehehe, that’s quite a rare monster you got there!" (???)<br/>
Some Delinquent-esque men appear.<br/>
These people don’t know about Firo?<br/>
Well, I guess my wanted posters were only spread in Melromark, so they wouldn’t know.<br/>
Anyways, these people remind me of someone.<br/>
But their fate has already been sealed.<br/>
"Ya!" (Firo)<br/>
"GUHAAAAAA!?" (Delinquent-esque Male)<br/>
The person who threw the rope carelessly approaches Firo, only to get kicked.<br/>
… This sure is a barbaric country.<br/>
"W-what’s with this one! Quiet down! GUHA!?" (Delinquent-esque Male)<br/>
"It’s a wild one! Quick, Tye it up… NUGUGUUUUAAAA!?" (Delinquent-esque Male 2)<br/>
And Firo bites down on Idiot number 1’s head. (TL: She doesn’t eat it, just bites it like Sadaharu)<br/>
He thrashes around for a while, but finally gives up.<br/>
"I-it’s a monster!!!!!" (Delinquent-esque Male)<br/>
"Please save me!" (Delinquent-esque Male)<br/>
Firo drops the Delinquent, and then takes the rope off of her neck.<br/>
"I’d prefer them a bit more salty. Also, they don’t look too healthy." (Firo)<br/>
"…" (Delinquent-esque males.)<br/>
Firo really looks like she will eat them.<br/>
I hope she doesn’t start maturing in a strange direction.<br/>
"Firo, remember that Humans are not food." (Rafatalia)<br/>
"Hm?" (Firo)<br/>
Though she’s like this, she’s still a Filo Rial. Her base mental Capabilities are not that high.<br/>
It’s a pain. I would have preferred it if her intelligence was even lower.<br/>
"Firo, when it comes to people, Children are tastier. They’re softer." (Naofumi)<br/>
"Naofumi-sama, what are you teaching her!?" (Rafatalia)<br/>
In games and novels, monsters often use that line. I’ll try using it here.<br/>
But Firo shakes her head violently.<br/>
"No!" (Firo)<br/>
"Firo learns faster if you bring up children." (Naofumi)<br/>
"I’m not sure if she even learned anything or not…" (Rafatalia)<br/>
"Anyways, Firo. It’s better if you don’t act like you eat people, unless we’re threatening them." (Naofumi)<br/>
"Yeah. I thought I could get them to run away." (Firo)<br/>
So she understood what she was doing.<br/>
She’s picking up things surprisingly well.<br/>
It’s a pain if she gets too smart, but I guess she’s doing well.<br/>
"What was that about being salty?" (Naofumi)<br/>
"That’s what I felt when I licked him." (Firo)<br/>
… Let’s pray she hasn’t gotten a taste for humans.<br/>
We stop the Carriage at the Slave Dealer’s acquaintance’s house.<br/>
"Rishia, what will you do from here?" (Naofumi)<br/>
"I want to search for Itsuki-sama." (Rishia)<br/>
Rishia had been silent in thought for much of the journey. So this is the conclusion she has come to.<br/>
I already knew, but Rishia is still chasing after Itsuki.<br/>
The other heroes have had some of their comrades captured or killed. But there is no information on Itsuki.<br/>
From the beginning, there had been little information circulating about him anyways.<br/>
He tried to act like a hero and work under the radar.<br/>
"I understand. When night falls, we’ll meet up back at this carriage. Until then, you are free to act on your own." (Naofumi)<br/>
"G-got it." (Rishia)<br/>
"What about Firo?" (Firo)<br/>
"I’m a little worried about Rishia travelling alone, so please follow her." (Naofumi)<br/>
"Yes." (Firo)<br/>
I leave bodyguard duties to Firo, who is not in her human form.<br/>
Rishia has gotten strong, so I don’t really have to worry, but the chances of her getting wrapped up in something strange is not zero.<br/>
It doesn’t seem that this country keeps good public order.<br/>
"Also, Rishia." (Naofumi)<br/>
"What is it?" (Rishia)<br/>
"Take off the costume." (Naofumi)<br/>
"I-I know!" (Rishia)<br/>
Though she says that, it seems she had forgotten about it up until that point.<br/>
I want to believe that she had simply forgot about it, and hadn’t intended on walking through town dressed like that.<br/>
