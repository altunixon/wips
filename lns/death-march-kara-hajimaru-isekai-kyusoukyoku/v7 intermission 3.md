Intermission: Pochi's Secret<br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
Pochi will not forget.<br/>
<br/>
That day, the day I'm given name.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
◇<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
"Princess, we have come to escort you back."<br/>
<br/>
Two dogkin men who wear silver clothes are standing while being bathed in moonlight. The kind-looking long-haired man talked to me.<br/>
<br/>
"I do not have any intention to leave this planet."<br/>
"However, princess!"<br/>
"Please wait, Dober. First, let's hear the princess."<br/>
"However, Shiva!"<br/>
<br/>
The long-haired man stopped the red-haired man who was pressing on me.<br/>
<br/>
"Please tell us your reason. Is this savage planet more important than your home planet?"<br/>
"I have important companions here. And also, for the sake of the child in my stomach, I cannot leave this planet."<br/>
<br/>
She pats the stomach that looks inconspicuous while she's sitting on the chair. <br/>
<br/>
"That can't be, the miko of the great Ra Anubis to do something like having a child with the savage creature!"<br/>
"I, is that true princess?"<br/>
<br/>
I nod at the two who are panicking.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
◇<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Pochi will not forget.<br/>
<br/>
The taste of the first dried meat I eat. The happiness of grilled meat festival together with everyone.<br/>
<br/>
Absolutely never forget.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
◇<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
"Are you going no matter what?"<br/>
"Yes, I'm not the miko of Ra Anubis but Pochi Pendragon nano desu."<br/>
<br/>
Yes, this place is important, along with that person.<br/>
As long as there are these two holy magic swords that he has forged, I can't let something like demon lord to keep doing as it pleases.<br/>
<br/>
"We're also going together okay?"<br/>
"One for all~?"<br/>
<br/>
Karina and Tama stand in my way when I'm about to depart.<br/>
We exchange high fives just like we've done in the battlefield a long time ago.<br/>
<br/>
Now, let's board the world tree ship that Mia has prepared and embark toward hell!<br/>
<br/>
Liza, please watch over us from beyond the star. We will surely take on your opponent.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
◇<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
"Hou?　I have died in it huh?"<br/>
"Au, don't look nodesu. Prohibited nano desu."<br/>
<br/>
Liza saw the written story that I wrote together with Arisa nodesu.<br/>
<br/>
"Even Pochi didn't want to have you died nodesu. But, but, Arisa is."<br/>
"Is that so, Pochi is laying the blame on Arisa huh."<br/>
"Au, au, I'm not nodesu, I'm not nodesu~"<br/>
<br/>
When we were debating who was going to die, we did it inadvertently nodesu. I'm reflecting on it, so please forgive me nodesu.<br/>
I've prepared myself for the meat to disappear at the dinner tonight, but Liza properly puts it like usual nodesu.<br/>
<br/>
Liza is gentle after all nodesu.<br/>
<br/>
When the next story needs a killing, I'll have Arisa as the victim nodesu. Arisa will surely forgive me while laughing nodesu. She will right desu?<br/>
