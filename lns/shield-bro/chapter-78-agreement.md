<br/>
Contract<br/>
Edited by EverydaySoCloudy<br/>
I recall the third day I was summoned.<br/>
During that time I was doubting everyone after the false accusation.<br/>
Moreover, I was getting tired of people trying to deceive me by pretending to be friendly.<br/>
……Eh?<br/>
Was there a chance that one of them actually wanted to be friends?<br/>
Everything back then that sounded good to me was just a lie for people to get close……<br/>
<br/>
Naofumi:"Do not concern yourselves with me!"<br/>
There were even some people who saluted and said they understood……<br/>
Eh?<br/>
Then, does that mean I drove away everyone from Silt Welt because I told them not to concern themselves with me!?<br/>
Because I kept rejecting people……?<br/>
Shiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiit!<br/>
I drop on my knees and hug my head.<br/>
Queen:" As expected, I was also troubled. Moreover, Iwatani-sama was causing problems and crimes in  various places."<br/>
Naofumi:"Urgg……"<br/>
The queen was thinking of me like that. The reproach in her voice was severe.<br/>
Queen:" Well there were situations solved that were thanks to you, so I’ll overlook it."<br/>
Naofumi:"……What do you mean?"<br/>
Queen:"You see, the heroes acted in order to remove the bad from this country."<br/>
If looking at the results they would all be successes.<br/>
Queen:" Iwatani-sama was crucial in solving the problems the other heroes caused."<br/>
The other heroes caused problems, and I was the fire-man going around the country putting out their flames.<br/>
Queen:" After the Three Heroes Church lost power, We are asking for co-operation with the Four Saints Faith to right the lies they spread about you."<br/>
The Three Heroes Church sure didn’t choose their methods.<br/>
Naofumi:"What about the other heroes?"<br/>
Queen:"As for the Spear, Bitch was with him, the sword, and bow seem to have been misled by false information from the guild."<br/>
Did they just trust whatever they heard first……?<br/>
Well, if the evidence they had to work with was little, it would make sense.<br/>
Though if it were me, I would just refuse the burden.<br/>
But since I don’t know, I cannot judge.<br/>
Naofumi:"Then next, Raphtalia…… did you have the slave trader show me her?"<br/>
Queen:"The more correct answer would be I gave instructions to a shadow. I do not know what kind of person this slave trader is."<br/>
That reminds me, that fellow didn’t talk to me like it was our first meeting.<br/>
Slave Trader:"There was a customer who wanted to enslave a hero. So I intended to approach Hero-sama with that open possibility, but I’ve changed my mind. Yup."<br/>
Those were the words that guy said on our first meeting.<br/>
Wanting a hero as a slave. It’s funny that such a person exists in this country.<br/>
Queen:" I heard the details. Please recall and think carefully. Do you think you can buy a slave with merely 20 pieces of silver?"<br/>
Naofumi:"Well……I don’t think so."<br/>
Considering the condition she was in, I wasn’t suspicious about the price, though I didn’t actually check the price of any other slaves.<br/>
It is doubtful that the wolf-man would have been sold to me for its actual price.<br/>
It seems compared to other shops it was remarkably cheap.<br/>
Seriously, that slave trader, what an outrageous fellow.<br/>
To help me and not talk about it.<br/>
Raphtalia:" Regardless of the circumstances in which I met Naofumi-sama, I am still grateful."<br/>
Raphtalia says so with a smile.<br/>
……That’s right. Even if there was something behind all of this, it doesn’t change the fact that I bought Raphtalia from the slave trader.<br/>
If Raphtalia wasn’t there protecting my back, then it would have been dangerous.<br/>
Raphtalia probably would have died if she had not met me either.<br/>
At that time, the slaves beside Raphtalia were put there to make sure I choose her.<br/>
In the end I used most of what little money I had accumulated. Buy a slave that should have been sold.<br/>
I would have likely doubted it if I was sold an excellent slave cheaply from the beginning.<br/>
However, betraying his expectations, Raphtalia grew up to be……First class goods.<br/>
Thinking back carefully, that slave trader really helped me.<br/>
Naofumi:"Alright then, moving on. What is the reason behind you not coming back to the country?"<br/>
Queen:"I think you understand from our talks. I was at the limits of my patience, and Melty wanted to meet Ault……Trash, so I laid a trap. The preparations for cornering the Three Heroes Church were also completed."<br/>
Thanks to her arrangements…… The fight swung in our favour.<br/>
Queen:"I did not think they would possess a replica of the Four Legendary Heroes weapon."<br/>
Even if I had been warned beforehand about the existence of such a weapon, the fight would still be incredibly difficult.<br/>
Queen:"The pope was a foolish man…… If he changed the replica weapon to a shield to receive Iwatani-sama’s attack, and perhaps his life would have been saved."<br/>
Naofumi:" It can become a shield too?"<br/>
Queen:"Of course. However, the replica only had one-fourth of the original legendary weapon’s power."<br/>
Naofumi:" That was only one-fourth?!"<br/>
Multiplying that power by four times……That’s just too ridiculous.<br/>
Well to be fair, if it wasn’t at least that strong it would not have been a legend in the first place.<br/>
Queen:"And my husband who had fought against our country’s nemesis Silt Welt in the old days, Trash has become a fool due to the long peace. If he was competent, or if his old wisdom returned, I would not be feeling this way now."<br/>
Yeah……I figured they did not want me to reach Silt Welt due to that kind of border security.<br/>
Is it possible that Trash wasn’t the one that sent all the knights to the border?<br/>
Oh well. We’re still in the middle of our conversion.<br/>
Queen:"Afterwards……Let’s see. I happened to be in range and helped out Iwatani-sama against the pope. After hearing all of this, do you still wish to go to Silt Welt and start a war?"<br/>
Naofumi:"Hrmm……"<br/>
Even if the queen thinks of me like that, is there any reason for me to protect them?<br/>
But……<br/>
Queen:"By the way, Silt Welt, or Schildfrieden, whichever one Iwatani would have went to, I will tell you the outcome of your choice."<br/>
Naofumi:"Hm?"<br/>
(TLnote: Shirudofuriden is changed to Schildfrieden which means Peace of the shield)<br/>
What does the queen intend to say?<br/>
Queen:"First, the Demi-human princesses, and nobles of various races will also approach Iwatani-sama, and thus a harem will be formed."<br/>
Naofumi:"That is disgusting!"<br/>
I feel nauseous thanks to the result of Bitch’s actions.<br/>
A bunch of women approaching me with ulterior motives.<br/>
Queen:" Anything you want would have been given to you. If you wanted to conquer this country the people would have gladly taken up arms and started a war."<br/>
Hmm……that does sound good. But a harem……<br/>
I’ll endure it……<br/>
Queen:"Though you will be fine till then. However, for all countries and all religions, those in power will be corrupted and have their beliefs dyed black."<br/>
Naofumi:"What?"<br/>
Queen:"Iwatani-sama would be risking…….unidentified illnesses and unfortunate accidents."<br/>
Naofumi:"……I don’t really understand."<br/>
Queen:" It was how the Hero of the shield in the past met his end."<br/>
I would rather not hear this.<br/>
Queen:"By the way,do you remember those adventurers who lied about wanting to be in your party?"<br/>
Naofumi:"……Yeah."<br/>
It was several days after I arrived in this world.<br/>
Queen:" Their horribly disfigured corpses were discovered several days later."<br/>
Naofumi:"Ge!?"<br/>
Queen:"There was also a soldier that asked for you signature a while ago."<br/>
Naofumi:"Yeah."<br/>
I gave it to him because he asked……No way.<br/>
Naofumi:"Did he die!?"<br/>
That fellow did his job properly. I would rather not see him meet his end like this.<br/>
Queen:"No……But, the clothes that Iwatani-sama signed was stolen. It seems he was stalked every day until it was gone."<br/>
Holy shit……That’s troublesome.<br/>
Queen:"Afterwords, the clothing was found to have been sold for a large amount sum in the black market."<br/>
Next time I meet him, I’ll apologize.<br/>
Queen:"I had to protect those soldiers who co-operated with Iwatani-sama."<br/>
Naofumi:"Ahh, are you blaming them?"<br/>
Queen:" The knight leader was attacked by someone and murdered. The culprit has not been caught yet. Perhaps……"<br/>
With that, I’ve concluded that Silt Welt is an extremist country.<br/>
What can I say?……Would going to Silt Welt be heaven or hell?<br/>
Of course, the queen’s story may not be entirely correct.<br/>
Queen:"I think that it would be safer for you to build your own relationships that you can trust."<br/>
Naofumi:"……"<br/>
However, there is no reason to co-operate.<br/>
The pain that I have received until now is not something that will simply just fade away with the queen using her power, I’m still not convinced.<br/>
Although I was concerned indirectly, the punishment and explanation the queen gave a little while ago was done as the one in power in this country.<br/>
Yet, she was too benevolent and showed mercy.<br/>
I admit that I do recognize her abilities, but I do not trust her.<br/>
Anything can be said.<br/>
Because it would be troublesome for them if I went to another country, I am being kept here.<br/>
If what she says is correct, then I would be highly received regardless of Schildfrieden or Silt Welt.<br/>
There is no special reason to staying in Melromarc.<br/>
Queen:"…………"<br/>
The queen is staring into my eyes while I think.<br/>
Queen:" Up until now, I have been covering for all the damage that Iwanati-sama has received until now. I understand this is a selfish. However, to me…….No, to this country, there is no other choice but to rely on you. If I can appease your anger with my head then I would gladly pay the price. If you wish I can even change my name. Therefore, please postpone your decision. I Mirelia Q Melromarc will take a magical contract, and vow that you will not be treated as you have been previously."<br/>
The queen bows deeply.<br/>
Melty is speechless at this scene, and Raphtalia can only watch with her eyes wide open.<br/>
Even Firo seems to have sensed something is happening from the atmosphere.<br/>
She……is only really thinking about what is best for the country.<br/>
If I really wanted Trash and Bitch dead, then there is no doubt that they would have died.<br/>
Is Melromarc really in such a dangerous position on the global scale?<br/>
In other words, the fate of this country has been entrusted to my hands.<br/>
If I wished I could destroy Melromarc.<br/>
But-<br/>
Naofumi:"Only once."<br/>
Queen:"What do you mean?"<br/>
Naofumi:" Your shadow has saved our lives before."<br/>
Queen:"That means……"<br/>
Naofumi:" I will believe you only once. Regardless of reason, there will be no next time."<br/>
Queen:"Thank you very much."<br/>
The queen lowered her head and bowed to me in appreciation.<br/>
This might sound good.<br/>
But I cannot go on doubting everything.<br/>
I…..No one is perfect.<br/>
The enemy of a Hero is not the country, it is the wave.<br/>
If Glass attacks while the countries are fighting each other, then we will be done for.<br/>
I will not forget that the three heroes were defeated by her in the previous wave.<br/>
There is no need to forcibly increase my enemies.<br/>
The situation of being attacked from the front and behind has changed.<br/>
If I defeat the wave, then I can return to my original world.<br/>
I will concentrate on fighting the wave…… and Glass from now on.<br/>
This is actually quite a big step forwards.<br/>
Naofumi:" Are we safe diplomatically?"<br/>
Queen:"I get what Iwatani-sama is asking, for the time being all the problems have been dealt with. The only problem is not having a dependable Hero-sama. Therefore I wish to ask for Iwatani-sama’s co-operation even if I have to take an oath."<br/>
Naofumi:"Are you going to punish the other heroes that you will be relying on?"<br/>
Queen:"Certainly. Due to the Hero-samas actions and assistance in subduing the Three Heroes Church their punishment won’t be too severe, but I still have to punish them due to criticism from the surrounding countries are increasing……"<br/>
Naofumi:"Is that so……that’s unfortunate."<br/>
Well, I was hoping to show those fellows hell. Either way, if a chance comes I’ll take it.<br/>
There are still a lot of things to discuss, but I suppose this is our position now.<br/>
Queen:" Could you keep our conversation a secret from those three? Heroes are human too. I don’t know what they will do if weakness is shown……"<br/>
Certainly, there were many things that probably can’t be said to those three heroes.<br/>
I don’t know about Motoyasu or Ren, but Itsuki might go into frenzy.<br/>
Above all, the situation around me will be improving greatly.<br/>
Naofumi:"Understood. One of those guys……"<br/>
Queen:"Yeah. Afterwards, I have the responsibility to watch over."<br/>
Naofumi:"Is that so, well after this one enemy has finally disappeared……"<br/>
Queen:"I am very sorry…… Please forgive me for summoning you without permission and forcing you to fight."<br/>
Naofumi:" It’s fine already. So what will you do from now on? Are you going to speak to those three?"<br/>
Queen:"Yes, we will talk about matters of your participation over dinner."<br/>
Naofumi:"Understood."<br/>
The queen gives instructions to a subordinate walks towards the throne.<br/>
Queen:"Melty……Let’s go."<br/>
Melty:" Ah……Okay."<br/>
Queen:" Iwatani-sama, thank you for protecting Melty."<br/>
The queen lowers her head and bows in gratitude.<br/>
Firo:" Is Mel-chan going somewhere?"<br/>
As expected, Firo seems to have understood and looks troubled.<br/>
Naofumi:" The world Melty lives in is different from us. It is unlikely we will be able to journey together like before."<br/>
It was difficult to say that while I turn to the queen.<br/>
Firo:"Really?"<br/>
Firo looks at Melty who is crying.<br/>
Melty:"……yeah."<br/>
Firo:"We can’t meet anymore?"<br/>
Melty:"……No. We will meet again. Many times. But travelling together is impossible."<br/>
Melty faces the queen.<br/>
The queen nods in confirmation.<br/>
Firo:"But….. I won’t say good-bye."<br/>
Melty:"Alright. However, Firo-chan is always welcome."<br/>
Melty tells Firo in a tearful voice.<br/>
It’s a fact that our journey had a big influence on Melty.<br/>
When the waves are over I made up my mind to leave Firo with Melty.<br/>
Firo:"Even if we separate, Mel-chan will always be Firo’s friend right!?"<br/>
Melty:" Yeah! No matter what I am Firo-chan’s friend."<br/>
<br/>
It was a touching scene, but goodbyes…… I’m not sure if you should be saying that now since we will still be in the castle today.<br/>
There is also no schedule for talking with the queen in the future.<br/>
But I’ll stay silent.<br/>
Because this will deepen their friendship.<br/>
Having a good friend is important, for both of them.<br/>
Raphtalia holds my hand as I watch the conversation.<br/>
I clench her hand silently and understood without turning around.<br/>
