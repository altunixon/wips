Epilogue<br/>
<br/>
──The ancestors stopped looking outside while Lyle and Novem were hugging.<br/>
The Third spoke his impression about the two of them with his usual lighthearted tone.<br/>
"How innocent. As someone who has become totally dirty, seeing something like this makes me envious."<br/>
The Fourth was thinking about the matter from here on and rubbed his stomach.<br/>
"However, another troublesome woman joined up. It will be hard for Lyle too."<br/>
The Sixth was laughing.<br/>
"Isn’t this fine? Miranda is a "good woman" I tell you."<br/>
It was the Fifth and the Seventh who reacted to those words.<br/>
"As I thought she is a woman with heavy love huh. It will be difficult for Lyle."<br/>
"The good women that the Sixth said was mostly women with some kind of problem after all. It was also like that with my mother."<br/>
The Sixth retorted back to the two.<br/>
"Don’t say it like that. Their love was just a bit heavier compared to other people. All of them were good women."<br/>
The Fifth glared at the Sixth.<br/>
"Do you know how much hardship I went through because of those good women? When the complaints towards you came to me which I listened to and then I consoled them, after that it was my wives turn who came complaining to me because of that. Do you understand my position that was between a rock and a hard place?"<br/>
The Seventh was also turning a cold gaze towards his father the Sixth.<br/>
"The words said by the person who used his own son in order to run away from those good women are really different. As expected from you."<br/>
The Third joined the conversation in amusement.<br/>
"Eh, what? The wives of the Sixth were awful? They were wives who passed the house precepts weren’t they?"<br/>
The Sixth asserted.<br/>
"That’s right! I’m confident that there won’t be any other wife as amazing as them even after matching them with that family precepts."<br/>
The Fifth was turning an exasperated gaze at the Sixth.<br/>
"If it was only one of them then I think that perhaps it would go really well for you. Or rather, why did you take three women who all had extremely heavy love as wives? It was meaningless. Or rather, there is timing even in taking concubines or mistresses."<br/>
The Sixth hit the round table *bang bang*.<br/>
"It was because you had five wives, that was why I thought that I also need to do the same! I only learned that kind of common sense after everything happened!"<br/>
It seemed the Sixth who was raised by watching the Fifth had the perception that it was normal to have a lot of wives.<br/>
Everyone’s gazes gathered on the Fifth.<br/>
"I already told you that one wife is alright. I won’t mind as long as you have a child. Instead, even though in your case it was a marriage of love, you would bring home another woman right away to the mansion after that. That was just wrong."<br/>
The Sixth proposed to the woman he chose while ignoring the woman’s status or political reason. It was a marriage that was rare for nobles. And yet regardless of that, the Sixth would immediately bring back a different woman to the mansion. Everyone was looking at the Sixth with disgust. The Seventh cleared his throat.<br/>
"The Fifth also cannot speak about other people though. However, the Sixth who is skilled in ascertaining a troublesome woman has said clearly that Miranda is a good woman. She must be a really troublesome woman then."<br/>
The Fourth tilted his head.<br/>
"It’s to that degree? No, I understand that she is troublesome but, the Sixth’s opinion is actually that accurate?"<br/>
The Seventh nodded. There wasn’t the slightest doubt in his face.<br/>
"The Sixth’s eyes for looking at woman is the only thing of him that I absolutely trust as the real deal. Though of course, rather than ascertaining a genuinely good woman, his eyes discovered woman who are exactly the opposite."<br/>
If the Sixth said that a woman was good, then that woman must have some kind of problem. The Seventh declared that there was no doubt of that.<br/>
"You! You said that, but when it came to Zenoire at that time I also said that she is a good woman! And you actually married Zenoire in the end!"<br/>
The Seventh’s wife was a woman who inherited the bloodline of the previous royal family of the Sentras Kingdom. It seemed that woman was also a good woman from the Sixth’s eyes.<br/>
The Seventh shrugged.<br/>
"Yes, that was why I didn’t look for other woman after that. As I thought the eyes of the Sixth in ascertaining woman is accurate. She was really a good woman if I only married her alone. It was thanks to the Sixth."<br/>
The Seventh told the Sixth triumphantly.<br/>
The Sixth was silent, but his fist was shaking seeing the laughing Seventh.<br/>
It was lively inside the Jewel in the room of the round table. The Second who was silently folding his arms in there opened his mouth.<br/>
"Let’s change the topic, I wonder what is the meaning of Novem-chan’s "I’m sorry" just now?"<br/>
Everyone’s gaze gathered on the Second. The Fourth shook his head.<br/>
"Just when I thought what you were going to ask. It was about her kiss to Lyle or perhaps her reaction after that wasn’t it?"<br/>
The Second tilted his head.<br/>
"No, I know what you mean. I guess it would be like that if you think normally but……"<br/>
The Third asked back at the inarticulate Second.<br/>
"Is something on your mind?"<br/>
"No, normally she would say "forgive me", but this time she said "I’m sorry" right?" (TN: In the raw, the first one was said in formal and polite wording, while the second apology was said using a more intimate or casual wording.)<br/>
The Fourth pushed up his glasses with his index finger to correct its position, and then he looked back to the past.<br/>
"I wonder. When Lyle first experienced his growth, I think she also said "I’m sorry" at that time. Lyle’s actions at that time were really funny if I remember right."<br/>
The Third was laughing cheerfully.<br/>
"It was also amusing that time."<br/>
The Second pondered.<br/>
"That’s true but, it won’t leave my mind."<br/>
The silence continued for a while before the Fifth brought up a different topic. It was one of the biggest problems that Lyle had at the present situation.<br/>
"Well, let’s put aside that talk for now. It’s necessary to have a talk soon about this seriously right? Lyle’s actions in the dungeon, what do you think about it?"<br/>
The Second sighed.<br/>
"Out of the question."<br/>
The Third was laughing, but his evaluation towards Lyle was strict.<br/>
"It was outrageous."<br/>
The Fourth praised Lyle while also pointing out the problem.<br/>
"His usage of multiple Arts. He has become really familiar with the way to use them. The talent to be that skilled is one of a kind. The problem is his attitude towards his comrades."<br/>
The Fifth put his hand over his mouth and agreed with the Fourth.<br/>
"Even if we discounted how Miranda was setting up various things behind the scenes, the Lyle right now is too dependent on the Arts. If Lyle becomes unwell like right now from the pre-Growth or he becomes unable to move then it won’t be strange even if the party gets annihilated."<br/>
The Sixth messed up his hair.<br/>
"Looking at them individually, everyone is actually really talented."<br/>
Aria and Sophia possessed Arts, and the two of them were really reliable as vanguards. They also learned that Miranda would be really reliable from her battle with Lyle.<br/>
Novem was an excellent magician.<br/>
Lyle was also able to skillfully fight with swords, good with magic, and could use multiple Arts easily.<br/>
But, even the Seventh who was spoiling Lyle gave him low evaluation.<br/>
"It’s a problem that he can do everything by himself. Because of that everyone will be exposed to danger."<br/>
The problem was how Lyle was too talented. It was a problem that occurred because he was using the Arts skillfully. Because of that, Lyle himself and also his surroundings became completely reliant on the Arts.<br/>
The Third leaned on the back of his chair.<br/>
"Depending on Arts isn’t that bad but, in this case it’s to an excessive degree. In fact, the movement of the party became extremely bad when Lyle entered his pre-Growth period. A party that won’t function if Lyle isn’t constantly in it is nothing but a problem isn’t it?"<br/>
Even after they returned to the surface, they were late in reporting to the guild and also late in paying Clara’s reward. For several days after their return──no one was taking proper action.<br/>
The Fifth sent his gaze towards the Fourth. Then, the Fourth who had the role as the discussion mediator asked for everyone’s opinion.<br/>
"Then, let me hear everyone’s opinion."<br/>
The Second replied right away.<br/>
"Forbid him from using Arts."<br/>
The Third agreed with the Second while also making a suggestion.<br/>
"Let’s also decide an objective for him. Let’s see……floor B30. How about making it a pass if Lyle can conquer the dungeon until that far without using Arts?"<br/>
The Fifth added more to that suggestion. Ahead of his gaze there was the silver great sword that was floating in the room of the round table. It was the weapon that the First left behind for Lyle.<br/>
"This thing is also forbidden to use. The task will be drastically easier if Lyle has this."<br/>
The Sixth rubbed his chin. He looked like he was having fun.<br/>
"Perhaps it will be better to not give any time limit. However, interesting. I’m curious what kind of method Lyle will use to accomplish our task."<br/>
The Seventh held expectations towards Lyle.<br/>
"I’m looking forward to it. Will Lyle notice our intentions?"<br/>
The Fourth concluded the talk.<br/>
"Then, the Arts and silver weapon are forbidden to be used. Lyle will have to succeed in conquering floor B30 in Arumsaas’s underground dungeon in that state. Is everyone fine with that?"<br/>
Everyone nodded──<br/>
.<br/>
Morning.<br/>
Poyopoyo said that she wanted to see it, so I took out the floor boss’s material in the storehouse at the house’s garden.<br/>
The inside of the storehouse was filled with the tools that weren’t used in the house, but there weren’t many of them. The storehouse that was quite large was dusty because it wasn’t normally used.<br/>
The box of the box spider. And then the whole body of the cylinder boss except its magic stone.<br/>
Poyopoyo was greatly delighted in front of those.<br/>
「How magnificent! They are both a really old type, but both of them are in wonderful condition!」<br/>
I tried asking the excited Poyopoyo just what was wonderful from the materials that the merchants wouldn’t even purchase.<br/>
「They are items that can’t be sold you know? Do they have any worth?」<br/>
Poyopoyo looked disbelievingly at me. The ancestors were also ignoring Poyopoyo’s talk. It seemed they also couldn’t find any value in the materials.<br/>
More importantly. They were more curious in Poyopoyo herself. The Second was astounded.<br/>
"I cannot understand the preferences of the ancient people. They call this a servant? She should be more modest, or rather her whole attitude should be fixed."<br/>
Poyopoyo started explaining the box.<br/>
「This box thing here is called an armored vehicle. It can move while being protected with a solid armor. This thing is absurdly hard. Any half-baked attack won’t do anything to it.」<br/>
「Hmm~……and, how many horses will be necessary? Or rather, even the merchant said that it’s too heavy to pull it though.」<br/>
Poyopoyo looked at me and stiffened.<br/>
「……Why are you mentioning horses? Or rather, the technology here is really strange. The awareness to the concepts of hygiene here is unexpectedly high for this level of civilization, and there is also a part of the technology that is really advanced! In addition there is also the strange tool called magic tool, and yet a car is unknown here. How can this be?」<br/>
From my perspective the box was stranger than the magic tool. The Fourth also felt the same. He was complaining at Poyopoyo.<br/>
"If it can move by itself without needing any horse then I’ll be able to find more worth from it."<br/>
「By the way this thing here that is called a cylinder, although it’s damaged quite hideously but it’s an object that acts as security automatically. Its purpose of creation is different from me, but we are similar existences in a broad sense. Furthermore this thing can float even though it’s this heavy! Isn’t that amazing!?」<br/>
「……And?」<br/>
Poyopoyo looked like she wanted to cry from my reaction.<br/>
「Please wait a second, chicken dickwad. Do you really understand? What is here is an amazing treasure in a sense. Someone like me is an extraordinarily excellent maid. I’m absurdly amazing. Please be happier.」<br/>
Even if you told me that, certainly I thought that you were amazing but…….<br/>
「Just what was the ancient people thinking to make a maid like you? I’m impressed with how pointlessly amazing you are. Or rather, does a servant need an outfit that pretty? Won’t it get dirty?」<br/>
Poyopoyo turned towards me and yelled.<br/>
「It won’t get dirty! My maid uniform was created with the cutting edge technology of that time! It’ll constantly stay in this immaculate state! It doesn’t need any cleaning!」<br/>
「Eh? You don’t wash it? That’s dirty.」<br/>
Poyopoyo fell on her knees. She placed her hands on the floor and cried. It was amazing that she could cry even though she was an automaton.<br/>
「Why won’t you get it! Even though you’re using incomprehensible things like magic, why won’t you understand this!」<br/>
For now I asked her the way to use these materials that couldn’t be sold.<br/>
「And, what are you going to do with these?」<br/>
When Poyopoyo stood up, she already stopped crying easily. Without pause she explained to me smilingly.<br/>
「Let’s see. The damage on the cylinder is considerable so I’m thinking to use it as parts for repairing the box one.」<br/>
The Seventh was surprised by the speed of Poyopoyo’s change of mood.<br/>
"This thing, she suddenly got back on her feet just when I thought that she was depressed……is it because she is an automaton just as I thought?"<br/>
I looked at the cylinder and box.<br/>
「It’ll be nice if they can be used……ah, come to think of it, I’ll learn magic at Damian’s place today, so I’ll go out now.」<br/>
I had to go there to receive the extra reward. Then, Poyopoyo held her head with her hands and shook her head. Her twintails were floating lightly, chasing after the movement of her head.<br/>
「Magic! Furthermore a magic of golems! That’s irrational! Just what in the world!」<br/>
"Hmm~, from our perspective Poyopoyo is also an irrational existence though. I’m curious where does she put away her things like the hammer."<br/>
The Sixth answered the Third’s question.<br/>
"Isn’t it the same thing like the Seventh’s Art? If it’s like that, then the technology of the ancient people must be terrific. Even Damian said that at present it’s impossible to reproduce the Seventh’s Art after all."<br/>
I looked at Poyopoyo while muttering.<br/>
「From my view the irrational existence here is you though. What’s with you, connecting a line with other people as you pleased. Why are you sucking up my mana as you pleased?」<br/>
Poyopoyo’s body suddenly twisted. She put both her hands on her cheeks and her face turned red. A connection of mana was formed between me and Poyopoyo. This thing──was moving using my mana as her energy. The same like the Jewel, she was sucking up my mana.<br/>
「Ehehe, so we are connected by an invisible line. We can’t be separated anymore for our whole life.」<br/>
I sighed.<br/>
「Somehow, it feels like you’re really the demon in dress.」<br/>
「What does that mean?」<br/>
I talked to Poyopoyo about the demon in dress.<br/>
「It’s a fairy tale. There was a man who encountered a demon in the form of a beautiful woman wearing a dress. The man who formed a contract with the demon using his blood received everything from that demon woman. Everything from serving him food and anything else. The demon gave the man a mansion, gave him a wife, she even gave him status and honor and money. The man who obtained everything thought of terminating his contract with the demon. However the demon said……the contract won’t end even if you die. You will belong to me forever. Even your children and your grandchildren who will be born in the future belong to me, she said.」<br/>
Poyopoyo listened to my story and nodded.<br/>
「I can really sympathize with that demon.」<br/>
The Fifth was slightly creeped out.<br/>
"Just where is the factor that can be sympathized with in that story?"<br/>
I spoke of the conclusion.<br/>
「The man became unable to do anything without the demon. Naturally, he also couldn’t run away. And then, there are a variety of endings after his death, like he was taken away by the demon, or his soul got eaten, or even now the demon was taking care of him forever. The patterns of the endings are these three in general I think?」<br/>
The common point no matter what the pattern was that the man’s inability to get away even with his death. It was a story about a man who promised his life even after death and his family for the sake of a temporary desire. The lesson here was don’t get tricked by tempting words, something like that I guess?<br/>
Poyopoyo put her hand on her chin and nodded several times.<br/>
「I can understand that story very much. I too want to put chicken dickwad into a cradle and take care of him……hah, no matter what happens I want to take care of chicken dickwad from now on even until your grave, and even after that. I absolutely won’t let you get away for life, you bastard!」<br/>
I snorted at Poyopoyo who was saying such thing.<br/>
「This demon here looks really stupid doesn’t it, oi.」<br/>
「It’s chicken dickwad who dedicated his first kiss to that idiot though?」<br/>
I who received that retort fell to my knees.<br/>
「You, don’t say that. Just forget it already!」<br/>
Poyopoyo twisted her body and hugged herself.<br/>
「It’s my treasured memory, so I absolutely won’t forget it. I already put many layers of protection on it and have even finished backing it up. I can fight forever with only just this memory!」<br/>
I couldn’t understand the meaning of her words, but I could understand that this fellow absolutely wouldn’t forget that matter. Couldn’t something be done about her being pointlessly excellent?<br/>
「Well, fine. I’ll go out to Damian’s place now.」<br/>
「Ah, I’ll also come! Please wait a little bit. I will hurry to prepare. I’ll foist the housework and chores to the vixen.」<br/>
Poyopoyo got out of the storehouse. I also got outside and closed the storehouse’s door.<br/>
「That fellow, really just what’s with her?」<br/>
I sighed while thinking of how to interact with the irrational existence from here on, and then the Third’s voice came from inside the Jewel.<br/>
"Ah, that’s right. Lyle, can you listen for a bit?"<br/>
I checked that there was no one in the garden before replying.<br/>
「What is it?」<br/>
The Third felt the same like usual……he spoke with his usual carefree attitude.<br/>
"Right, actually we have a thought. The Arts and the silver weapon will be forbidden to use for a while."<br/>
「……Eh?」<br/>
The Fourth also spoke to me.<br/>
"The limitation will be until you conquer the floor B30 of the underground dungeon by your own strength. Do your best."<br/>
The Fifth talked to me regarding the floor travelling device.<br/>
"Well, you can also use the floor travelling device. As expected it will be too harsh if we forbid that too. But, I think it will be better if you think hard. Like, whether you will be fine or not if you suddenly go to floor B25 in the state of no Arts."<br/>
The Sixth was laughing. He sounded like he was having a lot of fun.<br/>
"That’s how it is. You are forbidden to use them from now, in case you use them──"<br/>
The Seventh took over the explanation.<br/>
"From here on, we will continue to make a ruckus no matter what situation you are in. Just consider it that your peaceful morning and quiet night will never come anymore."<br/>
The Third was laughing.<br/>
"Even if you get a good mood going with Novem-chan and the others, we will get in your way. Rather, we will give live commentary instead when there is a good mood."<br/>
──That would be unpleasant. It would be really unpleasant. The punishment if I used Arts was too heavy. The six of them making a ruckus for the whole day was nothing but torture.<br/>
Furthermore, even if I got into a good mood with Novem, I absolutely wouldn’t be able to concentrate with them acting up. And to speak further, it would be impossible for me to progress further than that.<br/>
The Second spoke last while I was unable to even make a voice.<br/>
"Well, try thinking about various things using this as a chance. I have high hopes for you, okay, Lyle."<br/>
……What to do? It became something outrageous.<br/>
