15-39. Divine Punishment (8), Dog Hero Pochi<br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
※This time it's not from Satou's perspective<br/>
<br/>
"Choiyaa, nanodesu!"<br/>
<br/>
Blue and purple sparks dyed the battlefield.<br/>
Breaking through the reverberation of the distorted space, numerous holy swords assail the demon lord's sword arms.<br/>
<br/>
Golden Knight Yellow and her split bodies unleashed a single blow on the sword demon lord, landing behind it.<br/>
<br/>
『whyＤＷＥＥＤgozaru』<br/>
<br/>
The sword demon lord sets up the reverberation traps using Space Magic that Pochi and her split bodies ignored like a trick in front of them once again. <br/>
<br/>
Her split bodies might have decreased, but there's still 47 of them remaining.<br/>
<br/>
"This much is nothing nanodesu!"<br/>
<br/>
Pochi and her split bodies accurately see through the space traps and annihilate them with their holy swords.<br/>
<br/>
『hoWＷＥＥＤgozaru』<br/>
"It's father bought the sacrifice of 72 pudding-sans nodesuyo."<br/>
<br/>
Pochi probably mistook [Chichikawareta (father bought)] for [Tsuchikawareta (As a result of)].<br/>
If this were a web novel, there's no doubt that comments correcting the typo would pour in like rain.<br/>
<br/>
The desperate struggle against the purple haired girl, Arisa and her [Game of Tag] flashed in Pochi's mind.<br/>
Every time she lost a fight, her snacks and puddings were mercilessly taken.<br/>
<br/>
"direct match ＤＷＥＥＤgozaru."<br/>
<br/>
The sword demon lord's arms increased to six, each arms held a different weapon.<br/>
<br/>
"Yes, nanodesu."<br/>
<br/>
Together with the 47 split bodies, she shifts to close combat against the sword demon lord.<br/>
It's a high speed battle that no ordinary human can see.<br/>
<br/>
The split bodies disappear one after another, but each of them damaged the sword demon lord.<br/>
<br/>
"Uwaa, I can't move well."<br/>
<br/>
Hero Meiko also wanted to participate in the battle, but she couldn't get used to her tripled stats and fell to the ground many times.<br/>
<br/>
"Ugege, watch out you."<br/>
<br/>
Hero Meiko futilely shouted while evading the raining Magic Edge Cannons and the sword demon lord's flame bullets with her Unique Skill, [Unrivaled Mobility]. <br/>
<br/>
<br/>
◇<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
"Uwawa, nanodesu."<br/>
"emperor ＤＷＥＥＤgozaru."<br/>
<br/>
The Great Demon Lord who had lost its lower body was blown to between the two who were fighting fiercely.<br/>
<br/>
"The big meat-san came nodesu."<br/>
<br/>
Pochi who had lost a lot of calorie from the high speed battle licked her lip under the helmet.<br/>
<br/>
The blown salt disappeared, the intellectual eyes of the Great Weasel Demon Lord look at Pochi from below.<br/>
<br/>
"Golden armor...."<br/>
"Meat-san talked nodesu!"<br/>
<br/>
Pochi was surprised.<br/>
<br/>
"Are you an attendant of Hero Nanashi?"<br/>
"Yes nanodesu! Pochi is Master's sword, Golden Knight Yellow nanodesu!"<br/>
"Is that right."<br/>
<br/>
The Great Weasel Demon Lord partly closed his eyes after hearing Pochi's answer.<br/>
<br/>
"WOOOOOOOOOOOOOO!"<br/>
<br/>
Hero Meiko wrapped in blue light is about to cut the Great Weasel Demon Lord.<br/>
<br/>
A clear sound echoed in the battlefield, purple and blue light shined on the Great Demon Lord's body.<br/>
The sword demon lord intercepted her holy sword.<br/>
<br/>
"Tsk, you glittering little thing over there! Hold back the sword demon lord properly!"<br/>
"Pochi is troubled if you tell her that nodesu. Please wait a bit nodesuyo."<br/>
<br/>
The troubled Pochi's ears flopped down under the helmet at Hero Meiko's unreasonable demand.<br/>
<br/>
"Mou, you're useless!"<br/>
"eliminateＤＷＥＥＤgozaru."<br/>
<br/>
Receiving fierce attacks from the sword demon lord, Hero Meiko separates away from Pochi.<br/>
<br/>
"Is weasel-san a demon lord person nodesu?"<br/>
"Umu, I'm the Great Weasel Demon Lord."<br/>
"Are you a bad demon lord nanodesu? Master told Pochi not to fight good demon lords nodesu."<br/>
"Like I said! Bad demon lord's friends are all bad people!"<br/>
<br/>
Hero Meiko who had come nearby interfered Pochi's question.<br/>
<br/>
"It's as that girl has said, demon lords are evil from Gods and Heroes's perspective."<br/>
<br/>
The Great Weasel Demon Lord addressed Pochi's question with a quiet voice.<br/>
<br/>
"However, good and evil depend on your viewpoint. From the perspective of people who rebel against the Gods that restrain people's growth and happiness, we are the light of hope."<br/>
"Hahn! No matter how many sophism you spin, you're the bad one here for breaking the rule of this world!"<br/>
<br/>
Hero Meiko shouted while fighting the sword demon lord.<br/>
It's as if this is an anime or manga, but her ears probably also got improved from the tripled stats.<br/>
<br/>
"killＤＷＥＥＤgozaru."<br/>
"YOUUUUU!"<br/>
<br/>
The sword demon lord caught up with her, and they parted away from the two again.<br/>
<br/>
"Pochi doesn't really understand if it's too difficult nodesu."<br/>
"I see--."<br/>
<br/>
The Great Weasel Demon Lord closed his eyes while regenerating his lower body.<br/>
<br/>
"Then let me say this. I bear no hostility towards Hero Nanashi. Although we cannot be called friends, we're like acquaintances."<br/>
"You know Master nodesu?　Then Pochi won't fight nodesu."<br/>
"Is that right, that is most excellent--it's about time."<br/>
<br/>
The Great Weasel Demon Lord turns his head.<br/>
His eyes were looking at the last demon lord that was blown away to the horizon as the yellow giant arrived at the center of the palace.<br/>
<br/>
The yellow giant that arrived at the ruined palace repeatedly hit the ground with both its arms.<br/>
<br/>
"It's like a child throwing a tantrum."<br/>
<br/>
The Great Weasel Demon Lord that has finished regenerating his lower body stands up.<br/>
<br/>
"What's the yellow person doing nodesu?"<br/>
"There is something that guy seeks below that place."<br/>
"A big meat nanodesu?"<br/>
<br/>
The Great Weasel Demon Lord pleasantly laughed at Pochi's words full of her appetite.<br/>
<br/>
"That guy wants only one thing. Depriving the 『Dragon's Vein Connection』 that Troll Demon Lord has."<br/>
"Dragon's Vein, nanodesu?"<br/>
<br/>
Pochi tilts her head, she's heard the words somewhere before.<br/>
<br/>
....Unfortunately, it seems she can't recall it.<br/>
<br/>
"It's an authority that the Dragon God had only ever given to one god; the Demon God once."<br/>
"That's amazing nodesu."<br/>
<br/>
The Great Demon Lord talked while putting up a mysterious air, but Pochi responded randomly with a low tension voice.<br/>
<br/>
Getting whatever response after especially talking about the secret like that, the Great Demon Lord tasted the feeling of letdown.<br/>
If his subordinates were to saw his slightly pitiful face, they would likely think that it was rare.<br/>
<br/>
A flash-like small light wraps the yellow giant.<br/>
<br/>
"It's coming--if you have a way to defend yourself, use it. If you don't, hide behind my body."<br/>
"Why nanodesu?"<br/>
<br/>
The Great Weasel Demon Lord moves to cover Pochi behind his back.<br/>
Apparently, he's taken a liking to the pure Pochi.<br/>
<br/>
"Explosions that will shake the earth are coming."<br/>
"That's terrible nanodesu!"<br/>
<br/>
It's as if Pochi's surprise was the switch as several flashes ran through center of the yellow giant--God Zaikuon, thunderous roars erased the surrounding sounds.<br/>
Most of the forces and the explosions were directed right above the yellow giant, but they were strong enough to blow away every salt buildings around.<br/>
<br/>
"--GWUOOOO"<br/>
<br/>
White pebbles broke through the purple light defending the Great Weasel Demon Lord, Pochi who was being covered behind him jumped to his side.<br/>
<br/>
"Weasel person is in danger nodesu!　『Phalanxusu~』」<br/>
<br/>
Pochi climbed on the giant body of the Great Weasel Demon Lord, and then she stretched her short arms and spread open the disposable defensive shield, Phalanx.<br/>
Even only for a short time, this can actualize the same defensive power as the later model of Castle that Golden Knight White Nana has.<br/>
<br/>
"Auch, nanodesu."<br/>
<br/>
However, the white pebbles broke through that impregnable defense.<br/>
It's the same white splinters that pierced through the Great Weasel Demon Lord.<br/>
<br/>
Pochi who slipped off the Great Weasel Demon Lord, flicked away a white splinter that pierced through the demon lord with holy sword Durandal.<br/>
<br/>
"Awawa, the holy sword broke nodesu."<br/>
"Conceal yourself behind my body obediently, there's only a few of them but those are the splinters of Dragon Fangs--the ultimate weapon that pierces even God."<br/>
<br/>
While saying that, the Great Weasel Demon Lord increased the thickness of his purple aura.<br/>
<br/>
Intermittent sounds of explosions are still continuing even now, the white Imperial Capital seen from behind the Great Weasel Demon Lord is hidden by horrible salt and soil smoke.<br/>
<br/>
"Alright then nanodesu!"<br/>
<br/>
Pochi hit on a good idea hearing the Great Weasel Demon Lord, she dropped the holy sword and put her hand inside the Golden Armor's storing pocket.<br/>
A white splinter that pierced through the Great Weasel Demon Lord's body was flicked away by the white sword that Pochi took out.<br/>
<br/>
"This time Pochi will protect you nodesu!"<br/>
<br/>
The Phalanx that has lost its effect disappears in front of Pochi who goes around in front of the Great Weasel Demon Lord.<br/>
<br/>
With a speed that can't be seen with naked eyes, Pochi intercepts the white buckshots that are coming flying faster than the speed of sound.<br/>
<br/>
"Don't tell me that's a Dragon Fang Sword--"<br/>
<br/>
The Great Weasel Demon Lord muttered.<br/>
<br/>
It's as he's guessed, the sword Pochi uses, Dragon Fang Sword--is a sword made from a lesser dragon fang created by the Ancient Dragon using Primeval Magic.<br/>
It can be said to be the completed form of the swords used by the Empire's Temple Knights.<br/>
<br/>
"Uoryaa, nanodesu."<br/>
<br/>
With spirited yells, Pochi intercepted all the shots.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
◇<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
"It didn't die even after getting hit by that directly huh...."<br/>
<br/>
The Great Weasel Demon Lord is looking at the yellow giant bending down on the ground of the imperial palace's remain.<br/>
Even though the yellow light has weakened like it's going to disappear, it continues to pulse as if asserting its life force.<br/>
<br/>
"We'd probably win if we had several more shots of that, but I cannot ask for too much."<br/>
<br/>
The Great Weasel Demon Lord stands up while bleeding out.<br/>
<br/>
"You shouldn't move nanodesu! You're hurt all over nodesuyo!"<br/>
<br/>
Seeing the gushing blood, Pochi rummages through the Golden Armor's pocket in panic. <br/>
She finally found the health recovery magic potion and generously use it on the Great Weasel Demon Lord's wounds.<br/>
<br/>
The magic potion showed its effect before long, the bleeding stopped.<br/>
<br/>
"Thank you. Little hero."<br/>
"Yes nanodesu. But, Pochi is not a hero, she's Golden Knight Yellow nodesuyo?"<br/>
"Is that so, pure one. I will carve that name on my soul, Golden Knight Yellow, Pochi."<br/>
<br/>
Pochi panicked when she heard that.<br/>
<br/>
"Pochi's name is a secret nanodesu! Being known is bad nanodesuyo."<br/>
<br/>
The Great Weasel Demon Lord laughs happily.<br/>
<br/>
"Then I will keep that name a secret. I vow to never speak of it to anyone."<br/>
"Thank you nanodesu."<br/>
<br/>
『ＤＡＡＡＡＺＥgozaru.』<br/>
<br/>
The sword demon lord who's bleeding all over landed beside the Great Weasel Demon Lord.<br/>
Only one of its six arms remains.<br/>
<br/>
"There's blood all over nanodesu.... But, there's no more magic potion nodesu."<br/>
<br/>
Pochi shoved her hand in the Golden Armor Pocket and got flustered.<br/>
Her figure looks like a certain panic-prone cat robot.<br/>
<br/>
"Don't worry, the bleeding has already stopped."<br/>
<br/>
The Great Weasel Demon Lord puts his giant paw on top of Pochi who's on the verge of tears.<br/>
<br/>
"Besides, I only need to give the decisive blow on that guy next."<br/>
<br/>
The gentle eyes of the Great Weasel Demon Lord sharply changed the moment they turned at the yellow giant, like he was a different person.<br/>
<br/>
"Wa it!　De mon, lord...."<br/>
<br/>
Pushing through the salt ground, Hero Meiko who looked like a ghost stood up.<br/>
Apparently, she also survived the attack earlier by continuously using her Unique Skill, [Unrivaled Mobility].<br/>
<br/>
However, that required a great compensation--.<br/>
<br/>
"The hero girl is in tatter nanodesu!"<br/>
<br/>
--Blue lines emerge on Hero Meiko's body, blue lights are leaking from her mouth and eyes, just like how she was before drinking Pochi's potion.<br/>
<br/>
"de, mon lord..... DEMONLOOOOOOOOORD"<br/>
<br/>
Hero Meiko screamed and then blue light are emitting furiously from the lines and holes on her body.<br/>
<br/>
"Fallen hero huh--how pitiful."<br/>
<br/>
The Great Weasel Demon Lord quietly muttered.<br/>
<br/>
"Awawa, something's bad with hero girl nanodesu."<br/>
<br/>
Pochi doesn't know what to do, and the fact that she can't ask help from her master Satou and her comrades makes her restless.<br/>
Even though she knows how to fight, she's still a little child who lacks experience, so it's understandable.<br/>
<br/>
"Parion's heroes won't become demon lords even if their Soul Vessel is broken."<br/>
<br/>
The Great Weasel Demon Lord gave a signal to the sword demon lord to lead Hero Meiko to the other side of the battlefield.<br/>
<br/>
"The vessel of a fallen hero is completely broken, they change into a hunting machine that will continue to hunt demon lords until they breathe their last. Any kind of healing magic no longer works on them."<br/>
<br/>
The Great Weasel Demon Lord is looking at Hero Meiko who's destroying the sword demon lord without being afraid of getting injured.<br/>
Pochi looks at the rampaging Hero Meiko while crying and shouting.<br/>
<br/>
"Pochi, Pochi couldn't do anything at all nodesu."<br/>
<br/>
She's exhausted all her medicines, and she can't communicate with her master and comrades.<br/>
Pochi was at a loss.<br/>
<br/>
That cannot be helped.<br/>
In a world where it's common to lose your life to the unreasonable violences, her master prioritized to make her learn the way to survive.<br/>
<br/>
Even though that sacrificed everything else, the fact that she's able to survive in a battlefield where demon lords and God are rampaging in just less than two years is a proof of the success of that objective.<br/>
<br/>
If we're talking game-like, I guess it's the result of putting all growth points toward combat-oriented abilities?<br/>
<br/>
"If you can't do anything, then do not ever forget that chagrin."<br/>
<br/>
The Great Weasel Demon Lord who's overlooking Pochi gives an advice.<br/>
<br/>
"And learn."<br/>
<br/>
With tears in the corners of her eyes, Pochi looks up at the Great Weasel Demon Lord.<br/>
<br/>
"In order to catch up with your ideal self someday...."<br/>
"Yes nanodesu."<br/>
<br/>
One feeling buds inside Pochi who's clenching her fists.<br/>
Whether that withers or grows into a great tree depends on her own will and supports from her surroundings.<br/>
<br/>
Pochi is looking up at the Great Weasel Demon Lord with eyes full of determination.<br/>
<br/>
And then--.<br/>
<br/>
As if waiting for that, the space beside Pochi broke like it was made of glass.<br/>
<br/>
And the one who emerged from there was--.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
