A few words before we begin.<br/>
I’ll be taking over this project from yAmi so s/he can dedicate his time for his/her other main project. I must say this story interests me enough to the point I actually want people to read it. And so here we are.<br/>
This will not be the only project in this site. I will eventually pick up other projects (and you get to suggest me new projects to pick up). But I will do it only after we catch up with the latest chapter of the Ouroboros WN. I do commissioned LN translations from time to time and if the commissioner give me the green light I’ll put them here as well.<br/>
Regretfully, due to my job (I work part-time as a translator in a certain firm and do some freelance jobs as well), I must say that I can’t update this WN regularly, though I will at the very least try to deliver one chapter a week. On the flip side though, if you’re in luck I may, from time to time, give you back-to-back chapters in a very short interval.<br/>
