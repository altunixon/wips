Epilogue<br/>
<br/>
The preparation to move out from the house of thr Circry sisters was finished. The house had become really clean.<br/>
It seemed that the house was purchased in order for Miranda-san and Shannon to live in, but Miranda-san said that it was unneeded if they departed on a journey and sold it.<br/>
It seemed that from the beginning it was a property that was given to them, so they could do as they liked with it.<br/>
「Miranda-san, you have really made up your mind huh.」<br/>
When I said that, Miranda-san turned a smile towards me.<br/>
「It’s unnecessary if I’m coming with Lyle. Well, take care of me from here on too.」<br/>
I honestly felt happy to have affection directed towards me but it was embarrassing. Even so…….<br/>
「Miranda, is it okay to put the luggage here?」<br/>
「Miranda-san, what should I do with this?」<br/>
Aria-san and Sophia-san came bringing the luggage of Miranda-san and the others.<br/>
The friction until now was like a lie.<br/>
I asked the two of them what happened, but it seemed Miranda-san was intentionally provoking them to motivate them.<br/>
Now that the misunderstanding had been resolved, they got along well like before.<br/>
「Wait a second. Lyle, I’ll go to do my preparation.」<br/>
I saw off Miranda-san walking towards the two of them, then my gaze turned towards Porter.<br/>
Monika said that she would remodel it since the morning and slipped below Porter doing something.<br/>
「If I install this part, Porter’s spec will jump up by three times! Well, I’m lying though. But, thirty percent! No, it should improve by twenty percent?」<br/>
She muttered by herself noisily.<br/>
Clara-san was also helping with Monika’s maintenance work. She was busy since the morning.<br/>
Because it would be a journey without using connecting coach, we didn’t need to pay attention to a departure schedule. It was appreciated.<br/>
Novem came to me.<br/>
「Lyle-sama, I’ve finished the procedure at the adventurer guild.」<br/>
I asked Novem to take care of the procedure at the guild in my place.<br/>
「My bad. If I’m the one who went they would nag and make snide remarks at me for some reason.」<br/>
Skilled adventurers were leaving from Arumsaas one after another to another region.<br/>
The bad service of the adventurer guild was one reason for that, but would the day come that the staff there recognized it?<br/>
Novem was also making a slightly tired face.<br/>
「The number of adventurers decreased by a lot after all. In addition even we will be leaving so they seem to be troubled.」<br/>
Ludhor, Zalsa, Benir……the malicious adventurers had disappeared, but thanks to that the number of parties entering the dungeon became few. Looking at the whole it didn’t seem like a great number but, if adventurers with great earning like us wanted to leave then the guild would try to hold us back.<br/>
Especially me who caught the eye of Damian. I got persistently nagged by the staffs if I was going to betray this city.<br/>
It helped that Novem went to take care of the procedure in my place.<br/>
「How long is Lyle-sama planning to stay in Centralle?」<br/>
I couldn’t answer right away.<br/>
「Depends on the situation. I also have the feeling that it’s still too early for us to head to the free city Beim, and I also want to take a look at other regions before that. It’ll be nice if there is a good place somewhere.」<br/>
Novem smiled.<br/>
「I believe that Lyle-sama will surely find it. Then, I’ll also go to prepare.」<br/>
Novem also left me in order to pack her own things.<br/>
I yawned and stretched up, then I filled my chest with anticipation of what kind of place we’d head to next.<br/>
Shannon called out to me at that timing. She was holding a candy in her hand.<br/>
「What, you came to complain again?」<br/>
I made fun of her, but recently Shannon’s condition was strange.<br/>
We still quarreled, but sometimes she would look at me with a sad face.<br/>
Just what was she thinking?<br/>
「……Here, for you.」<br/>
Shannon was holding her favorite candy. My eyes opened wide.<br/>
「Is tomorrow going to rain spears? For you to share your candy with me……could it be poisoned?」<br/>
I said jokingly, but Shannon’s reaction was bad.<br/>
She made a face that was about to cry and shook her head. She said to me.<br/>
「I give you this because you’re pitiful. In exchange, please take care of Onee-sama okay? I think that perhaps I won’t be able to stop her.」<br/>
What was this girl saying? Even though I had just confirmed that Miranda-san’s personality wasn’t as bad as I thought, this girl was giving off a tragic feeling by herself.<br/>
I threw the candy I received into my mouth.<br/>
「Ah, this is tasty.」<br/>
Shannon looked at me and made a sad expression.<br/>
「Oi, stop making that face. Just what are you sad about!?」<br/>
「It’s fine. It’s better that you don’t know. But, I’m slightly pitying you. I’m slightly pitying this gigolo bastard for real.」<br/>
「Don’t call me gigolo bastard! You, could it be this is some kind of new harassment!?」<br/>
As I thought──I hated the existence that was like a little sister!<br/>
.<br/>
──Inside the Jewel.<br/>
The group who was watching Lyle getting along with Shannon had serious faces.<br/>
The scene that would usually make them say a joke was met with silence.<br/>
The Fourth looked at the Second.<br/>
The Second who was resolving himself took a small deep breath and then looked at Lyle’s face.<br/>
Lyle who was having an exchange with Shannon as though they were brother and sister had become really tough now even from the view point of the six of them. He was like a completely different person compared to the beginning when he didn’t know left from right.<br/>
The Second opened his mouth.<br/>
"I think it’s time."<br/>
The Third nodded to those words.<br/>
"Yeah. If it’s Lyle right now, it’s not an Art that is beyond him I think? Surely he’ll be fine."<br/>
Lyle had learned the Second’s Art until the second stage.<br/>
Everyone sensed that the time to teach the third stage which was the last stage had arrived.<br/>
The Second scratched his head with an embarrassed look.<br/>
"I also want to watch him for a bit more but, I will just be a nuisance to keep staying here. Lyle is already alright."<br/>
The reason the memory of the ancestors was resurrected was to teach Lyle their Arts.<br/>
At the very least, that was what everyone thought.<br/>
And then, they would vanish just like the First if they finished their role.<br/>
The Second looked at the silver great sword floating silently inside the room of the round table.<br/>
"H~m, as expected in my case a bow will come out I think? Or perhaps it’s only father who was special? Even though it’s weighing my mind the answer won’t come out, don’t you think that’s horrible?"<br/>
Everyone said 「Certainly」 with a small laugh. The Second looked at Lyle with a gentle gaze.<br/>
"……He is also still no good in many things but, I’ll vanish around here."<br/>
The Second decided to entrust his Art to Lyle.<br/>
He believed that if the other ancestors were here, then surely they would guide Lyle.<br/>
The Fourth spoke with a lonely look.<br/>
"It will be lonely."<br/>
The Second smiled with a troubled look.<br/>
"I’ll be sad if you guys are happy instead that I’ll be gone. Well, perhaps it’s just right to come until this far."<br/>
The Third also nodded.<br/>
"That’s also true. In that case, I wonder if I’ll be next in line? I wonder how will Lyle have become when the Seventh vanish."<br/>
The Fifth analyzed jokingly.<br/>
"If he is drawing in woman with heavy love then I think he will end up the same like the Sixth, but even Miranda isn’t a woman with that heavy of a love. It feels like he will be able to handle things well."<br/>
The Sixth’s expression turned sour.<br/>
"I wish you won’t compare him with me. Well, let’s just consider it that right now he is growing nicely."<br/>
Lyle’s grandfather the Seventh was hopelessly concerned with Lyle’s future.<br/>
"To be able to see my grandson becoming adult who can stand on his own. That’s something to be happy about."<br/>
The Second concluded.<br/>
"Yeah. I never thought that I would be able to see my descendant like this. Well, I’m just a memory while the actual person had died already though."<br/>
The Second looked at Lyle who was frolicking with Shannon with a slightly lonely look──<br/>
