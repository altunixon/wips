Change Raph<br/>
"Eh…" (Raphtalia)<br/>
Ah, Raphtalia’s smile became stiff.<br/>
Well it would be eerie if a creature that looked exactly like you were to put on a pretense and take your place.<br/>
It’s that. It’s similar to a doppelgänger.<br/>
When I think about it like that, it seems like a creepy being so it’s quite bizarre.<br/>
However there’s a distinction. They feel different.<br/>
Somehow the real Raphtalia differs a little from my ideal, and it feels better to pet Raph-chan.<br/>
In the end, there’s a gap between my ideal and the real Raphtalia.<br/>
"I can tell them apart when I pet them though." (Naofumi)<br/>
"To pet Raphtalia enough to distinguish between them, you say~ even Onee-san is getting embarrassed~" (Sadina)<br/>
"That’s right… the reason I can tell the difference is because I’ve been travelling with Raphtalia until now." (Naofumi)<br/>
"Naofumi-sama, that conversation is getting…" (Raphtalia)<br/>
Raphtalia’s face turned red.<br/>
As usual, it seems that she’s not good with this subject.<br/>
"Then Raph-chan can become Raphtalia-chan’s body double, right~" (Sadina)<br/>
Sadina said some unnecessary… well, it might be good to consider that.<br/>
To even reproduce Raphtalia’s memories…. certainly, that may be more advanced than just making a homunculus.<br/>
That route is wrong though.<br/>
"Rafu~" (Raph-chan)<br/>
"Geh.. she’s even compatible with Mii-kun’s body. The affinity is the worst… she can possess Mii-kun." (Rat) [T/N: I’m going with female because Raph-chan is Raphtalia’s clone.. kinda]<br/>
"Don’t you dare hurt her." (Naofumi)<br/>
"I won’t. However, I won’t let it go if she does possess Mii-kun." (Rat)<br/>
"Ria~" (Raph-chan)<br/>
Raph-chan nodded once, as if she understood Rat’s threat.<br/>
Somehow she seems to have good perceptiveness.<br/>
"On that note, I’m having you finish making that carriage-type body, but she seems to be helpful. (Naofumi)<br/>
"Yes, she can even activate the cells so the efficiency of my work should be increased." (Rat)<br/>
"That’s good. Even if it’s just that, it’s productive." (Naofumi)<br/>
"Ah, Marquis, if you’re going to raise that child then you should Class her up properly. She should almost be at her limit." (Rat)<br/>
"Got it." (Naofumi)<br/>
Nevertheless, to Class Up at Level 90, huh.<br/>
I originally thought this in Gaelion’s case as well, but what’s the principle behind transcending the Class Up limit?<br/>
….What comes to mind is that it’s because the one being leeched off has had a Class Up maybe? [T/N: Wrath dragon stole Firo’s exp and levels but Gaelion didn’t Class Up until afterwards]<br/>
Like this, Raph-chan’s identity was established.<br/>
So she’s the legacy of the crazy me.<br/>
I didn’t expect anything other than combat.<br/>
By the way, this is something I learned later, but the Raphs with a higher ranked position have power, just like the Filorials. [T/N: Raph Queens (/Kings)]<br/>
It looks like the low ranked Raph obey them.<br/>
"Ah, I discovered an interesting project." (Rat)<br/>
"What is it?" (Naofumi)<br/>
"Marquis, you had Filorial familiars if I’m not mistaken." (Rat)<br/>
"Yeah, they come out even though I don’t call them." (Naofumi)<br/>
""Pii!"" (Filorial Familiars)<br/>
They appeared as if they were called.<br/>
"Try giving one to Raph-chan." (Rat)<br/>
"Hm?" (Naofumi)<br/>
When I transfer one over, Raph-chan held the little Filorial with both hands.<br/>
Just like a raccoon.<br/>
<br/>
"Rafu~" (Raph-chan)<br/>
…..What the hell?<br/>
"Pii." (Filorial familiar)<br/>
And then a short while later it turned into a little Raph.<br/>
….Huh?<br/>
"Let’s see…." (Rat)<br/>
Familiar: Raph was learnt.<br/>
Mode Change: Raph was learnt.<br/>
Familiar Change was learnt.<br/>
"As I expected, it looks like it worked." (Rat)<br/>
"What is this?" (Naofumi)<br/>
"Rafu!" (Familiar)<br/>
The little Raph started dancing with the Filorial familiar.<br/>
It’s slightly bigger than the familiar.<br/>
"To summarise, this is the Expanding the Marquis’s Abilities Plan? It seems there’s a variety of things that are possible like the Filorials." (Rat)<br/>
"Ah.. I see." (Naofumi)<br/>
"If you wanted to restore it…. it seems like you can use something to change it back but do you know, Marquis?" (Rat)<br/>
"For the time being."<br/>
I try using Familiar Change.<br/>
The familiar that turned into a Raph became a Filorial.<br/>
I see, so Raphs can also change into Filorials depending on the situation it’s used in….<br/>
It’s quite elaborate.<br/>
I haven’t finished analysing it but it’s something like this." (Rat)<br/>
"What kind of creature Raph-chan is…. I’ve also learnt a lot." (Naofumi)<br/>
"Rafu~" (Raph-chan)<br/>
Raph-chan bows her head.<br/>
Is that slate your instruction manual or something.<br/>
"What’s the danger of a second or third Raph-chan being born?" (Naofumi)<br/>
"There’s none here but…." (Rat)<br/>
It’s not safe…. while thinking that, I leave the laboratory with Raphtalia.<br/>
Ah, Sadina and Raph-chan are also with us.<br/>
<br/>
After this is…. there’s someone I need to speak to alone.<br/>
"Come to think of it, Granny’s son… where is he?" (Naofumi)<br/>
"He’s training with everyone."<br/>
Right, Granny had a son.<br/>
He had been captivated by Granny’s fancy movements.<br/>
However, I mustn’t forget.<br/>
Granny’s death is unconfirmed at present…. but the party formation is already….<br/>
"I want to speak to him alone. Please don’t follow me." (Naofumi)<br/>
"Understood." (Raphtalia)<br/>
I suppose Raphtalia, the Female Knight and Fohl have conversed with him.<br/>
It’s getting considerably late. It’s time for the villagers to finish training and head to bed.<br/>
At this time of day, many of the older slaves, like Sadina, and the soldiers staying in the village would be having a drink in the Dining Hall.<br/>
I make my way to the Dining hall, if he wasn’t there then I’d head to the house I assigned to Granny.<br/>
Luckily, Granny’s son was drinking alcohol.<br/>
"Is this taken?" (Naofumi)<br/>
I point to the seat beside the Granny’s son.<br/>
"…Go ahead." (Son)<br/>
Granny’s son nodded so I sat down.<br/>
"……"<br/>
Silence rules the surroundings.<br/>
"I’m sorry I couldn’t protect your mother." (Naofumi)<br/>
I break the silence and apologise.<br/>
When I do, Granny’s son puts down his glass and looks downward, absorbed in thought.<br/>
"No…" (Son)<br/>
Granny’s son sinks into silence.<br/>
The silence is heavy.<br/>
"I heard from Raphtalia and the others. I think mother would be satisfied." (Son)<br/>
"But.." (Naofumi)<br/>
Before I could reply, Granny’s son intercepts me with a gentle smile.<br/>
"My mother didn’t originally plan to leave behind the Hengen Musou style. Apparently a lot of things happened when she was younger." (Son)<br/>
"I also heard about that." (Naofumi)<br/>
"However… she wanted to personally help with the Hero of the Shield-sama’s efforts and made the decision to let someone succeed the school that she didn’t even teach me." (Son)<br/>
"Come to think of it… I didn’t see you fighting that much." (Naofumi)<br/>
He’s dressed like what might not be normally understood as a soldier.<br/>
At first, I had thought he was a villager.<br/>
"Yeah… and I didn’t even know that my mother was such a famous person." (Son)<br/>
"Speaking of which… what about your father?" (Naofumi)<br/>
From what I’ve seen, Granny and her son look as distant as grandmother and grandson, rather than parent and child.<br/>
"I’m an orphan. So I’m not related to my mother by blood." (Son)<br/>
"I see…" (Naofumi)<br/>
"Hero of the Shield-sama." (Son)<br/>
"What is it?" (Naofumi)<br/>
"The Hero of the Shield-sama saved my mother’s life. And so she said she wouldn’t have any regrets no matter when she was to die, because the Hero of the Shield-sama bestowed her time."<br/>
This is…. tough.<br/>
Fohl is also the same, but I never thought there would be times where I’d consider it better to be hated.<br/>
"Because she met the Hero of the Shield-sama, my mother shined the brightest I’ve ever seen. That’s why I only feel gratitude towards the Hero of the Shield-sama. If my mother sacrificed herself to let everyone escape and so the Hero of the Shield-sama could live, then…" (Son)<br/>
"……" (Naofumi)<br/>
"We spent all our savings to purchase Yggdrasil medicine to extend her life but… if it was just me, I’m sure mother wouldn’t have been able to live as long as she did. The time was increased, I was taught to fight and got stronger because of the Hero of the Shield-sama’s miracle." (Son)<br/>
Fohl also said something similar.<br/>
Yggdrasil medicine, that medicine…. it gave me a bitter duty.<br/>
It’s karma.<br/>
"Hengen Musou is a style that exists for weak people to destroy the evil. My mother didn’t die in vain. Hero of the Shield-sama, please, my mother’s will…. let us succeed it. So if you’re troubled, take a step forward, you don’t have to worry about me." (Son)<br/>
"But…" (Naofumi)<br/>
"I have a dream. The part of the Hengen Musou style that was lost when my mother was lost, that part… I believe it will be resurrected if it’s here. So, Hero-sama… Please let me join you in fighting to protect the world. For my mother’s sake as well." (Son)<br/>
"….I understand. I don’t know when you might die though? Are you still fine with that?" (Naofumi)<br/>
"The Hengen Musou style will live on through this village. Even if I end up dying, it won’t be a complete death." (Son)<br/>
"Is that so, you’re strong." (Naofumi)<br/>
In that case, I will live up to her wishes.<br/>
I will defeat Tact with the Hengen Musou style.<br/>
After that, I exchanged a few drinks with Granny’s son and then retired to bed.<br/>
In a few days, the war and wave will come.<br/>
The preparations are complete. I’ve done all that I need to.<br/>
And thus, the war began.<br/>
<br/>
