Translator Note:<br/>
Yes, RL hits you sometimes. I have college and work. I have been tired as of late and I have been catching up with the novels I couldnâ€™t read lately.<br/>
So here it is, a bit late but its here ðŸ˜› (Not like thereâ€™s a schedule for them though)<br/>
Enjoy the chapter ðŸ˜€<br/>
â€”â€“<br/>
[You leave me no choice. Then, I will be doing the last one] (Makoto)<br/>
"Eh?!" (Rinon)<br/>
The first thing that came out was the wonder of Rinon.<br/>
*fidget*fidget. Just how low are her expectations of me?<br/>
"U-Um Raidou-san? We will be doing as well you know?! Letâ€™s ask Mio do it!"<br/>
The other people are also desperately trying to stop.<br/>
A tear-jerking assessment must mean something like this.<br/>
I couldnâ€™t even collect raw materials so I can tell how much of a novice they think I am.<br/>
I rummage for my bow and arrow and take them out. I exchange looks with Mio and stop the carriage.<br/>
As expected of the bicorn horse-san. He isnt even fazed by the strong looking bugs that are heading straight to us. He is listening to my orders by the letter.<br/>
Uhm, the antâ€™s weak point was the head right? Where was it for the bees?<br/>
[Uhm, the weak point of the Size Antâ€™s the head right? The one called Rubee-eye, was it the head?] (Makoto)<br/>
"Thatâ€™s why I told you its impossible!"<br/>
"Also, for the Rubee-eye, its no good if you only aim at the head!!"<br/>
"You havenâ€™t heard about them, to fight them isâ€¦!"<br/>
They are really telling me off. I will cry you know? But, they certainly did tell me not to aim for the head, I messed up a bit.<br/>
[Its fine, just tell me where I should be aiming at for the Rubee-eye, please] (Makoto)<br/>
"Uwaâ€¦ This guy intends to shoot without even knowing the range of a bow!"<br/>
"Please, we can still convince Mio to do it"<br/>
"â€¦ The weakness of the Rubee-eye, if I remember correctly, its the abdomen-desu" (Toa)<br/>
"Hey Toa?!"<br/>
Toa silences the noisy bunch. Umu, this girl has good eyes. It seems that she was able to see my ability the moment I took a stance with the bow. Fufu, I am scared of myself.<br/>
The head and the abdomen huh.<br/>
Hmph, with â€˜how closeâ€™ they are, there is no way for me to miss.<br/>
If itâ€™s just archery it would be another case, but I also master the art of archery. If its necessary I can even do close quarter combat. Ah, thatâ€™s right. Next time, lets ask the dwarfs-san to make â€˜thatâ€™ for me.<br/>
I am of course, used to moving enemies.<br/>
I prepare my bow. There are still a lot of arrows that the dwarfs gave me. There is no problems with this equipment.<br/>
(Hey hey, Toa?!)<br/>
(Shut up! It looks like he is concentrating) (Toa)<br/>
(No, like I am telling you, its impossible. This distance is something only magic can manage)<br/>
(And also, he is a level 1. What is he thinking?)<br/>
These bunch, h-how disrespectful. The words of the calm elf-looking girl pierce right though my heart. Even though she calls Mio with honorifics!<br/>
But from the 10 enemies I have already locked on 6 of them.<br/>
7, 8, 9â€¦<br/>
Then, lets answer the expectations of Toa-san.<br/>
Is what I thought butâ€¦<br/>
(If push comes to shove we still have Mio-sama with us) (Toa)<br/>
(Oh, I see. We are going to let him do what he wants and have her move out)<br/>
(Also, he might be someone awesome if Mio-sama left it to him)<br/>
(â€¦ No no noâ€¦ Thatâ€™s impossible for a level 1)<br/>
(Itâ€™s not Raidou-san, itâ€™s that bow. It may be an incredible object. It may have something like aiming or critical that will kill them off in one hit) (Toa)<br/>
(â€¦ I see, I didnâ€™t think about that. Certainly, leaving the bow aside, the arrows are pretty well made)<br/>
The damn that keeps the tears of my heart might break down at any point. You go straight to denying my own ability?<br/>
Itâ€™s the bow huh!<br/>
Should I make you all aiming targets?! All you foolsâ€¦ uhâ€¦<br/>
I donâ€™t care anymore! Just watch and be amazed!<br/>
"Onii-chan, are you okay?" (Rinon)<br/>
Jeez, I am beginning to see Rinon as the sweetest girl here.<br/>
The distance is around a 100 meters huh.<br/>
I have finished locking on all the enemies. Lets begin with the bees.<br/>
"â€¦ Fu~"<br/>
I quietly let out the air in my lungs. And then, the first arrow. From the two Rubee-eye that were leading the group, one was brought down.<br/>
Following that, another one. Of course, the bee from just now had a hole in its abdomen and fell to the ground.<br/>
3, 4, 5â€¦<br/>
I was smoothly locking them on and bringing them down.<br/>
From my back I could hear things like â€˜No wayâ€™ or â€˜What is going on?â€™, did you see that you bastards?<br/>
Do you understand now? When I use a bow I am pretty incredible you know?<br/>
I may have the worst face but in my department I can be considered the best.<br/>
8, 9â€¦<br/>
With this one itâ€™s the end, *tou.<br/>
The last antâ€™s head is pierced.<br/>
It has been 30 seconds.<br/>
The enemy was surprised by the first attack so they stopped their movements, by the time I began my moves it was already over.<br/>
I didnâ€™t let a single one get close. I defeated them all with one hit! Donâ€™t underestimate the super-strong long range class!<br/>
Umu, I am a bit rusty in my loading speed but my accuracy has no change. I havenâ€™t been to Asora for a while so I havenâ€™t been able to practice my bow, I am relieved now.<br/>
"â€¦ Incredible" (Rinon)<br/>
I thank you for your honest opinion Rinon. With this they should have changed their opinion of me. Umu umu.<br/>
[Itâ€™s as easy as this. Have you changed your way of seeing me?] (Makoto)<br/>
I say it to the bunch at the back. More like, I will show them all that this bow has no special traits to it.<br/>
"In-credible. Even though I only see it as a normal bowâ€¦"<br/>
Thatâ€™s-why-I-am-saying itâ€™s NOT the bow!<br/>
Just how much is their disbelief? Is being a level 1 such a deciding factor? Damn it.<br/>
[â€¦ This bow is a normal bow. By the way, the arrows are made by skilled artisans but there is no magic in them. I have been specialized in the bow since little] (Makoto)<br/>
Saying that, I give the bow and arrow to them. I did an incredible act and yet, for some reason, my heart feels dejected.<br/>
I order Mio and have us advance through the place where the corpses are.<br/>
Heh~ Its true, this one is different from the Red Bee, the eyes shine like gems. Rubee-eye, I understand now.<br/>
"This, the making was done well but, without doubt, there is no magic placed in them"<br/>
An alchemist young man checked my bow and said his conclusion. Of course, I forgot his name.<br/>
And to remember the name of a rude person, I will not remember them anymore. To not believe what they have seen with their own eyes.<br/>
"â€¦ Imposible"<br/>
An elf woman that uses a bow just as me, whispered lowly. Her name is on the lowest of my priorities.<br/>
"The strength, range, accuracy, I have never seen such a thing"<br/>
"Right" (Toa)<br/>
Toa shares the same opinion. They were thinking it was the tools performance all this time so this must be out of their expectations. <TN: weird, I thought Toa saw Makoto send Mio and Tomoe out the windowâ€¦ or was she sleeping with Rinon?><br/>
I am also a level 1 after all.<br/>
[Everyone, is it fine now? Lets collect the materials quickly and head to Tsige] (Makoto)<br/>
Going ahead, I move next to the Size Ant and cut off the sharp foreleg that looks like a sickle while I hurry the 4 people that were checking out the bow.<br/>
At these times, having writing to communicate is good. If I just write it in the place I want then I can transmit what I want, even in places where my voice canâ€™t reach.<br/>
I am not used to calling people in a high voice.<br/>
The four people come hurriedly.<br/>
It must be because we have been together for several weeks, even though they are not in a party of any sort, they have formed a collective feel in them.<br/>
And after that, in the time we were arriving to Tsige.<br/>
The 4 people that were looking at me as if I were a different person, it felt a bit pleasant.<br/>
When Rinon saw through my feelings and said â€˜Isnâ€™t it great?â€™ I felt a bit embarrassed.<br/>
It has been three weeks since the destruction of the base. It has already been two weeks since we came â€˜hereâ€™.<br/>
When the day was already at its zenith.<br/>
We finally arrived at Tsige. It was the first place that looked like a proper town since I came to this world.<br/>
â€”-<br/>
"What?! The â€˜Zennoâ€™ base has been destroyed?!"<br/>
Toa-san reports the details to the adventurer guild.<br/>
Of course, she didnâ€™t report the whole truth about it.<br/>
I had 3 other adventurers inserted as well, make a good story and have their stories match.<br/>
I havenâ€™t told Toa-san and Rinon about what I did. She must be thinking that her story matches that of other people.<br/>
Anyways, that town, no, that base had such a name like â€˜Zennoâ€™, itâ€™s the first time I have heard of that.<br/>
The average level was over 100, for a town of hyumans that place was quite the place. If you think that those kind of people had disappeared in a moment, itâ€™s actually an impressive occurrence.<br/>
Well, it was a place that ran in a dirty way.<br/>
These people as well, in the end, were sacrifices for those evil merchants or nobles (because of various reasons I wasnâ€™t able to obtain the name of the one behind all)<br/>
That may be why but, it seems that the people here donâ€™t have that much of an attachment to that place.<br/>
Rinon is also like that butâ€¦ it seems that Toa-san had her own reasons.<br/>
She didnâ€™t have any objections in leaving that place but it seems that she has some lingering feelings.<br/>
By the way, the story that was made was incredibly random.<br/>
Just a single thing. The big outbreak of mamonos.<br/>
Even though it wasnâ€™t that strange of an occurrence given the place, I felt it sounded like a web-novel event.<br/>
And so, we ran away for our lives and arrived here.<br/>
Also the guild that my two followers had registered to, wasnâ€™t able to relay the information of them to the other guilds so the information of Tomoe and Mioâ€™s cards has disappeared.<br/>
I donâ€™t know how they do it but how sloppy of them.<br/>
When I asked the details from the base that was near it, they said that the establishment of the base at the borders that shares the information, canâ€™t leave the place so itâ€™s normal for the information to travel slowly.<br/>
When I asked them where this establishment was, they said that it was in Tsige and that we could redo the registration of the two.<br/>
Because of the circumstances we had to go through 3 other bases but they were all village level, no, it gave me the impression of a campground.<br/>
I will call back Tomoe tonight, tomorrow I will have both of them do the registration again, and then I will go to the merchant guild.<br/>
Today I will look for an inn and check out the shopsâ€¦<br/>
Wu wu, finally, finally I have arrived at a town! I have a lot of things I want to do!<br/>
The person in charge that was listening to the four people, nodded his head, told them to wait and then went inside.<br/>
He probably went to look for a higher up. Itâ€™s a pretty important issue after all, for a base to be gone.<br/>
Mio didnâ€™t join in the conversation and was just standing beside me with Rinon. I donâ€™t want another problem caused by my appearance.<br/>
Now that I think about it, just how high is the strongest level and rank in this place?<br/>
Itâ€™s a quite big and pretty well made building so itâ€™s hard to look for itâ€¦ Oh, there it is. There is no need for me to be there when they report so, I just go there for a second.<br/>
I direct my eyes to a side of the request board. From the people that are not so hurried I can tell that this is the place.<br/>
Letâ€™s see, the number 1 here isâ€¦<br/>
Level 201, Rank S.<br/>
Fumu, as expected, itâ€™s low. A starter is a starter and my followers are my followers after all. I donâ€™t even know what the standard is anymore.<br/>
The quest are also pretty low in rank.<br/>
With how this is, the rank S are probably requested personally to an individual or a party.<br/>
Most of the ones left are A or B so the parties are mostly fighting over the D to Bâ€™s, maybe?<br/>
Anyways, the collecting quests that are rank A are a lot, impressive.<br/>
They must be absurdly tiresome, are they requesting to gather something like lost metals?<br/>
â€¦ Either way, I donâ€™t like it. I donâ€™t want to do it either.<br/>
But, I should ask which one is easier to go for the collecting types at the very least. I feel that I can â€˜useâ€™ that.<br/>
At â€˜Zennoâ€™, because of the evil schemes that Tomoe had and a lot of other circumstances I didnâ€™t have the chance to do it. She told me that her individual mobilization is advancing somehow but we have to start for real now.<br/>
N? How unusual, there is an S rank left. I couldnâ€™t reach it with my height so I jumped a bit and take the request.<br/>
Maybe I stood out a bit, the surroundings grew noisy. Well, there seemed to be no one taking it so there wasnâ€™t any competition over it.<br/>
Lets see, what is it?<br/>
â€˜I ask of you! We needÂ at least 1 Rubee-eye eye. To finish we need 6 of them. We will surely give you a large sum of money for them. Rembrandt Companyâ€™<br/>
Timely!<br/>
Moreover, a person from a company huh. This is good. I am lucky. What if I make personal connections from the get go?<br/>
Their name is Rembrandt Company so maybe itâ€™s a pretty big business. Itâ€™s an S rank request so the reward must be quite high.<br/>
Umu, I should tell this to the other guys and have them give me all of the Rubee-eye eyes. I was the one who hunted them so there shouldnâ€™t be any problems.<br/>
If it comes to it I can even take them by force. After all, even if they all come at me, Mio alone can mess them up, kukuku *evil smile*<br/>
"Onii-chan, you look a bit scary" (Rinon)<br/>
"Waka-sama, an evil plan-desu ka?" (Mio)<br/>
The scared Rinon and the â€˜count me inâ€™ Mio. The side of Rinon hurts me.<br/>
[Thatâ€™s not it Rinon. I just found an interesting request] (Makoto)<br/>
"Hmph~, ah, Onee-chan and the others!" (Rinon)<br/>
The talk is over huh.<br/>
When I look, there is certainly 4 people coming here.<br/>
I glance at the rank table for a bit.<br/>
When I think about it, if itâ€™s the top 10 then Toa and the dwarf girlÂ can enter in it. So they can enter in the strong part even when they are like that. Umuâ€¦<br/>
Honestly, I can only think of them as a noisy bunch.<br/>
The person of the guild seems to not be here. It looks like it didnâ€™t become a troublesome matter.<br/>
â€˜To explain the situationâ€™ was a request that we got in the previous base. They showed the document to prove that, so this is practically a direct request from the guild.<br/>
They look quite happy about that.<br/>
"I am back, Rinon. You didnâ€™t cause any troubles to the two of them right?" (Toa)<br/>
"I was behaving properly!"<br/>
The conversation of sisters~ how nice~ having a sister. I had too but, no, I canâ€™t think about that.<br/>
Rinon was being a really good girl.<br/>
[Welcome back, did you finish the request properly?] (Makoto)<br/>
"Yeah, thanks to you. But are you okay with it? I think that the 2 of you could receive the reward for completing the request" (Toa)<br/>
I am grateful for the consideration of Toa-san but, if I said that â€˜We have increased our rank while you werenâ€™t here Tomoe, we took a request, and did our bestâ€™<br/>
I am sure it will become an annoying situation.<br/>
If I think about the situation and atmosphere until now, I feel that even if we donâ€™t try so hard for it, we will be able to increase our rank.<br/>
[No no, our reputation as adventurers is too low so, this time I will give it to you guys] (Makoto)<br/>
I see! With this as trade condition, I can get the eyes! <TN: No seriously. You were the one who got them anyways><br/>
"For all the things you have done for us, I am truly grateful"<br/>
What a proper young man.<br/>
"Experience, money, rank and materials, you have truly helped us out. I pray that Raidou-dono can have the blessing of the spirits"<br/>
The dwarf girl.<br/>
"Tell me where you learned to use the bow later"<br/>
The elf girl. That is impossible.<br/>
"Thanks to you, we have increased our level and rank. Its like a dream. Here here" (Toa)<br/>
Toa-san. Her caution is fading~<br/>
Lets see. Everyone is happily showing me their guild cards.<br/>
Toa-san is level 125, Rank A, Shadow Thief. What does Shadow Thief mean? What a dangerous name, there is no doubt I donâ€™t want to get close to something like that.<br/>
The dwarf girl is, level 122, Rank B+, Priest Warrior (Earth). It must mean that she is a knight that can use earth spirits.<br/>
The proper young man is, level 114, Rank B+, Alchemy Meister. Canâ€™t they just call it alchemist? It sounds like he can even ride a Gundam, oi.<br/>
The elf girl is, level 108, Rank A-, Bless Gunner. A gunner you say? She uses guns?! But you are holding a bow?! This world had guns?!<br/>
Certainly. Every one of them has leveled up.<br/>
The elf girl was not even level 100 after all, she leveled up quite a bit.<br/>
That means that, I, who has worked so hard, must have increased at least 30 levels, maybe?<br/>
[Our business here is over so letâ€™s leave. Or, do you guys still have something to do here?] (Makoto)<br/>
"We donâ€™t have any but, Mio-sama and Raidou-san must register"<br/>
All of them nod simultaneously. Impressive synchronization.<br/>
Why is it that you guys are looking forward to it?<br/>
[We plan on doing that when Tomoe reunites with us so, we are not going to do it today. Tomoe will sulk if we donâ€™t do that] (Makoto)<br/>
"If its Tomoe-san, she would sulk. You are right" (Mio)<br/>
Mio also understands very well that point.<br/>
Even though she is taking separate conduct right now, she is the type that would mind if we donâ€™t do the critical things together.<br/>
"Eh~? I wanted to see everyone surprised though~!" (Toa)<br/>
Toa-san, what an irresponsible thing to say.<br/>
[We are going to come here tomorrow so, if you are here tomorrow you will be able to see] (Makoto)<br/>
Itâ€™s sudden but we are in different lodgings, no, we are separating, thatâ€™s how this is.<br/>
I canâ€™t carry them around all the time after all.<br/>
Because our objective is to have a pleasure trip around the various countries, or something like that.<br/>
Also, it seems that in this world you canâ€™t make a party with other adventurers if there is a certain difference of level between them.<br/>
The system that the adventurers utilize to make big parties, itâ€™s too unbalanced for us.<br/>
If Iâ€™m not mistakenâ€¦<br/>
"â€¦ You are right, until now we had to accompany you but, certainly, from now on our destinations are going to differ a lot"<br/>
"Raidou-dono, its hard to believe but if he is going to be walking the path of a company business then it will certainly be different"<br/>
"If the level difference is of 20 or more, it wonâ€™t be allowed"<br/>
It was 20 huh. Then Tomoe and Mio canâ€™t form one either.<br/>
[Yeah, thatâ€™s why, lets eat something light for lunch and distribute the luggage of the carriage. After that we will be going our ways for now] (Makoto)<br/>
"For now?" (Toa)<br/>
Toa-san asks me back with a hint of expectation. I canâ€™t answer that expectation though, I have some kind of feelings as well so, I am thinking about it too.<br/>
[If everyone is not in a hurry, we can go together for lunch and then do a farewell party. In commemoration for the success of your guild request] (Makoto)<br/>
"We are in!"<br/>
I thank you for your consent.<br/>
"Waka-sama. I donâ€™t want something like last time-desu yo" (Mio)<br/>
Mio, I understand what you are trying to say. This time we will be going to a bar-like place to munch as much as we want.<br/>
Also, we have been eating preserved food and a lot of other things that had no flavor so.<br/>
[You are right, Mio. Everyone has come here in the past right?] (Makoto)<br/>
Each one of them nods. Then I will leave it to them.<br/>
[Then I will leave it to you guys, so please choose a place where we can eat a lot of food and drink at ease. I will be eagerly expecting it] (Makoto)<br/>
[Of course, a place that is fine for Rinon-chan to be] (Makoto)<br/>
I add words to what I said.<br/>
Then, the night has been decided so, for now its lunch. A place where we can lightly pick up and distribute, where we can converse huh. Umu, letâ€™s have them do that as well.<br/>
[Then, letâ€™s go] (Makoto)<br/>
