I started to explore the surrounding area in order to procure food. I’ll start by going around the lake.<br/>
In this situation, the first possible food item which comes to mind was fish, but I was not sure if there were any present and I also lack fishing implements for catching them. I could shoot it with the rifle if a big enough specimen appeared, but retrieving it would be a pain. Let’s put that plan on hold first.<br/>
Guess I’ll go for plant-life then. But it was difficult to spot the edible ones without the proper knowledge.<br/>
I resorted to using Nanom to check them by kneading the leaves between my fingers until fluids came out and having Nanom scan them afterward.<br/>
I started to indiscriminately knead the leaves of all the plants I could manage to lay my eyes on.<br/>
(Is it really possible to procure consumable nutrients from the local plant-life?)<br/>
[It’s possible. But the plant you’re holding isn’t edible.]<br/>
[Unsuitable for consumption.]<br/>
[Unsuitable for consumption.]<br/>
……<br/>
[Possible to take in and digest.]<br/>
Alright! But when I tried to put it in my mouth, it turned out tasting really godawful. I immediately spat it out and instructed Nanom to only point out the things which could be considered as food.<br/>
<br/>
[Suitable as food.]<br/>
Great, I finally got one! I tried the leaves but they tasted really bad. I tried the stem but it was the same. I pulled it out from the ground and saw a small tuber-like bulb growing from the roots with a size of about three centimeters. When I tried eating it, it tasted like raw potatoes.<br/>
It wasn’t exactly delicious, but the taste may change if I baked it a little. Okay, let’s gather these for today.<br/>
While I was preoccupied with gathering the potato look-alikes, a rodent resembling both a rabbit and a mouse appeared about 30 meters away. It was frozen on the spot when our eyes met. Was this thing edible?<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Okay, wise guy. You’re cute, but I’ll still have you serve as my meal.<br/>
I quickly put up my rifle and finished it off with one shot. I estimated the rabbit-like, rat-like creature to be about 5 kilograms after I came closer to have a look. Its ears were too small for a rabbit’s but too big to be those of a rat’s.<br/>
When I shoved my finger inside the wound opened by the rifle shot, Nanom judged it to be suitable as food so I decided to bring it back.<br/>
I decided to name it ‘mouse-rabbit’. It sounded more edible than ‘rabbit-mouse’ in any case. But well, they’re both rodents so I guess anything’s good.<br/>
I managed to gather twenty pieces of mock-potatoes and hunted myself a mouse-rabbit. It’s about time to return to the rocky hill.<br/>
I managed to procure food surprisingly easily. If things went like this all the time, then I might just manage to survive somehow.<br/>
I decided to dismantle my quarry at the lakeside before I go back to the rocky outcrop to start cooking. I dismembered the creature I hunted while listening to the instructions given out by Nanom.<br/>
Hmm, the parts suitable for being eaten were lesser in amount than expected. Just the two front legs and two hind legs to be exact. About a kilo’s worth of meat I guess. If I took away the bones, it would be around 700 grams, give or take. Can I use the fur for something? I couldn’t think of any obvious uses for it at the moment. I don’t even have any idea how to use it in the first place. It’s unfortunate, but I’ll have to dispose of it.<br/>
Then I suddenly remembered something.<br/>
(Escape pod, please respond.)<br/>
I tried to contact the pod once more, but there was still no response. Well, since Iris was now gone, I didn’t really feel that disappointed about this outcome.<br/>
I went back to the rocky hill and started prepping the mouse-rabbit meat for cooking. I haven’t tried cooking outdoors since I was in junior officer school. I’m kinda getting fired up about this.<br/>
I gathered some firewood and lit them up with my laser gun.<br/>
Cooking can be said to be my only hobby. I couldn’t really do it while onboard a ship, but I sometimes borrowed a multipurpose room whenever we were stationed on a base and treated the rest of my squad with my cooking.<br/>
At times when I couldn’t cook, I researched various recipes and scoured gourmet sites for useful info.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
I might only be roasting some pieces of meat, but it’s definitely no simple task. Guess it’s really hard to cook properly without using kitchen tools huh?… Well, technically, I wasn’t really cooking but just holding the meat over an open fire.<br/>
I finally managed to roast a piece of leg skewered on a tree branch.<br/>
When I bit into the well-roasted thigh meat, I found its taste to be kinda like chicken. It was slightly gamey, but it was tolerable.<br/>
But honestly, it was hard to place the taste. If one asked me if it was delicious or not, I’d probably answer ‘neither’. It wasn’t awful, but I couldn’t exactly call it tasty either.<br/>
In the first place, only the natural taste of the meat was present since I didn’t use any spices or condiments like salt. I might have expected a tad too much since it took no small amount of effort to dismantle it, gather firewood and cook the thing.<br/>
But I think it’ll definitely taste better if I used some salt.<br/>
Salt, huh… Is it possible to secure some rock salt nearby?<br/>
It’s already evening now. I’ll go look for some tomorrow morning. Since it was a waste otherwise, I proceeded to wolf down the rest of the meat.<br/>
I managed to get full just from eating meat. What should I do with those mock-potatoes I gathered? I placed the mock-potatoes on top of the smoldering remains of the bonfire and lightly covered them with soil on top.<br/>
This should bake them quite nicely. Well, I guess it’s fine even if this didn’t work out.<br/>
Since it’s already gotten quite dark, I decided to hit the sack.<br/>
(Alert Mode on. Wake me up at dawn.)<br/>
[Acknowledged.]<br/>
<br/>
[It is now dawn. Please wake up.]<br/>
Hah. It looks like I slept well last night. The morning sunlight looks dazzling. Wait, that reminds me…!<br/>
(Hey Nanom, exactly how many hours is one full day on this planet?)<br/>
[Approximately 24 hours.]<br/>
So it’s roughly the same as my home planet.<br/>
Let’s take a look at those mock-potatoes which underwent my cooking experiment. Some parts looked burnt and some parts didn’t. I peeled one and tried tasting it.<br/>
Hey, these are pretty good! They do taste like regular baked potatoes. This will be my breakfast for today.<br/>
"I really wish I had some salt and cooking tools right now," I thought to myself while in the middle of scarfing down the baked mock-potatoes. One really can’t help but want the things they don’t have.<br/>
I plan to explore and search for food items again today. I gotta do my best.<br/>
For starters, I’ll continue surveying the areas around the lake. The entire lakeshore area should stretch out to more than fifteen kilometers. There were animal trails present, so I didn’t have much difficulty walking around the place.<br/>
Once I find some new plant types, I’ll immediately start pressing them between my fingers.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
A [Suitable as food.] response came out soon after. It looks just like normal grass, but it was emitting a subtle aroma, so it might be a type of herb. The taste wasn’t bad as well. I pocketed five bundles of stalks.<br/>
When I walked about halfway around the lake, I managed to reach a large river which branched out from it. Well, since it was such a large lake, discovering a river wasn’t really all that surprising.<br/>
I gazed at the river intently. If there was a river here, then following it should eventually lead me out to sea. I confirmed the existence of said sea when I checked out the external monitor during the escape pod’s descent.<br/>
If I went to the sea, I should probably manage to acquire some salt. This definitely needs to be considered.<br/>
I crossed the large river by jumping over it. With nanom-enhanced musculature, jumping over a 5-meter wide river was quite easy, even without doing a run-up.<br/>
I’d walked around for a while and kneaded quite a bit of plant matter before finally finding something suitable for eating.<br/>
It looked like a type of leafy vegetable. It tasted fine when I tried it. I can probably use it to make a salad or something.<br/>
I also pocketed five bundles of them.<br/>
After walking a while more, I managed to spot a boar-like creature drinking water from the lakeshore. It was about 400 meters away.<br/>
Although I kinda do feel sorry for it, I’ll have it serve as dinner for tonight. I have to secure as much food as possible after all.<br/>
I pulled out my rifle and obtained a lock. A distance of 400 meters was nothing before this baby’s zoom-in function.<br/>
After sufficient magnification was gained, I immediately pulled the trigger. The boar-like creature had already fallen the moment the sound of a plasma round firing rang out.<br/>
When I approached my quarry, I found it to be quite larger than expected. It’s definitely more than a hundred kilograms.<br/>
Its tusks were a good bit larger than the wild boar I was familiar with. It wouldn’t be wrong to call this creature a fanged boar due to these tusks measuring more than 30 centimeters. You’d definitely bite the dust if you get stabbed by these things.<br/>
Nature really can’t be underestimated. There were dangerous creatures like this running around after all.<br/>
Nanom judged it to be suitable as food.<br/>
But getting something so large was troublesome for me. Even if I managed to procure lots of meat, I don’t have any means to refrigerate them for preservation. I couldn’t possibly finish them all in one sitting either. And the only cooking method available to me right now was roasting de-boned meat over an open fire.<br/>
Since it couldn’t be helped, I settled for cutting off one hind leg with my knife and brought along just that. Even one hind leg could account for 10 kilograms of meat.<br/>
After walking some distance away while looking around, I suddenly heard the sound of splashing water. When I turned back, I saw the remains of the wild boar get taken by ‘something’ from within the lake. ‘It’ easily pulled down that huge boar-creature with room to spare.<br/>
I got flustered and hurriedly took some distance away from the lake.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
There was that huge boar and that mysterious creature as well. The reason I remained safe until now could be said to be all thanks to sheer dumb luck. I renewed my resolve to be even more careful.<br/>
I managed to safely return to the rocky hill while remaining alert for possible threats.<br/>
When I woke up earlier, I kinda felt like taking a bath in the lake water. But after seeing what happened just now, I won’t do it even if I was offered a huge sum of money to do so.<br/>
But as expected, one couldn’t help but feel uncomfortable after missing a bath for two days straight. What should I do…?<br/>
For now, I’ll just have a meal first.<br/>
The fire wouldn’t be able to wrap around it properly if I just put the whole leg over it as is, so I sliced it into thinner pieces and skewered said pieces with thin tree branches.<br/>
The meat was done in a jiffy. I took some of the herbs I got earlier and tore them to little pieces. I mixed them with the meat and the salad-use vegetables and ate them altogether.<br/>
This thing’s quite delicious! It was overflowing with meat juices and had a sort of ‘wild’ flavor. There was still no salt, but this was a nice enough delicacy. The herbs and vegetables definitely made the difference.<br/>
I ate ravenously and stuffed myself full in no time. I could now barely classify this as a proper dish.<br/>
There was still a lot of meat left so I’ll save them for tomorrow. It shouldn’t go bad in just one day.<br/>
After satisfying my stomach, I proceeded to think about the things I managed to discover today: the large river, fanged boar and that mysterious creature residing within the lake waters.<br/>
After successfully procuring some water and food yesterday, I felt that the area around the lake wasn’t as dangerous as expected. But it seems that was a hasty conclusion.<br/>
If I follow the direction of the large river, I’d reach the sea. Salt and seafood were both very tempting prospects.<br/>
But I’m still mostly unfamiliar with this planet. If I rushed into things without sufficient info, that might lead to me losing my life.<br/>
From the way things were going, the probability of me living and dying while remaining all alone on this planet was quite high.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
There was no internet. There were no other people to talk to. There weren’t any forms of entertainment. The only thing to look forward to was probably eating.<br/>
When I thought as such, an impulse to go adventuring suddenly came over me.<br/>
In order to live enjoyably and have no regrets, I’ll have to take some risks. Yeah, that doesn’t sound too bad.<br/>
I’m getting really fired up now.<br/>
Alright! I’ll follow the river and go out to sea! I don’t plan to live like a recluse in this kind of place. I’m gonna go on an adventure! I’ve now retired from the military. From this moment on, I’m an adventurer!<br/>
Once I’ve decided as such, I proceeded to prep everything for my departure tomorrow. I plan to pack the remaining meat to serve as my meal provisions for the journey.<br/>
I couldn’t just shove them directly inside my backpack, so I looked around for something to wrap them with and found a plant with long, wide leaves. I tried pressing on them with my fingers.<br/>
[Not suitable as food.]<br/>
(Would there be any problems if I just used them as packaging materials?)<br/>
[There are no problems.]<br/>
I grabbed a whole bunch of the leaves and did some trial and error. I finally managed to make something that could serve as food wrap after a few tries. The key was to weave them together.<br/>
I sliced the rest of the meat. I was worried about getting food poisoning, so I decided to properly cook it all tomorrow.<br/>
Next, I gathered some more mock-potatoes on the way to the lake. I secured some drinking water from the lake itself.<br/>
Hey! That’s right. I can probably take a bath if I simply just fetched some water from the lake to use. I don’t really have to bathe in the lake itself.<br/>
I finished all my preparations in no time. It was already quite dark, so I guess it’s time to sleep.<br/>
