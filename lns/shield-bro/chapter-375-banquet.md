Chapter 375: Banquet<br/>
That day, we returned to the castle town with the mood for a party.<br/>
No matter where we look, people celebrate our victory as they offer thanks to the Heroes.<br/>
According to them, after the Bitch Goddess’s Descent, the sand in the Dragon Hourglasses floated in place within them, but now they’ve fallen, and grown quiet.<br/>
It no longer moves to signal the next wave, and it’s silent, or should I say that at a glance, you can tell that it no longer has a purpose besides being used for Class Ups.<br/>
And the shape of the Sky, or something changed, as the people sensed that peace had fallen onto the world.<br/>
Oh right, on the way back, monsters approached us, and lowered their heads.<br/>
According to Gaelion, now that the world’s calmed down, they no longer have to live in fear… so they came to offer their thanks to the Heroes who brought it about.<br/>
That situation seems suspicious, but looking at the tranquil sky, I start to believe him.<br/>
Well, the Bitch Goddess’s presence’s been cut off.<br/>
I deployed a barrier around the world, so gods of the same type as that Bitch couldn’t come closer anymore.<br/>
The waves won’t come again due to someone taking up the position of God.<br/>
My next course of action will probably be decided after talking with many different people.<br/>
"Thank you, Hero-sama~! Thank you!"<br/>
I hear a call like that from everywhere, and there’s before I could enter the castle, I was roped into a parade.<br/>
As always, I can’t get used to this.<br/>
Back then I wanted to destroy this world, though…<br/>
Even so, I think Melromark’s changed greatly.<br/>
Right now, Humans and Demi-Humans exist in the Castle Town just fine, and they all offer us their blessings.<br/>
There are 20 Heroes… that’s a bit much.<br/>
Perhaps Trash understood that, as he split up the four legendary, and put me as the main attraction at the back of the procession.<br/>
I thought that was a bit mean, but when I confirmed the front of it with my power, I ended up asking myself, ‘Who the Hell is that? Is He also a Hero?’<br/>
The soldiers kindly explained that he was a Hero from Glass’s world or something.<br/>
Of course, the inhabitants of her world were able to sense the world’s change as well. They partook in the celebrations.<br/>
I mean, we stole the weapons from those reincarnators that made quite a mess of their world. I guess they’re overjoyed.<br/>
"Fuu…"<br/>
I entered the castle, and experienced a feeling of relief…<br/>
"The Hero of the Shield-sama is in attendance!"<br/>
Party crackers go off, and the world’s nobles come to greet me.<br/>
Ah, will my soul find no repose?<br/>
"I’m sorry, but I’m a bit tired…" (Naofumi)<br/>
Mostly mentally, though.<br/>
Because of the various powers circulating through my body, I think I would be able to go a few centuries without sleep.<br/>
It’s not like my mind really needs to rest either. I just want some peace and quiet.<br/>
"That is something that everyone understands. The people in attendance here were also part of the war."<br/>
The Queen and Trash explain it to me.<br/>
No, I knew that already.<br/>
"Then I understand you guys’ feelings of having to celebrate world peace, but go to sleep. If you use all your high tension and adrenaline to burn through your life force, you’ll die, you know." (Naofumi)<br/>
"Praise the compassion of the Hero of the Shield!"<br/>
"Yeah~!"<br/>
"They aren’t listening!" (Naofumi)<br/>
"Now, now, Naofumi-sama, everyone. Peace has finally come down on us after so long, and everyone is merely shaking with joy." (Raphtalia)<br/>
Raphtalia calms everyone down.<br/>
Well, I know what she wants to say, but…<br/>
"As expected of Naofumi-sama. Now then, Onii-sama, in the next three second, you will be taking a rest here. If you call yourself a warrior, you need to be able to sleep regardless of the location." (Atlas)<br/>
"A-Atlas."<br/>
Ah, Fohl looks seriously troubled.<br/>
It’s a difficult challenge for him to lie down here…<br/>
"Come on."<br/>
"Uu…"<br/>
He really did it! What an absolute madman!<br/>
"Zzzz…. Zzzz…"<br/>
Wow. Even under the eyes of this many people, he actually fell asleep.<br/>
I’m honestly impressed. This man will make it big some day!<br/>
"Ah, Fohl-niichan is amazing! I’ll also sleep!" (Kiel)<br/>
With some mysterious sense of competition, Kiel curls up by his side in puppy mode, and begins sleeping.<br/>
"Now it’s become quiet." (Atlas)<br/>
"Atlas-san…"<br/>
"As always, you’re quite the cruel person."<br/>
I can’t say I’m not impressed.<br/>
Even as a spirit, she messes with her brother.<br/>
Is this what the phrase, ‘even death can’t cure it’ is supposed to mean?<br/>
Even so, I think Fohl has fun having these talks with Atlas.<br/>
I mean, his sleeping face is really peaceful.<br/>
… He isn’t dead, right? Yeah, he’s not dead.<br/>
"Ara~ onee-san will take Fohl-chan and Kiel-chan to a bedroom in the castle. If there are any other sleepy children, please come with me~." (Sadina)<br/>
Sadina takes the initiative, and takes the two away in her arms.<br/>
I know she’s good at looking after people, but that was a smooth way to get out of this situation.<br/>
I also want to go with.<br/>
When I quietly try to follow behind Sadina, the guests, and Trash call out to stop me.<br/>
"Where do you think you’re going? Iwatani-dono, I think there’s something a little bit wrong with the Guest of Honor leaving his own banquet." (Trash)<br/>
I ran.<br/>
But I was surrounded by people.<br/>
Well, if I really wanted to get away, I could, but the situation isn’t that drastic.<br/>
"Ah, Melty! You! What are you doing, trying to escape with Firo!?"<br/>
She was casually following behind Sadina with Firo.<br/>
I won’t let you get away.<br/>
"Mel-chan, Firo wants to stay here." (Firo)<br/>
"There’s something bad happening over there. Now, let’s follow Sadina-san, and leave this place." (Melty)<br/>
"Eh…" (Firo)<br/>
"Hey… what’s up with the Queen of the largest country being the first to run away?" (Naofumi)<br/>
"Ara, Mother is back, so my role ends here. I want to be a princess again." (Melty)<br/>
She tries to get away by feigning amiability, but…<br/>
"Don’t worry, Melty. My body has already left the world. It is your era now, my daughter." (Queen)<br/>
"M-mother!?" (Melty)<br/>
"Because of my husband, I was barely able to remain in the world of the living, but I don’t know how long that will last. Melty, you are the Queen of the world." (Queen)<br/>
"N-no! I am…" (Melty)<br/>
"Hmm? I thought the Melty I knew was a child who would prioritize her duty. Is this Iwatani-sama’s influence?" (Queen)<br/>
"Uu…" (Melty)<br/>
"Melty, I’m happy that you grew up so freely. I’m sure a good time period is to come under you. You may be against it, but you will participate in this banquet." (Queen)<br/>
The soldiers grab the girl by the Shoulder, and drag her back.<br/>
"No! I still just want to be a normal girl!" (Melty)<br/>
Melty, what sort of Idol are you supposed to be?<br/>
Well, I guess Firo’s the idol here.<br/>
"Mel-chan, let’s play together!" (Firo)<br/>
Firo skipped after Melt as she was taken and confined to the guest of honor seat.<br/>
"Hah… I guess there’s nothing I can do." (Naofumi)<br/>
It doesn’t look like I’ll be able to get away from this.<br/>
I resigned myself, and participated in the banquet.<br/>
Thinking back, there was also a banquet when we overcame our first wave.<br/>
That was the worst, but now I’m acting as a representative, and the nobles offer their thanks to me.<br/>
As if they were special events, various happenings went on around.<br/>
"Eclaire!"<br/>
A fairly drunk Ren calls out to Female Knight.<br/>
What is this? No, I should quietly watch over the situation.<br/>
"What business do you have with me, Ren?" (Female Knight)<br/>
"There’s something I planned on saying once that battle came to an end." (Ren)<br/>
"Speak." (Female Knight)<br/>
"Please go out with me!" (Ren)<br/>
"… What?" (Female Knight)<br/>
He finally confessed!<br/>
Female Knight doesn’t seem to understand what’s going on. She stares in mute amazement.<br/>
"That straight-laced Hero of the Sword confessed."<br/>
"But I heard Eclaire became the Hero of the Katana, right? Don’t they fit well together?"<br/>
"What sort of result awaits us?"<br/>
The area is astir with gossip, and inquisitive eyes follow the two swordsmen.<br/>
"Eh, ah…"<br/>
Having finally understood the situation, Female Knight’s face turns bright red, and she starts walking away to escape.<br/>
"Wait! I want to hear your answer!" (Ren)<br/>
"S-shut ut! I-I-I have a mission!" (Female Knight)<br/>
"Please let me aid you in that mission!" (Ren)<br/>
"N-no. You have a duty to make the world peaceful!" (Female Knight)<br/>
"I know. Even the current situation is only us having crossed a large mountain. For the people, and for our comrades that have fallen, I will spend my days in atonement. And in that, Eclaire, I’d like to be with you." (Ren)<br/>
"Y-you’re not repenting at all! Your willpower, let me beat it into shape!" (Female Knight)<br/>
"Then… can I take that as a yes?" (Ren)<br/>
"Wha—no. I… to a young chick like you…" (Female Knight)<br/>
When she was about to speak up, her words got tied.<br/>
Yeah, the current Ren’s much more grown than the old one, and his body’s in good shape.<br/>
He’s evolved from a Bishounen Swordsman into a sturdy Biseinen Swordsman.<br/>
So calling him a young chick is a bit difficult.<br/>
What’s more, being a Hero who saved the world, the gazes of those around him are quite painful.<br/>
"You’re just drunk and messing around. I’ll be leaving!" (Female Knight)<br/>
"Please wait! These are my true feelings!" (Ren)<br/>
Female Knight ran away.<br/>
I mean, She ignores the eyes of the onlookers, and pushes through the crowd to get away from Ren.<br/>
"… Idiot."<br/>
(TL: Baka)<br/>
With a peevish expression on her face, Taniko leans on Gaelion and the former Catepilland Raph as she mumbles under her breath.<br/>
I get the feeling she was a much purer girl in the past…<br/>
"Why are you acting like this is someone else’s problem? It’s your fault that Wyndia’s become like this!"<br/>
Gaelion is glaring at me with all his might. Not my problem.<br/>
Well, she was set against getting revenge, but I put her up to fighting Ren anyways… perhaps she’s strayed from her path.<br/>
"Wyndia!"<br/>
Having had Female Knight run away from him, Ren starts walking towards Taniko.<br/>
His face is even redder than before. It seems he’s really drunk.<br/>
"Stay away." (Taniko)<br/>
"Gyau!" (Gaelion)<br/>
With killing intent coursing through every fiber of his body, Gaelion roars.<br/>
"Wyndia, I’ll definitely take responsibility!" (Ren)<br/>
"Wait, why are you saying a line like that in a place like this…" (Taniko)<br/>
The whispering voices get stronger.<br/>
Is Ren just really, REALLY drunk?<br/>
He’s acting without and honor like the old Motoyasu.<br/>
Well, the responsibility he’s talking about is probably just for hilling her father.<br/>
But I think a feminizing label’s being stuck on him by the people watching.<br/>
The second things didn’t go his way with Female Knight, he made an explosive announcement to Taniko.<br/>
"Wyndia! I’ll definitely make you happ–" (Ren)<br/>
"Don’t say any more than that! 「Lightning Dragon」!" (Taniko)<br/>
Ah… Taniko’s patience was at its end. What’s more, Gaelion even acted out.<br/>
Even while piss drunk, Ren takes up his sword, and repels the attacks focused on him.<br/>
How skilled.<br/>
"Hmm?" (Firo)<br/>
Firo started singing and dancing in a nice mood.<br/>
Behind her, Melty is reluctantly strumming her instrument.<br/>
No, to prevent the talks of her engagement to me from getting to the Queen, she’s probably putting on a performance.<br/>
"FUOOOOOH! Firo-tan’s song!"<br/>
And as always, Motoyasu loves Firo. He’s standing at the front, and cheering for her.<br/>
Behind him, his flock of three are glaring at him with unpleasant expressions. Is this some sort of trial for them?<br/>
"Kue~ Kue~"<br/>
Fitoria starts singing too.<br/>
No wait, is she the back chorus? It’s like a Capella was mixed in, raising the tension of the concert.<br/>
Where’s the Trash that’s supposed to be leading this?<br/>
I searched for him, and found him drinking wine on the terrace with the Queen.<br/>
That strange atmosphere around them prevents me from getting any closer.<br/>
Well, I still walk up to them anyways.<br/>
"Oh, Iwatani-dono. What seems to be the matter?" (Trash)<br/>
"The concert has become something amazing, so I’m here to tell you to go stop them." (Naofumi)<br/>
"This may sound rude on my part, but I would like everyone to enjoy themselves without restraint. I do not believe there to be a need to stop them." (Queen)<br/>
The Queen covers her mouth with her fan as she says this.<br/>
She really is a Vixen good with her mouth.<br/>
"Also, I think it would be much more effective if Iwatani-sama tried to stop them." (Queen)<br/>
"If I try doing that, they’ll just start cheering for me again." (Naofumi)<br/>
No matter what happens, I can’t stand people, or should I say large audience halls.<br/>
And from experience, I can only say it will heat up further if I get on stage.<br/>
"Isn’t that fine? Now, we are simply enjoying the lively noise. Luckily, there doesn’t appear to be any fighting breaking out." (Queen)<br/>
"No… there was." (Naofumi)<br/>
There’s Ren and Taniko’s fight.<br/>
The peanut gallery’s having fun, and it did feel like everyone was grasping for peace, though.<br/>
Outside the castle… no, more like all around the world, joy surges up.<br/>
… I distanced myself from that idiot couple, and found Itsuki.<br/>
He was also snuggled close to Rishia, and talking.<br/>
Once he spotted me, Itsuki called out.<br/>
"What’s wrong, Naofumi-san? Everyone will be sad if the guest of honor mopes around in a place like this." (Itsuki)<br/>
"Even if I’m not there, everyone will party." (Naofumi)<br/>
"But I think they’ll have even more fun if you’re there." (Itsuki)<br/>
"Yes, I also think that." (Rishia)<br/>
"Yeah, yeah. And? What are you guys doing here?" (Naofumi)<br/>
"Us? We’re leisurely enjoying the banquet as we plan for what’s to come." (Itsuki)<br/>
"Despite that, you’re letting out quite a sweet atmosphere, you know." (Naofumi)<br/>
"Fue!?" (Rishia)<br/>
Let me harass them a bit for letting their duty slide.<br/>
Even when they’re important guests too, they passed all of their responsibilities onto me, and are enjoying their time here. I’ll curse them.<br/>
"Yes. I’m quite aware I was creating a sweet atmosphere with Rishia-san." (Itsuki)<br/>
"FUEEEEEE!?" (Rishia)<br/>
Rishia raises her voice even louder, as her face turns red.<br/>
"I-Itsuki?" (Naofumi)<br/>
"It may sound very selfish. But I wish to answer to Rishia-san’s good will. I am a sinner. But… if I cannot make a single woman happy, I do not believe I will be able to save anyone. Especially if it’s someone as sinless as her." (Itsuki)<br/>
"Itsuki-sama… No matter what happens, I will not stray from your side." (Rishia)<br/>
"Rishia-san…" (Itsuki)<br/>
And a dimension for only the two of them was created.<br/>
Ah, just go flirt however you want.<br/>
If you just take on my harassment like that, I’m the one who ends up looking stupid.<br/>
"It seems really peaceful over here, Naofumi-san. Can I have a word with you?"<br/>
"Yeah."<br/>
And there, Glass appeared. She saves me from the pink dimension surrounding Itsuki and Rishia.<br/>
"I’m saved. I felt like I was becoming one with the background, bit I was unsure of what countermeasures to take." (Naofumi)<br/>
If Raphtalia was there, then perhaps I could have run, but right now, she’s at my seat, conversing with the nobles in place of me.<br/>
I’ll have to swap out with her later.<br/>
Atlas is in the middle of getting a lecture from Sadina for teasing Fohl.<br/>
Well, I doubt it’ll have any effect on her, though.<br/>
Raph-chan is singing along with Firo.<br/>
Ah, he changed to child Raphtalia form.<br/>
And the real one got mad.<br/>
"And? How is it? The feeling of a world at peace." (Naofumi)<br/>
"… I guess I’m to find that out from here on. I’m sure that from here on, the people of my world and yours will start clashing with one another." (Glass)<br/>
And so, she’s not participating in the festivities.<br/>
It’s not like I don’t get her.<br/>
"If it’s about that, it’s not like I can’t do anything." (Naofumi)<br/>
"Do you have something special planned?" (Glass)<br/>
"There’s a way to separate the worlds sticking together. As long as the worlds remain divided, you won’t have to deal with unnecessary clashes, right?" (Naofumi)<br/>
"Is that… what you called the power of God?" (Glass)<br/>
"Yeah, I can’t do it, but Raphtalia is able to. Though your sacred weapons will have to be enshrined away somewhere." (Naofumi)<br/>
If they do that, a god wouldn’t be able to get in. He wouldn’t have the chance to.<br/>
Well, I have a barrier over this world, I’ll erect one over the divided world as well. I’m sure that they’ll be able to form a peaceful place there.<br/>
"Is that… so?" (Glass)<br/>
"So what do you want to do, Glass?" (Naofumi)<br/>
"… I do not know. There are definitely conflicts, but I think overcoming them and reconciling is also an important part of life." (Glass)<br/>
"That’s right, there may be those around here that do not wish to accept others. Perhaps there will be persecution as well." (Naofumi)<br/>
"Then… will true peace ever come?" (Glass)<br/>
"No idea. This is what we find at the end of this strange world assimilation. There is fighting within those of the same race as well." (Naofumi)<br/>
My world’s a good example.<br/>
In the end, living things live through conflicts with others.<br/>
Even if there’s nothing but humans, there’s still people grasping for supremacy, and wars as a result.<br/>
You can’t call a single race world a peaceful one.<br/>
"This is quite difficult." (Glass)<br/>
"That’s right. By the way, Glass, you won’t celebrate with your own comrades?" (Naofumi)<br/>
I remember seeing them drinking to their victory a while age.<br/>
But Glass is here talking with me.<br/>
"Yes, I was enjoying the banquet up until a little while ago. But after calming down a bit, all of my tension was put on brakes." (Glass)<br/>
"Calming down…" (Naofumi)<br/>
"… I used to have a very important friend. And in a certain incident, they went missing. Without that person here, I wonder if it is alright for me to have fun by myself." (Glass)<br/>
"Friend? Someone you liked?" (Naofumi)<br/>
"While we are close as friends, that person is a woman." (Glass)<br/>
"Ah, I see." (Naofumi)<br/>
"Now, where is that person, and what are they doing…" (Glass)<br/>
"Are you sure they aren’t dead? Do you want me to search for them?" (Naofumi)<br/>
"That’s right. Having Naofumi-san find her is another option. But she said she would definitely return one day, so I’ll wait here, and protect the world for her." (Glass)<br/>
With the world in a pinch, there was a missing person…<br/>
Glass is also something for waiting for her.<br/>
I’ll try searching with God’s power.<br/>
I found a strange point in Glass’s past, and couldn’t find that friend of hers in her memory.<br/>
Was she an otherworlder?<br/>
I don’t think she’s dead, but It’ll be difficult to find her even for me.<br/>
IF I exerted myself, it would be possible, but with Glass herself like this…<br/>
"My fight has yet to end." (Glass)<br/>
"Make sure you don’t collapse somewhere." (Naofumi)<br/>
"I know." (Glass)<br/>
And for a while, I quietly watched the night sky with her on the terrace.<br/>
When I heard the audience getting loud again, I checked back to find the Old Man, Imya’s Uncle, and Imya carving an ice sculpture.<br/>
It seems they had the castle’s magicians cast ice magic to make a block of ice, and started ckiping pieces off of it.<br/>
"Oh, if it isn’t the laddie." (Old Man)<br/>
"What are you up to, Old Man? And wait, you were attending the castle’s banquet?" (Naofumi)<br/>
"They asked me to put on some sort of show, and I had just gotten here. I wanted to congratulate you for the battle, so watch here." (Old Man)<br/>
Working skillfully with a hammer, the Old Man finishes the sculpture.<br/>
A life-sized Firo is carved, and I seriously think the skill put into it is amazing… but isn’t something wrong with this picture?<br/>
What’s more, it’s a human form bird form set.<br/>
"If you have any requests, just say it. It doesn’t have to be ice." (Old Man)<br/>
"Fumu…" (Naofumi)<br/>
"Then I would like to place a request on your arms."<br/>
For some reason, Trash crossed the sea of people, and made an order.<br/>
"I would like a large statue singing praise of Iwatani-dono’s exploits. Of course, after these festivities are over. And make it grand." (Trash)<br/>
"What are you saying, old geezer?" (Naofumi)<br/>
"I was only talking about the realm of parlor tricks, but I got it. How large do you estimate it to be?" (Old Man)<br/>
"Fumu, from far away… Please construct a statue large enough that it can be seen in Melromark from afar." (Trash)<br/>
"Oh!? A statue of Father-in-Law!? There was one in a country of my world too. A Statue of a Goddess who sang of freedom!" (Motoyasu)<br/>
"The goddess portion sounds ominous, but if it’s Naofumi-dono, then I can assure the people will revere and extol his form for many years to come." (Trash)<br/>
"STOOOOOOPPPPP!" (Naofumi)<br/>
Why do they have to make something as disgusting as that?<br/>
Trash;s thought are leaping too fast, and I feel sick!<br/>
And Motoyasu, don’t hop on board!<br/>
What sort of sad reasons do you have to coerce the Old Man into making a giant statue of me?<br/>
Let’s try to calm them down, and foil their construction plans.<br/>
"You’ve been promoted quite a bit, laddie." (Old Man)<br/>
"Please quit it with the jokes." (Naofumi)<br/>
"Haha, the fact that it’s become peaceful will mean my shop will finally get quieter." (Old Man)<br/>
"… Did I do something bad?" (Naofumi)<br/>
Weapon shops generally rake in profit when there’s a feared enemy to combat.<br/>
In the age to come, there will still be monsters to fight, but I doubt there will be a time more profitable than during the waves.<br/>
"Don’t mind it. Peace is to be enjoyed in itself. And it’s not like I only sell weapons, you know." (Old Man)<br/>
I think… I heard that Imya’s Uncle ran a metallurgy shop in the past.<br/>
In a peaceful shop, perhaps a weapon store becomes something like that.<br/>
He did build Firo’s carriage, and I think he can do business as a utility man with metal.<br/>
"This is all because of you, laddie. I guess that means there was meaning in me trying hard for ya. And for a while, my shop’s going to be stable." (Old Man)<br/>
The Old Man winks, and points behind him.<br/>
"As expected of the store the Hero of the Shield-sama frequents! Please make equipment for me!"<br/>
"No, that will be my—"<br/>
Various requests started flooding in, and the nobles and representatives of other countries began whispering amongst themselves.<br/>
Well, the bulk of the armor I’m currently wearing was made by his store.<br/>
Its abilities were so high, it was surprising.<br/>
After that we had a simple conversation with a few jokes mixed in.<br/>
Motoyasu demanded that the Firo Statue be preserved for eternity, and he made the impossible request to Marin. In the end, with the Old Man’s permission, Kuu melted the whole thing down.<br/>
"Old Man-san, thank you for all you’ve done up until now." (Raphtalia)<br/>
Raphtalia comes over, and extends her thanks to the Old Man.<br/>
"Oh, if it isn’t the young lass! Haven’t you grown up nicely? It makes the first time I met you seem like a lie." (Old Man)<br/>
Thinking back, it was quite a long road…<br/>
I was framed by Witch, bought the Slave Raphtalia, bought weapons from the Old Man… a lot happened.<br/>
"Now, now, Ladies and gentlemen, gather round. It’s the monster acrobatic show. Yes."<br/>
Ah, the Slave Dealer I haven’t seen in a while is using his monsters to put on something like a circus show.<br/>
A large tiger-like monster jumps through a ring of fire, and a mysterious monster called an Egugu rode a bicycle. The scene tells me that there are some monsters who know not the world has been saved.<br/>
Taniko is watching the show in anticipation.<br/>
Out of curiosity, she keeps asking the Slave Dealer what monsters will come out.<br/>
I understand that she likes monsters, but the person she’s talking to uses slaves, and works monsters to the bone. He’s a terrible person, you know.<br/>
What’s more, they started some incomprehensible rivalry, and Taniko took the monsters from my land up on stage to do a performance.<br/>
Those that were modified into Raphs, and the Filo Rials. Gaelion’s tricks also sent the audience into high spirits.<br/>
Ah, I found Motoyasu’s former tag-along Elena.<br/>
She’s making a really sullen face as she converses with her parents.<br/>
"… Ah."<br/>
"It’s been a while." (Naofumi)<br/>
"No, it hasn’t been that long. I mean, I was on the battlefield." (Elena)<br/>
"You were there?" (Naofumi)<br/>
"Of course I was. My parents wouldn’t stop bitching at me." (Elena)<br/>
I think her father or something was some sort of military personnel in Melromark or something like that.<br/>
"I tried not to stand out, so perhaps you didn’t notice me, though." (Elena)<br/>
"Ah, I see." (Naofumi)<br/>
"For the executed former princess to be a world invading deity… she should have made Given up at some point. A foolish woman." (Elena)<br/>
"Hey…" (Naofumi)<br/>
The woman who calmly indulged in depravity said it with a level tone.<br/>
I think that if she had that much power, she could live life however she wanted. She could have indulged in as much luxury as she wanted.<br/>
But I guess if you keep looking up, there’s no end in sight.<br/>
"Well, I guess you worked hard. Good job." (Elena)<br/>
"I don’t feel happy at all when I hear it from you." (Naofumi)<br/>
"I guess so… Ah, this is a pain. I’ll have to set up shop in the Hero of the Shield’s land soon, and my parents keep bitching on about profitability. Even when I just want to relax, why is life so hard?"<br/>
"That’s your fault! Just be thankful you haven’t been executed yet." (Naofumi)<br/>
She really just spits out as much abusive language as she wants.<br/>
As a form of punishment, I’ll give her shop some special privileges.<br/>
At the entrance to the hall is a sturdy merchant selling accessories with all of his commercial spitit. To clarify, the one who owns a department store in Zeltburg.<br/>
There’s also the swindler, who’s become something of a millionaire. He’s formed an alliance with the accessory merchant to take control of the money of those partying in the Castle Town. But that’s a story for later.<br/>
I’m sure my land will continue to develop.<br/>
"Naofumi-cha~n!"<br/>
A drunk Sadina grabs me from behind.<br/>
"Whatcha doing? If you’re bored, how about entertaining everyone with this onee-san?" (Sadina)<br/>
Having finished Atlas’s lecture, it appears Sadina started a drinking competition, and one thing led to another.<br/>
"And so Naofumi-chan will be participating~! Everyone, let’s have a contest between this Onee-san and Naofumi-chan~." (Sadina)<br/>
"Okay, everyone! The Hero of the Shield, and the Hero of the Harpoon are going at it!"<br/>
"Hey! Sadina, stop!" (Naofumi)<br/>
"Ahn, I love you, Naofumi-chan~." (Sadina)<br/>
Sadina starts leaning on me.<br/>
"Hey, Raphtalia-chan, hurry and do fun things with Naofumi-chan. Then next is Atlas-chan’s turn, and then I’m up." (Sadina)<br/>
"Ahaha…"<br/>
Raphtalia wipes away some sweat.<br/>
Just how serious is she, this woman?<br/>
"If you don’t hurry up, I might just end up eating him up." (Sadina)<br/>
"Who’s getting eaten!? Hey, don’t bring your face so close! You stink of alcohol!" (Naofumi)<br/>
"No, I am Naofumi-sama’s number one!" (Atlas)<br/>
Atlas makes a dramatic appearance.<br/>
"Rafu~!"<br/>
"Ah, Master’s looks like he’s having fun. Let Firo and Mel-chan in~! Now, Mel-chan, let’s–" (Firo)<br/>
"I-I don’t want…" (Melty)<br/>
Melty and Firo approach us.<br/>
If you don’t want to come, then run away.<br/>
The villagers, and our other comrades also gather.<br/>
"P-please stop it! Naofumi-sama is with me!" (Raphtalia)<br/>
Good grief, there’s no end to this cacophony.<br/>
Like that, the banquet dragged on for a while.<br/>
Once I got worn out, I left and took a rest in a guest room before returning, only to be congratulated once more.<br/>
In the end, the banquet doors remained open for an entire week, but I guess that doesn’t really matter.<br/>
