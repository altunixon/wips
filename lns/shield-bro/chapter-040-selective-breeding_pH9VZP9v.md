Chapter 40 <br/>
 <br/>
Selective Breeding <br/>
 <br/>
Raphtalia: "Something like this?" <br/>
Naofumi: "Yea, we should contact the village after this" <br/>
 <br/>
Seed of Miracles... We who subjugated the Bio Plant, which was Motoyasu's failure, are currently collecting seeds. <br/>
I let my shield absorb any seeds that it reacted to. <br/>
 <br/>
Requirements for Bio Plant Shield have been revealed. <br/>
Requirements for Plantriwe Shield have been revealed. <br/>
Requirements for Mandoragora Shield have been revealed. <br/>
 <br/>
Bio Plant Shield <br/>
Unsealing completed... Equipment Bonus: Plant Remodelling <br/>
Special Effect: Hook <br/>
 <br/>
Plantriwe Shield <br/>
Unsealing completed... Equipment Bonus: Intermediate Compounding 2 <br/>
 <br/>
Mandoragora Shield <br/>
Unsealing completed... Equipment Bonus: Plant Analysis <br/>
 <br/>
I've unlocked the plant skill tree for my shield. Although it's been unlocked, it still seems insufficient. <br/>
 <br/>
Naofumi: "Plant Remodelling?" <br/>
 <br/>
I switched to the Bio Plant Shield and test out what plant remodelling does. <br/>
An icon appeared over the seed that I look at. <br/>
I fed some magic to the seed of a Bio Plant that I picked up earlier. <br/>
The seed floats in the air. <br/>
 <br/>
Fertility 9 <br/>
Productivity 9 <br/>
Vitality 9 <br/>
Immunity 4 <br/>
Intelligence 1 <br/>
Growth Potential 9 <br/>
Variability 9 <br/>
Special Ability <br/>
 <br/>
What is that? <br/>
First of all, I'll lower everything. <br/>
The window makes a beeping sound as the values decrease. <br/>
All other statuses were decreased while increasing one. <br/>
 <br/>
Fertility 1 <br/>
Productivity 1 <br/>
Vitality 1 <br/>
Immunity 1 <br/>
Intelligence 1 <br/>
Growth Potential 43 <br/>
Variability 1 <br/>
Special Ability <br/>
 <br/>
Hmm... I don't understand. <br/>
Well, all it has is growth powers, is that even good? <br/>
Oh, my MP decreases when I use this skill, it's almost empty. <br/>
 <br/>
Raphtalia: "Naofumi-sama?" <br/>
 <br/>
The modified Bio Plant seed that I made was dropped by accident. <br/>
 <br/>
"Oo!" <br/>
 <br/>
The ground immediately becomes lush and green <br/>
But... <br/>
 <br/>
"What?" <br/>
 <br/>
It grew in abundance for about 3 meters and then withered instantly. <br/>
 <br/>
Raphtalia: "What are you doing?" <br/>
Naofumi: "Ah, I’m experimenting with Plant remodelling using that seed" <br/>
Raphtalia: "Please don't do something so dangerous!" <br/>
 <br/>
I was scolded by Raphtalia. <br/>
Well, if it was someone else who did that, I would be angry too. <br/>
But, this skill is really interesting. <br/>
It seems I'll be able to make huge profits if I utilize it correctly. <br/>
 <br/>
Raphtalia: "Naofumi-sama, your smile looks rotten" <br/>
 <br/>
Oops, did it show on my face? <br/>
 <br/>
Naofumi: "Anyway, let's return to the village" <br/>
Raphtalia: "Yeah" <br/>
 <br/>
We were greeted by silence as we walked out of the brown plant zone. <br/>
 <br/>
Villager: "Thank you Hero-sama" <br/>
 <br/>
Humans work for profit. <br/>
After I save the village I am welcomed gratefully. <br/>
Well, it would be impossible to live in the village with all those dead plants. <br/>
That day, we ended up cleaning all the withered plants. <br/>
Even if the main body is destroyed, the fruit and potatoes remain, It seems there won't be a food shortage for a while. <br/>
But I'm a little worried about the soil. <br/>
 <br/>
Naofumi: "Aren't you going to return to a famine?" <br/>
Villager: "Well...... that's very likely" <br/>
 <br/>
In the near future, this village might be deserted. <br/>
After thinking it through, I push forward my plant remodelling plan. <br/>
I don't understand what special ability is yet. <br/>
 <br/>
By looking at a seed, the plant analysis menu pops up. <br/>
I equip the Mandoragora shield and go to bed. <br/>
The next morning, I change to the Bio Plant shield and continue remodelling. <br/>
 <br/>
Fertility 9 <br/>
Productivity 9 <br/>
Vitality 9 <br/>
Immunity 4 <br/>
Intelligence 1 <br/>
Growth Potential 9 <br/>
Variability 9 <br/>
Special Ability <br/>
Upon death a seed is produced. <br/>
Mutation Range Expansion. <br/>
 <br/>
I see... This was the original ability of the Bio Plants. <br/>
Originally, it was made with the purpose of producing food, but due to its mutation ability, it became a demon. <br/>
It might not be a bad idea to nip the problem at its root. <br/>
Due to its low immunity the herbicide is effective. <br/>
 <br/>
I check the special ability. Various items appeared. <br/>
There are special instructions next to each item. <br/>
It seems I can choose abilities by sacrificing stats. <br/>
This village is troubled by the second coming of the famine. <br/>
That's why I'll experiment. <br/>
 <br/>
 <br/>
Fertility 4 is simply the power to increase. We don't need too much so I'll lower it. <br/>
 <br/>
Productivity 15 should be the ability that produced fruit. To combat the famine I'll increase it.  <br/>
 <br/>
Vitality 6 is this the power to grow anywhere? Let's drop it a little. <br/>
 <br/>
Immunity 4 is the power to resist sickness. Because the herbicide is effective I'll leave it alone. <br/>
 <br/>
Intelligence 1 What the heck is this, does it give it a demon's intelligence? I don't know what increasing it might do. <br/>
 <br/>
Growth Potential 15 the speed at which it grows. Let's increase this. <br/>
 <br/>
Variability 1 this is probably the cause of plants becoming demons. <br/>
 <br/>
Special Ability, I add in an ability that increases quality of crops and cancel the Mutation ability. <br/>
Upon death a higher quality seed is produced. <br/>
 <br/>
Naofumi: "It's completed" <br/>
Raphtalia: "Is something wrong?" <br/>
 <br/>
Raphtalia stirs and asks me sleepily. <br/>
The villagers suggested that the saint, and holy bird stay overnight in the village. <br/>
 <br/>
The fruits and potatoes of the Bio Plant are quite delicious. <br/>
It's an annoying plant, but it tastes good. <br/>
If my remodelling succeeds, it will become the special product of the village. <br/>
 <br/>
Naofumi: "Ah, continuing from yesterday is a bit..." <br/>
Raphtalia: “You’re still at it?" <br/>
Naofumi: "It's a little bad to leave things as is right?" <br/>
 <br/>
The famine will hit sooner or later. Therefore, I'll stop it by all means. <br/>
Even if I can go shopping from different areas, it's impossible for this amount of people. <br/>
It would be difficult for these inhabitants who have lived here a long time to move. <br/>
 <br/>
Naofumi: "Now then" <br/>
 <br/>
I got off the carriage and dropped the seed onto the withered ground slowly. <br/>
The plant grows and covers a corner of the former village site. <br/>
 <br/>
Villager: "Wh-What's happening?" <br/>
 <br/>
The people who were resting near the camp run up to get a closer look. <br/>
 <br/>
Naofumi: "Ah my bad, it's just a little experiment." <br/>
Villager: "What are you doing?" <br/>
 <br/>
The villagers seem to be scared of the plants. <br/>
 <br/>
Naofumi: "Experiments to change this into a safe plant..." <br/>
 <br/>
Due to its low fertility, the plant stops growing. <br/>
And...... <br/>
Red and young fruit similar to a tomato appears. It seems the foundation for the plant is a tomato. <br/>
 <br/>
Naofumi: "I think that's a success" <br/>
Villager: "Yea…" <br/>
Naofumi: "Whether or not you want to use it is up to you. Whether this was in vain or be an asset is in your hands." <br/>
 <br/>
It seems the mutation range expansion and the variability status doesn't only change into demons, it also has the effect of producing various fruits and other plants. <br/>
I sprinkled some herbicide to wither the plant. I hand the seed over to the feudal lord there. <br/>
 <br/>
Naofumi: "Well them, we'll be on our way, bye-bye." <br/>
 <br/>
Firo who was already awake and stuffing herself with tomatoes prepares to pull the carriage. <br/>
 <br/>
Villager: "Please wait!" <br/>
Naofumi: "Hm? What’s up?" <br/>
Villager: "We still haven't rewarded you yet. How abo-" <br/>
 <br/>
Naofumi: "Are you fellows having difficulty with stock processing, and going to push the problem on me?" <br/>
Villager: "Uh-uhm how about....." <br/>
 <br/>
My carriage has now become 4 vehicles. <br/>
3 of the carts were loaded with crops that came from the Bio Plant. <br/>
It seems they were gifts along with the carts. <br/>
I reluctantly received it because they presented it with a smile. <br/>
After connecting the carts, Firo pulls the carriage happily. <br/>
 <br/>
Firo: "It's heavy and comfortable~!" <br/>
 <br/>
As expected of a demon changed from a Philorial <br/>
The journey continues while the carriage shakes. <br/>
 <br/>
Additionally, after I realised the herbicide could be used as a weapon. I went to play with treants. <br/>
It seems to be effective only on plants which have a parasitic ability. <br/>
I don't understand its standards. <br/>
Perhaps there are no traces of any demons in the Bio Plant, it might be just a simple plant. <br/>
 <br/>
Well, it's fine. With Raphtalia and Firo, I don't have to worry about being attacked. <br/>
Let’s think of a way to use the food that cannot be eaten first. <br/>
That reminds me... I heard a rumour about a famine up north. I should go sell there. <br/>
 <br/>
Naofumi: "Let's depart for the north." <br/>
Firo: "Okay~!"
<br/>
