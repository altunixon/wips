The Benadryl and Hydrocortisone worked! Also chapter here.<br/>
My finger is nearly back to normal (though a bit darker and wrinkly/flabby excess skin :(|).<br/>
I’ll start on chapter 10, but I probably wont finish it today. I get bored easily. It is a wonder that I didn’t get sidetracked and completely forget I was even translating. I was uninstalling Visual Studio because it broke, and everything related to it so I could do a fresh install, and got distracted midway (I used Absolute Uninstall to mass uninstall the leftover SQL and IIS stuff).<br/>
Chapter 10 seems to have pretty short sentences, so it should take about as long as this one (3h?).<br/>
