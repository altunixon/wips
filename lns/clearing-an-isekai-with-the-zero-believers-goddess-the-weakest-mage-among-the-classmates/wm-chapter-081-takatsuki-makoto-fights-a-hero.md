<br/>
"What is the Trash Hero of the Water Country doing here? Huuuh?" <br/>
I thought that was directed at me, but it looks like that wasn’t the case.<br/>
The one who was standing there was a knight with golden armor and sharp eyes. <br/>
Golden hair and ultramarine eyes.<br/>
Judging from the luxurious decorations of his armor, he is most likely a person of pretty high standing.<br/>
And…has quite the terrible personality.<br/>
Or more like, he smells like trouble.<br/>
"Oi oi oi oi, don’t just shut up and say something. Oi, you damn brat." <br/>
This is one guy with a lot of Ois.<br/>
"Prince Leonard, who is him?" (Makoto)<br/>
I ask Prince Leonard who is facing down.<br/>
"…The Sun Country’s Lightning Hero, Geralt-dono." (Leonard)<br/>
"Huuh? That’s Geralt-sama for ya! A Hero of a mere weakling country, I hope you are not thinking that we are on the same level." (Geralt)<br/>
What’s with this countryside hoodlum kind of Hero?<br/>
Different from Sakurai-kun and Prince Leonard, doesn’t he lack way too much class?<br/>
"Is there any need to say that much?" (Makoto)<br/>
For now, I try to mediate this.<br/>
The Lightning Hero looked at me as if a piece of trash just spoke.<br/>
"What’s with you? Trash doesn’t speak." (Geralt)<br/>
He said it out loud!<br/>
"Takatsuki-kun is the Hero of the Water Country!" (Lucy)<br/>
"He defeated a Taboo Monster, I’ll have you know!" (Aya)<br/>
Sa-san and Lucy introduced me in my stead.<br/>
It was hard for me to say it myself that ‘I am a Hero’, so this is fine.<br/>
"Hero…Takatsuki…" (Geralt)<br/>
The expression of the man turned dangerous.<br/>
"You, are you a Hero that came from the other world?" (Geralt)<br/>
"I am a Hero that was assigned just recently though." (Makoto)<br/>
I gave a safe answer.<br/>
"Lend me yer face." (Geralt)<br/>
Are you a delinquent?! <br/>
Well, his looks and way of speaking are the very definition of a delinquent though.<br/>
…He really is a Hero, right?<br/>
"What is it?" (Makoto)<br/>
The man didn’t answer that and simply threw a wooden sword in front of me.<br/>
"Let’s have a match. Don’t worry, I will hold back." (Geralt)<br/>
He grins with a sadistic smile.<br/>
Yeah, I only have a bad feeling about this.<br/>
"Makoto-san, you must not! His hobby is to bring pain to the people that don’t agree with him, and this is his way of doing it!!" (Leonard)<br/>
Prince Leonard shouts.<br/>
Well, I figured that was the case.<br/>
"Shut up, Trash. When I was your age, I already hunted more than a hundred monsters and dragons. Even though Taboo Monsters appeared in a dungeon in your own country, you were holed up in your house and trembling. That kind of trash should stay out of this." (Geralt)<br/>
"Kuh…!" (Leonard)<br/>
Prince Leonard trembled in mortification.<br/>
I see.<br/>
I thought Prince Leonard not going to dungeons was normal because he is a child, but in the Sun Country, a Hero of 9 years old is made to work too, huh.<br/>
Are there working standard laws in this country? I don’t think so.<br/>
 "Oi, what will you do? Heroes are the symbol of that country’s power. Don’t tell me you are going to refuse." (Geralt)<br/>
The Lightning Hero provokes me.<br/>
"I am also fine with fighting that prostitute-looking mage or that flatboard chest of a brawler. Or more like, aren’t those girls at your back stronger than you who’s a Hero?" (Geralt)<br/>
What, you bastard!<br/>
Well, he is right.<br/>
The two at my back are stronger.<br/>
But it pisses me off that he is talking like that about my comrades.<br/>
"Takatsuki-kun, it is okay. I will fight him in your stead." (Aya)<br/>
Sa-san must have been angered by that, she was motivated.<br/>
"Hey, I can drop a Meteor on this guy, right?" (Lucy)<br/>
Even Lucy! Ah, she is actually more hot-headed than Sa-san.<br/>
"Now now, wait a bit. I just have to fight you, right?" (Makoto)<br/>
"Yeah, that’s what I’ve been saying from the beginning, you dullard. Come at me already. Go ahead." (Geralt)<br/>
I wonder why. Even though we are supposed to be standing at the capital that’s the top of the top of this continent…isn’t the cultural standard low?<br/>
Ah, he is a Hero and a noble, huh.<br/>
Isn’t the standard of nobles low?<br/>
"Makoto-san…I am sorry. Because of me…" (Leonard)<br/>
"What are you saying? He is the crazy one." (Makoto)<br/>
"He was…originally the representative Hero of the Sun Country. But since the time his standing was taken away by the Light Hero Sakurai-san, he has been acting like this. Makoto-san, please don’t push yourself…" (Leonard)<br/>
"Aah…I see…" (Makoto)<br/>
So one of the people that was passed by Sakurai-kun, huh.<br/>
Pitiful.<br/>
But it is pathetic to vent it out on this small child.<br/>
The Lightning Hero is standing at the center of the training field and waiting with arms crossed.<br/>
…There’s no need to do it at the very center though…<br/>
The surrounding soldiers are going ‘what what?’ and were paying attention over here.<br/>
Maan.<br/>
I slowly head there.<br/>
I honestly want to go back.<br/>
"Lightning Hero, Geralt Valentine." (Geralt)<br/>
The man introduced himself while taking a stance with the wooden sword.<br/>
Geh, Valentine, isn’t that one of noble households that I must not go against?<br/>
One of the Five Sacred Nobles of the Sun Country.<br/>
I heard that their status is on the same level as other royalty aside from the Sun Country…<br/>
The reason why he was so easily being rude to Prince Leonard was because of this, huh…<br/>
What a troublesome man to have the attention of.<br/>
"Uhm, Water Country’s Hero, Takatsuki Makoto…" (Makoto)<br/>
Introducing yourself is the etiquette here, right? Probably.<br/>
I don’t use swords, so I borrowed a staff that was around the place.<br/>
"A mage, huh… With that kind of trash-like mana, I am surprised you are calling yourself a Hero." (Geralt)<br/>
He says mockingly.<br/>
Since a while now, he has been saying stuff like Sa-san and Lucy being stronger.<br/>
Does he have an Appraisal Skill that lets him know that I have a low amount of mana?<br/>
"Hey, I am coming!" (Geralt)<br/>
Without even a signal to begin, he suddenly charged forward.<br/>
H-He disappeared?! <br/>
[Evade]!<br/>
I avoid the attack of Geralt by a hair’s breadth.<br/>
A wind cutting sound that sends chills into my ears passes by.<br/>
T-This guy…is he saying this is him holding back?<br/>
"What’s with that turtle-like way of evading?!" (Geralt)<br/>
"Gahack!" (Makoto)<br/>
A powerful shock runs around my shoulder. I was kicked?!<br/>
He aimed for the slight moment of stiffness that comes after using the Evade Skill.<br/>
"Here! It is over!" (Geralt)<br/>
He was about to continue his attack, but…<br/>
(Water Magic: [Water Needle].) (Makoto)<br/>
"Tch!" (Geralt)<br/>
One of my trump cards, the chantless blinding magic was easily avoided.<br/>
Sa-san also avoided it in the past, so it doesn’t work on people with a certain level difference, huh.<br/>
"Doing trash-like attacks." (Geralt)<br/>
Damn it! I can’t see most of his attacks.<br/>
For now, I should concentrate on evading the sword attacks only, and take all other damages.<br/>
"Guh!" (Makoto)<br/>
He once again aimed at the time after I used Evade.<br/>
This time I was kicked on my back.<br/>
[Evade]! [Evade]! [Evade]! <br/>
"What a pain! Just fall to the ground and beg for mercy already! A trash-like Hero like you shouldn’t be calling himself a Hero!" (Geralt)<br/>
Saying whatever he wants!<br/>
I am supposed to be avoiding his attacks with Evade, but my wounds are increasing.<br/>
Even though it is a wooden sword, it feels as sharp as if I had been cut by metal.<br/>
So this is what happens when you wrap it in Aura, huh…<br/>
"Oi oi, it will end with just a sword, you know. At least make it so that I have to use my Sword Magic Skills." (Geralt)<br/>
This bastard.<br/>
(Water Magic: [Mist].) (Water Magic: [Ice Needle])<br/>
I use mist to block his sight, and aim to blind him again.<br/>
"Annoying!" (Geralt)<br/>
The Hero shouts, creating a gale that blows away everything around.<br/>
That’s crazy! <br/>
"Ora!" (Geralt)<br/>
Gugh?!<br/>
"?!" <br/>
*BANG!*<br/>
I received an impact as if an explosion had occurred close to me, and was sent flying.<br/>
The inside of my mouth must have been cut, I could taste my blood.<br/>
I somehow manage to endure not letting all that was inside my stomach out.<br/>
If I get hit one more time, I feel like my consciousness is going to fly…<br/>
"Takatsuki-kun!" "Makoto!" "Makoto-san!" <br/>
Lucy, Sa-san, and Prince Leonard ran over to me.<br/>
"You, just give it a break already! Makoto is a mage, you know?!" (Lucy)<br/>
"It is okay, Lucy-san. I will be his opponent next." (Aya)<br/>
"Makoto-san… I will take him on as well." (Leonard)<br/>
Lucy and Sa-san suddenly raised their voices and got in between me and the Lightning Hero.<br/>
Prince Leonard is also in tears.<br/>
"Aaah, wait, just wait for a bit, you three. I am still okay." (Makoto)<br/>
Honestly speaking, my body is screaming…but I somehow manage to stand up with my body swaying.<br/>
"…You…must be an idiot." (Geralt)<br/>
The Lightning Hero says to me as if looking down on me from the bottom of his heart.<br/>
"Oi…isn’t this bad?" "Geralt-sama lynched a guy he didn’t like before…" "Isn’t he the Hero of the Water Country? It is gonna turn into a problem…" "Someone, call Princess Noel." "We already went to a long time ago."<br/>
I heard those voices around.<br/>
This guy is always doing stuff like this…?<br/>
What a hopeless guy.<br/>
"Oi, what’s the matter? Come at me, all at once. If I win, I will take those two women." (Geralt)<br/>
The Lightning Hero Geralt makes a dirty smile.<br/>
…Is this a Hero of the Sun Country?<br/>
"Women, I will treat you well in my bed. Be honored." (Geralt)<br/>
"Who would even with a piece of shit like you." "This guy is the worst." <br/>
Lucy and Sa-san insult him.<br/>
"The one who is going to fight is me alone." (Makoto)<br/>
I push Sa-san and Lucy aside, and walk forward.<br/>
"Don’t, Takatsuki-kun!" (Aya)<br/>
"Hey, let’s fight together, Makoto!" (Lucy)<br/>
"It is okay." (Makoto)<br/>
I smile at the two who were about to cry, and walk forward.<br/>
I’m no good.<br/>
Making my comrades have such faces…<br/>
Aaah, it honestly makes my stomach churn.<br/>
Even though I still have my Clear Mind at 50%…<br/>
"Takatsuki-kun! Are you okay?!" <br/>
"Hero Makoto!" <br/>
Someone came.<br/>
I endure the pain in my body and look at my back, and I see Sakurai-kun and Princess Sofia.<br/>
I am showing them such an unsightly figure.<br/>
"Stop at once!" <br/>
The severe expression of Princess Noel appears at a corner of my eye.<br/>
"…Noel, huh." (Geralt)<br/>
Geralt mutters bitterly.<br/>
"What are you doing? He is the Hero of the Water Country. Do you think something like this can be forgiven?!" (Noel)<br/>
"Shut up. Stay out of this!" (Geralt)<br/>
Oi oi, that’s impressive.<br/>
Princess Noel, the number one in succeeding the Sun Country. She is supposed to be the most influential person in the West Continent.<br/>
Is this way of speaking forgivable?<br/>
…No, more importantly.<br/>
"Princess Noel, this is a match that Geralt-sama and I agreed upon. Can you allow us to do this till the end?" (Makoto)<br/>
"Hero Makoto! What are you saying?!" (Sofia)<br/>
It is rare for Princess Sofia to raise her voice like that.<br/>
"Takatsuki-kun…" (Sakurai)<br/>
Sakurai-kun has an uneasy expression.<br/>
Sorry for worrying you here.<br/>
"Water Country’s Hero, Takatsuki-sama, if it gets dangerous, I will stop it." (Noel)<br/>
Princess Noel looks at me with serious eyes.<br/>
"…Yeah, that would help a lot." (Makoto)<br/>
I thank Princess Noel who is worried about me.<br/>
And then, I look back at the Lightning Hero who has his arms crossed.<br/>
"Lightning Hero, Geralt. I will be using a ‘certain’ magic from now on, so if you manage to avoid it, you win. How’s that?" (Makoto)<br/>
"Huh? That’s stupid. If you had something like that, use it already, Trash. If I win, I will cut off an arm of yours." (Geralt)<br/>
Geh, is he seriously saying that? <br/>
"I won’t let him do that. Please don’t worry." (Noel)<br/>
Princess Noel says.<br/>
I feel like the super sadist Hero in front of me would seriously cut off an arm though…<br/>
"Then, everyone, please move away." (Makoto)<br/>
"This is stupid. So damn stupid. Powerful magic takes time to activate. I’ll just have to cut you down before you can activate it." (Geralt)<br/>
The people around create a circle surrounding us.<br/>
…I would like them to get a bit further away though.<br/>
Well, that’s fine.<br/>
"Hey, do it already. With that trash-like mana of yours." (Geralt)<br/>
"Then, I will take you up on that offer." (Makoto)<br/>
I lower my Clear Mind to 0%.<br/>
"Die!" (Geralt)<br/>
Geralt closes the distance in an instant.<br/>
(Water Magic: [Water Dragon].) <br/>
Before his sword reaches me…a giant pillar of water gushes out with me at the center.<br/>
What was drawing a circle around me, the cluster of Water Dragons, were swimming around the training field.<br/>
(I called everyone.) (Let’s call for more.) (Are you hurt?) (Are you okay) (Did you get hurt by that guy?) (He annoys me.) (Let’s get him.) (I will help~.) (Hey, let’s play.) (Yaay.) (No, we are going to get that guy.) (Let’s call a whole lot more.) (Hey, is your arm okay?) (That looks painful.) (How pitiful.) (Unforgivable.) (Hey.) (Play with us.) (Call for more.) (A lot of friends came.) (See~.) (Yaay.) (Use magic quickly.) (Quick quick.) (Hey~.) (Come on~.) (Yaay.)<br/>
A big chorus of Spirits reach my ears.<br/>
Everyone is speaking freely.<br/>
I have been speaking to the Spirits all this time as I was fighting, and more and more Spirits have begun to come.<br/>
There’s already a whole ton of Blue Spirits flying around.<br/>
I borrow a little bit of that infinite mana of them.<br/>
With their mana, I continue shooting Superior Magic.<br/>
"So damn annoying!" (Geralt)<br/>
A light as if lightning struck occurred, and a big tornado roars with him at the center.<br/>
The Water Dragons can’t get close to him.<br/>
The Lightning Hero pushes forward while splitting aside the wave of Water Dragons.<br/>
He may be rotten, but he is still a Hero, huh.<br/>
Superior Magic won’t stop him then.<br/>
I said this to Geralt.<br/>
"Then, I will be using a big spell now." (Makoto)<br/>
"…Huh?" (Geralt)<br/>
While I looked at the Lightning Hero make a dubious expression for a second.<br/>
—Spirits get happier when you expose your emotions.<br/>
The words of Noah-sama resonate in me.<br/>
I let my anger sweep me, and use Spirit Magic.<br/>
