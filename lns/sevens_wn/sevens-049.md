TL: It seems this is my site’s first anniversary, and my own anniversary of taking up translating. Maybe I should just go buy a domain already. Ah, also, I’m struggling to innovatively translate the toxic maid’s insults. Maybe I need an englishman.<br/>
Prologue<br/>
Inside the Circry House’s estate in Arumsaas, I was eating my meal.<br/>
I usually eat Novem’s cooking, but only for today, a certain "Toxic Automaton" insisted she would do it, and she wouldn’t budge on the matter.<br/>
It seems she possesses a sense of rivalry against Novem, but it’s strange no matter how you look at it.<br/>
That scrap metal maid… the moment she came to the mansion, she directed an attack at the girl.<br/>
She had picked up the nearest broom, and tried to lower it on Novem’s head, but I stopped her…<br/>
"How is it? The taste of the food I put my all into making for a wimpy chicken dickwad?"<br/>
Chicken dickwad was likely referring to me.<br/>
It seems that since I didn’t have the high spirits of when we first met, she added a wimpy to it.<br/>
"No, it’s delicious. It’s much tastier than I imagined, but…"<br/>
"But? But what? A chicken dickwad has some complaints to voice against my cooking? Now out with it. Tomorrow, I’ll make use of those complaints to prepare the supreme dish."<br/>
I looked at the other dishes lining the table.<br/>
The presentation was perfect.<br/>
There was no problem with the taste. In fact, it was delicious.<br/>
The fact that an automaton could do this much was truly a truth I hadn’t imagined.<br/>
"… Isn’t there a gap between my plate and the others?"<br/>
Only I had a larger portion.<br/>
The scrap metal looked at me, and let out a scornful laugh.<br/>
"That, of all things? I prepared a greater portion of food for my master, the chicken dickwad. I did not exceed the sum of money I was permitted, so there shouldn’t be a problem?"<br/>
There was a problem.<br/>
"Hey, you see, this is Miranda-san’s mansion. We’re just freeloaders!"<br/>
Miranda-san, who was eating alongside us, spoke.<br/>
"Ah, you don’t have to worry about that. How about it. Why not just become the master here?"<br/>
The pale green haired Miranda-san looked at me with her emerald eyes.<br/>
Her mischievous intentions were blatently visible.<br/>
She was definitely having fun.<br/>
I thought she was a cat-like person, but following the events of our previous dungeon expedition, more of her personality was showing than before.<br/>
I looked towards Novem, with her brown side ponytail.<br/>
Novem didn’t seem to be noticing my glance.<br/>
And she took a bite…<br/>
"For Lyle-sama’s preferences, the taste is a little light."<br/>
And said that.<br/>
Hearing that, Aria let out a sigh.<br/>
The red-haired Aria directed her violet eyes at me.<br/>
"Make sure you don’t let them go too far."<br/>
The reason Aria felt fed up was because of this piece of junk.<br/>
I mean, this pile of scraps…<br/>
"Mu! So this is the rumored "Stepmother Bullying the Young Wife" entry in my data! Are you perhaps unsatisfied with my cooking? Considering nutritional balance, I have surely created the finest of tastes."<br/>
… Liked to compete with Novem.<br/>
I’m not even sure why, but only to Novem did she ever display an emotion like hostility.<br/>
Seeing the situation, from the blue Jewel hung at my neck came a voice only I could hear.<br/>
The Fourth Generation Head of the Walt House, "Max Walt" had his long blue hair parted in a seven to three ration at the front, and glasses hanging on his face.<br/>
Within the Jewel, everyone had manifest in a form somewhere around their thirties.<br/>
This Fourth’s notable characteristic was… not just his glasses.<br/>
"Good grief, what a strange automaton. For her to pick a fight with Novem-chan, just what could she be thinking… now stop them already, Lyle."<br/>
In regards to women, the Fourth was quite loud.<br/>
No, to be more specific, in regards to the treatment of women.<br/>
"Hah, scrap metal, isn’t that enough? Why are you always on at Novem?"<br/>
As the Fourth requested, I stopped the scrap metal.<br/>
But surprisingly, Novem…<br/>
"Lyle-sama, I think scrap metal is a little cruel. We’ve finally gotten ourselves a new comrade, so we’ll have to decide on a name."<br/>
What a nice girl…<br/>
In contrast.<br/>
"For you to show mercy to the enemy… that naivety will cost you your life one day. Even if I look like this, I was manufactured as a top of the line model, and I’ve even been praised as his greatest masterpiece. I can’t be receiving mercy from…"<br/>
As she started into some incomprehensible words, Miranda-san spoke.<br/>
"Then isn’t scrap metal good enough?"<br/>
"… Chicken dickwad, I am pleading to you with upturned eyes, so please decide a worthy name for me, dammit."<br/>
That isn’t the right attitude to ask a favor.<br/>
But only her mouth was bad, and pertaining to me, she did actually apply her all.<br/>
The housework that was hard for Novem alone had become much easier because of her, or so I’ve heard.<br/>
"… Looking at the movement of those twin tails, something’s come to mind."<br/>
As I voiced that, scrap metal took the bait.<br/>
"Oh! For you to lust after these twin tails, you’ve got good eyes there. My makers even got into a fist fight over deciding between black bobbed hair, and these blond twin tails. As I thought, twin tails truly are the greatest."<br/>
"I kinda get a poyo poyo feeling as the move back and forth, so "Poyopoyo" is…"<br/>
(TL: Just imagine the feeling something swinging back and forth leisurely gives off.)<br/>
The scrap metal’s refreshing expression suddenly turned expressionless.<br/>
The one who was holding her stomach in laughter… was Shannon.<br/>
In the past, she was a sightless, frail noble lady, but with her sister being something like that, the younger sister was quite a villain in her own regard.<br/>
"You’ve got no naming sense."<br/>
The one who extended her hand towards the giggling Shannon was Miranda-san.<br/>
She used her left hand to grab the top of her head, squeezed, and lifted her up like that.<br/>
I’m starting to hear a creaking sound.<br/>
"O-onee-sama, it hurts! It really, really hurts!"<br/>
"There’s no point in giving me that cute tone. You’re being rude to Poyopoyo, who finally received her long-awaited name."<br/>
As she said that, Aria covered her mouth.<br/>
Only Novem continued eating while she seemed to be thinking of various things with a serious expression on her face.<br/>
"… Chicken bastard. If it’s now, I will accept a revision."<br/>
Poyopoyo said that, so I shook my head.<br/>
"No alterations, Poyopoyo."<br/>
The Fourth raised an angered voice from within the Jewel…<br/>
"No matter how you look at it, that’s going too far! You have to be nice to girls!"<br/>
And said something like that.<br/>
(There’s no doubt this guy’s wife subjected him to something.)<br/>
From the other’s ancestors’ conduct, I can guess he was quite a submissive husband.<br/>
This man acting up about women, was the head with the longest term of service in the Walt family’s history.<br/>
The Third fell in battle in his thirties, and so he took over the title in his teens.<br/>
From there on, I heard he mostly contributed in domestic affairs, but…<br/>
"And wait, is there really no maintenance costs on that girl? She just sucks Lyle’s Mana, right? If there’s a service fee, wouldn’t that be a pain? Perhaps even a normal servant maid would be better."<br/>
He was also loud about money.<br/>
I heard he handles things on the financial front as well, but when I’m actually here conversing with him, he just keeps prattling on about money.<br/>
It seemed he was the sort of man who would choose money over women.<br/>
That was the Fourth Generation, but only concerning his wife did he ever turn frail.<br/>
His son, the Fifth spoke.<br/>
"Oy, weren’t you saying something about being nice to girls? No wait, while her outside is female, her insides are iron, or something, right?"<br/>
The Fourth…<br/>
"Oh, right… but Poyopoyo is cruel."<br/>
But yeah, perhaps Poyopoyo was a bit much.<br/>
Expressionlessly, Poyopoyo (temp) continued to grumble on about demanding a change.<br/>
"Master, won’t you consider it a bit longer? Please use that meaningless godforsaken brain of yours to think of a name for my sake. I’ll be sure to treasure it. If it’s a proper name, I’ll be sure to treasure it, so…"<br/>
Scary. This automaton is scary.<br/>
"Oy, that’s a little scary, so please stop. I get it. I’ll think. I’ll think about it, so please give me some more time"<br/>
As I said that, the troublesome pile of scrap metal returned a smile.<br/>
"As expected, the chicken dickwad is weak to a woman’s pressure!"<br/>
I also shot back a smile.<br/>
"Only your skin’s a woman, and your insides are black, right? How about we stop denying reality here."<br/>
An angered scrap pile told me.<br/>
"What are you saying? As a special model of the highest grade, there is nothing impossible for me. If I was in the mood, then even a gentleman’s lustful urges are…"<br/>
After she said that much, Novem spoke.<br/>
"We’re in the middle of a meal, Poyopoyo-san."<br/>
The scrap metal bit down on her hankerchief mortifyingly.<br/>
"T-this bitch…"<br/>
Dinner at the Circry House has become lively all of a sudden, but it’s gotten quite enervating.<br/>
–<br/>

"And so, that’s why you’ve come here, is what you’re saying?"<br/>
The Library.<br/>
It was a place meant for one to drop by and store up knowledge, but today, I was reading alongside Clara.<br/>
While we read our books, we exchanged various conversations.<br/>
A while ago, I accepted the request of Damien, a famous professor of Arumsaas, the City of Scholars, and we ended up working together.<br/>
While she specialized in support, she was a skilled adventurer.<br/>
Her deep blue hair was cut around her shoulders, but perhaps she had done that herself, as the edges were quite ruffled.<br/>
It seems she liked reading books here, as whenever I came, I had quite a high probability of finding her.<br/>
I usually ask her about what books are interesting, but we would occasionally exchange such gossip.<br/>
"That’s right. That scrap metal keeps insisting I decide a name, and she competes with Novem."<br/>
"How strange. Could her rivalry with Novem be on her job as a maid?"<br/>
I don’t know that one either.<br/>
I mean, that piece of junk… is broken.<br/>
There’s how she doesn’t remember some important things, but her tone towards me is generally terrible.<br/>
"The individual herself said her sensors labelled her as an enemy or something."<br/>
"Well, she’s an ancient automaton, so it’s amazing enough that she can even move. Ah, come to think of it…"<br/>
Clara remembered something, and conveyed it to me.<br/>
"At the academy, Damien is moving around more automata. He’s gotten three of them operational, and he’s confirming the situation."<br/>
Right now Damien was the talk of the town.<br/>
Just being able to move an ancient automaton and control it was amazing in itself.<br/>
Hearing that, I thought…<br/>
"Why is it that my scrap metal is like that… should I swap it in?"<br/>
Clara responded.<br/>
"She’s properly doing her job, right? Is there some sort of problem?"<br/>
"Her choice of words, I guess? Everything else is perfect. Cleaning, laundry, and cooking, she’ll do it all."<br/>
She really was quite perfect, but I’d like to do something about that mouth.<br/>
"Well, I think you should give up on that. I did hear it was a form of contract, and the means to sever it are as of yet unknown, so you’ll be like that all your life."<br/>
"Please don’t make me remember those things…"<br/>
For the contract to the automaton, my own blood was needed as a catalyst.<br/>
But having just gone through a Growth, my spirits were high, and I went ahead to kiss the Automaton to activate it.<br/>
(Was that where it went wrong? No, she said she got broken of her own accord.)<br/>
"Even so…"<br/>
Clara looked at me.<br/>
"Hmm?"<br/>
"You sure do some troublesome things. Restricting your own Skills, and aiming for the labyrinth’s thirtieth floor?"<br/>
Last time when we challenged the labyrinth, we made it past the fortieth floor’s boss with but a party of six.<br/>
Apparently, it was an enemy that would usually require fifty.<br/>
And it’s good that we achieved results and all, but seeing that, the ancestors imposed a restriction of my Skills until I defeated the thirtieth floor’s boss.<br/>
Under the banner that my own abilities were overwhelmingly lacking, they forbid any such usage of any Skills in my possession.<br/>
Because of that, I somehow have to use my own strength to break through the chappence.<br/>
While it may sound easy in words, the challenge was on a scale where it required from twenty to thirty adventurers.<br/>
"It’s a personal matter. If I remain too reliant on my Skills, then it will be dangerous once my Mana runs out."<br/>
As I expressed the ancestors’ reasoning, Clara made a slight surprised face.<br/>
"… I was sure you hadn’t noticed it, and that you were going to make a huge mistake one day. It seems I’ll have to reassess m evaluation of you, Lyle-san."<br/>
"H-how cruel."<br/>
As I said that, I get the feeling she was smiling a little.<br/>
"If anything happens, call out to me. With your ample funds, I don’t think I would be at a loss to hear you out."<br/>
So it’s a matter of money, I thought… but in truth, to adventurers like us, money was essential.<br/>
In order to live, we threw ourselves into life threatening situations.<br/>
And if the money we obtained was what we used to get by, we had to be firm in that regard.<br/>
Of course, I’ve taken various things onto myself, and I’m in a standing where I have to earn enough to support two women, and one automaton.<br/>
(But really, what is it that I should to)<br/>
If we simply raised greater numbers to challenge it, then it really would be easy.<br/>
But during Damien’s request, I displayed quite a sorry sight.<br/>
(Because I returned to the guild carried by Novem, my reputation… is quite low.)<br/>
At the end of the end, I became unable to move my body, and I showed off quite a terrible state to the other adventurers.<br/>
For that reason, my own personable credibility is low.<br/>
While I want to gather the numbers, my questionable standing in Arumsaas is dragging my feet.<br/>
(As I thought, there’s no choice but for me to steadily build up my own strength.)<br/>
My sudden Growth, and the fact that I produced results was all because of the Heads of History’s Skills recorded in the Jewel.<br/>
If I become unable to use them, it’s exceedingly troublesome.<br/>
(I’ll have to think of a way to overcome the thirtieth floor.)<br/>
As I thought that, I continued to pile up the knowledge of the library.<br/>
