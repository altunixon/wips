Meteor Shield<br/>
Naofumi:"Yo. Old man, Long time to no see."<br/>
Our carriage was stopped behind the weapon shop, and we entered.<br/>
Old Man:"Oh. If it isn’t the lad. I was surprised that you got a bounty a few days after departing."<br/>
Naofumi:"Guess so, I was in a serious trouble back then."<br/>
Old Man:"Apparently it looks like you were able to prove your innocence."<br/>
Naofumi:"Yeah, thanks to your help."<br/>
I felt glad finding out that the old man tried to prove my innocence to the false charges today.<br/>
It’s not just that, he helped me out in various other ways as well.<br/>
Naofumi:"Thank you."<br/>
Old Man:"Stop it, it’s making me itchy."<br/>
The old man scratches his head in embarrassment.<br/>
Old Man:"Though……I don’t think today’s parade was a good idea."<br/>
Naofumi:"Well he’s probably like that normally."<br/>
Old Man:"Back in day he was excellent though."<br/>
Naofumi:"Do you know about it, old man?"<br/>
Old Man:"Hero of the Cane? Was it back when I was ten that the king was still active? I was in another country."<br/>
Naofumi:"I see……"<br/>
Leaving aside Trash’s story, I want to move on to the main topic.<br/>
Since it’s the old man, I should be able to get favorable conditions for weapons without a problem.<br/>
Naofumi:"Since I obtained the queen’s support, I want to ask you to make weapons and armour for me."<br/>
Old Man:"Oh? A special order? Aren’t there other master blacksmiths within the country you can employ?"<br/>
Naofumi:"I came here with expectations of your weapons."<br/>
Old Man:"Lad……"<br/>
The old man seems to be deeply moved, and is holding his feelings back.<br/>
Since I bought most of my equipment till now from his the old man. There is also a sense of security too.<br/>
Old Man:"Then I’ll work hard to answer the lad’s expectations. What do you want made?"<br/>
Naofumi:"Here is the material list."<br/>
I show the old man the material list I got from the queen.<br/>
I don’t know whether or not this amount of materials is too much or too little.<br/>
Naofumi:"Old man, I want you to make weapons and armour that you think are suitable for us from these materials."<br/>
Old Man:"Understood. However, there seems to be some fairly rare materials here. I’m itching to test out my skills. What about the money?"<br/>
Naofumi:"The country can foot the bill."<br/>
Old Man:"The lad has gotten a fairly good position."<br/>
Well it is certainly comfortable.<br/>
There are materials, tutors, social positions, and money for equipment.<br/>
If it’s like this, there is no reason to not stay here.<br/>
I will fight against the wave after all. If there is an advantageous environment, I don’t want to waste time.<br/>
……I’m a little anxious about it, so I should take some precautions.<br/>
Naofumi:"Then……"<br/>
I glance at Raphtalia and Firo.<br/>
Both of them put their equipment, the Karma Dog Claw, and Karma Rabbit Sword on the counter.<br/>
I also point at the penguin suit, and put the ores obtained from Cal Mira Island on the counter.<br/>
Old Man:"You brought a lot lad. Is the missy wearing these like pajamas a companion?"<br/>
Rishia:"Fue?"<br/>
Naofumi:"Yeah, that’s Rishia. Though she has that appearance, the contents are human."<br/>
Rishia:"Naofumi-sama, that explanation is indeed a little……"<br/>
Naofumi:"Can’t be helped. You don’t want to take off that costume."<br/>
Does Rishia like it very much? She seems to be wearing it all the time.<br/>
Her face is always hidden, could it be possible a new fetish came out?<br/>
Old Man:"L-Let’s leave it at that. You brought a strange weapon……This is certainly the perfect weapon for the missy."<br/>
The old man answers while appraising the Karma Rabbit Sword.<br/>
It is difficult to use in various ways, but the offensive power is very high.<br/>
I want to ask the old man’s opinion before we customize or replace it.<br/>
There is also the option of melting and reforging too.<br/>
Naofumi:"The problem is that this thing doesn’t have the Blood Clean Coating. Can you do something about it?"<br/>
Old Man:"To process it at this stage…… It’s accuracy would decline. Is that fine?"<br/>
Naofumi:"I’ll be relying on you."<br/>
Old Man:"Fumu…..That’s fine, but it might be interesting to try some improvements."<br/>
Are you going to add some parts like the barbarian’s armour?<br/>
It might be good to ask about it.<br/>
Old man:"You keep brining me interesting requests lad."<br/>
Naofumi:"I guess. Oh right, old man. Can this child Rishia choose a weapon?"<br/>
Old Man:"Hm? Go ahead…..Take off the suit and show your hand."<br/>
Naofumi:"Rishia."<br/>
Rishia:"I-I like swords."<br/>
Naofumi:"I want to leave the rearguard to you though……"<br/>
After looking at her status I don’t really want her to take the front.<br/>
If she suffers even a scratch, she may just die.<br/>
Both her defence and agility are low. Worst case scenario, she gets caught up in Firo’s kick and dies.<br/>
If it’s the power of magical attacks, even Rishia may be able to manage to some extent in the rear guard while I protect her.<br/>
I’ll ask whether or not she can use ranged magic later, if she can use it, then she can support Raphtalia and Firo from the back with magic.<br/>
Rishia:"I can do either!"<br/>
Old Man:"I appreciate the enthusiasm, but for the time being let me take a look."<br/>
Rishia:"Okay……"<br/>
Rishia timidly takes off the suit and extends her hand to the old man.<br/>
Old Man:"Another beautiful woman. The lad must be happy."<br/>
Naofumi:"Happy? You think that I’m anything like Motoyasu?<br/>
Old Man:"A blockhead as usual huh, the young lady’s troubles increased again."<br/>
Raphtalia:"Yes…..Seriously."<br/>
The old man says that and Raphtalia nods in understanding.<br/>
Old Man:"Fumu…..It looks like you have good compatibility with a rapier. If you want to become a rearguard, then one with a defensive blessing will be good."<br/>
Rishia:"I see, can you choose one for me?"<br/>
Naofumi:"Wait, is there a bow or a spear she can use as well? She doesn’t have any power so I can’t really recommend it."<br/>
Rishia:"Fue……A bow is no good!"<br/>
Naofumi:"Is it unpleasant due to Itsuki?"<br/>
Rishia:"That’s not it, I’m just scared that I will hit somebody."<br/>
Naofumi:"Ah, so that’s it."<br/>
Do I have to worry about friendly fire by accident now?<br/>
It seems her respect for Itsuki is still there……Is he still a hero to her?<br/>
Naofumi:"Anyway, how long would it be?"<br/>
Old Man:"The wave is soon, so a little over a week. I’ll do the best that I can within that timeframe."<br/>
Naofumi:"Understood. And……"<br/>
The Old man asks about the penguin suit.<br/>
Old Man:"How is this done? Can it be disassembled? I mean……Who was it that made this."<br/>
Naofumi:"Ah, that. It’s performance is excellent, but the appearance is bad. A demon dropped it……it’s bad, to put it simply the legendary weapon produced it from the demon’s materials."<br/>
That’s about it. These kinds of things are dropped by demons.<br/>
It makes me realize again that this is a different world. I didn’t realise .<br/>
It’s not funny that I didn’t realise before. Those guys that knew before are strange.<br/>
In the first place, how does a porcupine like animal drop a weapon that has nothing to do with its physique.<br/>
Old Man:"Don’t make such unusual things……Though it’s clear that its effects are excellent……"<br/>
Naofumi:"Can you transfer the effect on to something else?"<br/>
Old Man:"It would be difficult. I’ll give it a try from various angles, but don’t expect too much. At that time, I’ll ask you again since some fine tuning would be needed."<br/>
Naofumi:"I’ll be relying on you. Should I leave the barbarian’s armour here?"<br/>
Old Man:"That’s fine……Just, I’ll be using it as an experimental basis for the missy’s armour."<br/>
For Raphtalia huh. I hope it goes well.<br/>
Raphtalia:"Wh-What is it?"<br/>
Naofumi:"Don’t worry about it."<br/>
A rather unpleasant feeling aches, I don’t know if it’s a bad premonition.<br/>
This feels like a reconstruction that will go bad.<br/>
Rishia:"For some reason it feels exciting."<br/>
……The expectations of a fan of stuffed animals.<br/>
It seems like this will go down a bad direction.<br/>
For someone like Rishia to excitedly anticipate something, it’s quite a flag.<br/>
At worst, would I have Rishia wear it?<br/>
Firo:"Master~ can we go yet?"<br/>
Naofumi:"Yeah, ten more minutes.’<br/>
Throughout the whole thing, Firo has been quietly carrying the materials.<br/>
That reminds me……There are some other materials that I unexpectedly got on the island.<br/>
Materials not available when I give priority to drops.<br/>
Drops not obtained when I give priority to materials.<br/>
It was difficult.<br/>
Naofumi:"Oh right, I completely forgot about it. Hey old man, can you show me your shields?"<br/>
Old Man:"I don’t really think you need a shield right……? Ah, is it for the young ladies?"<br/>
Naofumi:"It’s something else. It’s fine to tell you about it."<br/>
I tell the old man about weapon copy.<br/>
As expected, he is frowning.<br/>
Old Man:"To blatantly say towards me the shopkeeper, that you are performing a theft."<br/>
Naofumi:"Should I do it silently instead? I think it should be a service provided by the country."<br/>
Old Man:"Well……The other heroes are doing it silently……. Can’t be helped. It doesn’t matter if its the lad’s request. I’ll show you my favorite."<br/>
With that, I copied every shield that the old man had in his shop.<br/>
I copied various shields, such as the Magic Silver Shield, Heavy Shield, Iron Shell Shield, Magic Shield, and so on…….<br/>
Is the Iron Shield and Iron Shell Shield different?…… Magic Shield seems to be a shield that can convert magical power in to a shield.<br/>
I mean, I have heard it before, but is the shield an item that is considered a weapon after all?<br/>
It’s naturally being sold at a weapon store.<br/>
I’m not complaining since I am copying the shields one by one.<br/>
Well I have consent from the owner.<br/>
Old Man:"That should be it, ah wait a moment lad."<br/>
After saying so the old man goes to the back of the store.<br/>
I heard the sound of him going upstairs, and there is a lot of clanking going on.<br/>
The old man returned after a while.<br/>
Old Man:"Thanks for waiting. This is a shield that is rare in this country."<br/>
It’s quite boorish…… However the shield that the old man brought also has a strange luster to it.<br/>
Is the metal used iron? However, there is a strange atmosphere.<br/>
I appraise and judge it.<br/>
Iron Meteorite Shield Quality: Normal<br/>
Naofumi:"Iron meteorite?"<br/>
Old Man:"Yeah, this shield is made of an unusual ore that fell from the sky. It’s a display product of Zeltbull. A prototype of the iron meteorite series."<br/>
Naofumi:"I see……Hm? Display product? Why do you have it?"<br/>
Old Man:"It’s from back in the day."<br/>
Naofumi:"Uh huh."<br/>
I wonder why this article is not for sale.<br/>
Ah, Motoyasu was saying that Zeltbull had a good assortment of weapons.<br/>
Did he touch and copy one?<br/>
Old Man:"Here, try it."<br/>
Naofumi:"Ah, Right."<br/>
I take the iron meteorite shield handed to me by the old man.<br/>
And I activate Weapon Copy!<br/>
Iron Meteorite Shield 0/20 C<br/>
Ability Unsealed……Equipment Bonus: Skill [Meteor Shield]<br/>
Proficiency 0<br/>
It finally appeared!<br/>
The shield version of the meteor series those other heroes used!<br/>
By the way, there are various colours, but that’s normal in the status system.<br/>
Am I now part of the foolish four?<br/>
Well, that depends on its efficiency.<br/>
I change my shield to the Iron Meteorite Shield.<br/>
Old Man:"Ooh"<br/>
The old man speaks in surprise.<br/>
Naofumi:"A strange skill appeared, let me try it out."<br/>
Old Man:"Wha—-Hey!"<br/>
Naofumi:"Meteor Shield!"<br/>
And, I shout. A thin wall of light appears around me. it’s effect is 2 meters centering around me.<br/>
Sp consumption is……Around 5% of it all. The cool down time is short, 15 seconds huh.<br/>
Based on what I saw, I have a feeling that this is a skill that creates a defense wall.<br/>
Raphtalia:"What kind of skill is it?"<br/>
Naofumi:"I think it’s a skill that will create a defensive wall……"<br/>
Raphtalia:"Hah."<br/>
Raphtalia touches the wall surrounding me……for some reason she slipped right through.<br/>
Raphtalia:"Is it something different?"<br/>
Firo:"Hmm~……"<br/>
Rishia and Firo slip through the same way.<br/>
Since the Meteor skills of those other guys had such high-efficiency, I didn’t think it would be a garbage skill.<br/>
Old Man:"Seriously, don’t do something strange within the shop—Fube"<br/>
The old man tries to pass through the wall but gets knocked back.<br/>
Naofumi:"Ah, can only party members pass through?"<br/>
Depending on its durability, it is a skill that can work as ranged protection.<br/>
If I think of its uses, it’s quite excellent.<br/>
And……The effective time is about 5 minutes. While factoring in the cool down time, this is quite an excellent skill.<br/>
Old Man:"Good grief, think about it for a little before you do anything lad."<br/>
Naofumi:"Sorry, I wanted you to see it since it is your best."<br/>
Old Man:"If you say any more, it will become a complaint."<br/>
Naofumi:"I’ll leave it at that for now."<br/>
Afterwards, I told him about Motoyasu’s tempering technique with ore.<br/>
There is some in the material list, there is a delicate line to align until it’s satisfactory<br/>
There is fewer compared to other ores.<br/>
It’s possible that Trash wanted to gather it for Motoyasu, but the queen was a step ahead.<br/>
Since a lot of it is necessary, I need to think of a different way to obtain it.<br/>
Naofumi:"See you later old man. If you need anything for the weapon shop, just ask the castle with these documents."<br/>
Old Man:"I understand lad. Please wait expectantly."<br/>
Naofumi:"Yeah, I’ll be relying on you."<br/>
Thus we left the weapon shop.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
