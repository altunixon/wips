<br/>
"Sorry, Nina-san, to have you help me out." (Makoto)<br/>
"No no, Goshujin-sama told me to lend as much help as possible." (Nina)<br/>
Right now we are not inside Laberintos, but outside of it.<br/>
We are aiming for the ceiling of the underground lake from the outside of the dungeon.<br/>
It is only Nina-san and I.<br/>
The reason is because I can only use Stealth on 2 people.<br/>
Sa-san is in the middle of practicing the Skill.<br/>
I used Mapping on Laberintos for 3 days to search every nook and cranny, but I couldn’t find a path to the harpy’s nest.<br/>
Harpies are flying monsters, so there’s a high chance that there’s no path that can be reached by foot.<br/>
And so, we decided on exploring the outside of the dungeon where the area that serves as an atrium for the underground lake is located at.<br/>
"The trees are troublesome." (Makoto)<br/>
The outside of the dungeon is thick in trees that block the view.<br/>
"Takatsuki-sama, be careful. Even though we are not inside the dungeon, there’s still a chance that there’s monsters." (Nina)<br/>
"With my Detection Skill and your Eavesdrop Skill, I don’t think we won’t be able to notice." (Makoto)<br/>
A rabbitkin like Nina-san apparently has the best sense of hearing within the beastkin.<br/>
"There’s monsters." (Makoto)<br/>
"Yeah, let’s circumvent them." (Nina)<br/>
When we pick ji the presence of monsters, we take a detour to avoid unnecessary battles.<br/>
Because of that, we were taking time in our way.<br/>
"…"<br/>
"…"<br/>
We push aside the plants while slowly advancing.<br/>
Silence continued.<br/>
Hmm, it is tough that I can’t say one single considerate thing.<br/>
People like Sakurai-kun probably wouldn’t have problems making conversation.<br/>
Is what I was thinking, when Nina-san threw a conversation at me.<br/>
"Takatsuki-sama, you have been friends with Goshujin-sama since the time of your previous world, right?" (Nina)<br/>
"Yeah. But well, we were only acquainted with each other for 1 year in the previous world though." (Makoto)<br/>
Even so, I have been helped out by Fuji-yan a whole lot.<br/>
No amount of gratitude would be enough.<br/>
"There’s something I want to ask Takatsuki-sama." (Nina)<br/>
"What is it?" (Makoto)<br/>
Something about Fuji-yan?<br/>
"What kind of girls does Goshujin-sama like?" (Nina)<br/>
So it is that type of conversation, huh.<br/>
Even if you ask a person like me whose age is equal to the amount of time without a girlfriend…<br/>
But I have been under the care of Nina-san.<br/>
Let’s take care of this in a gentlemanly way.<br/>
"He basically likes beast eared girls." (Makoto)<br/>
This is the truth.<br/>
No doubt about it.<br/>
Cause you know, I have been hit with a conversation of how great beast ears are for around 100 times already when we are drinking at Beast Ear Garden.<br/>
"I know that though…" (Nina)<br/>
Nina-san’s long ears droop dejected.<br/>
"Are you uneasy about something?" (Makoto)<br/>
"No matter how much I try to make moves on him, he doesn’t follow through." (Nina)<br/>
"…"<br/>
"Just before, I entered his room with quite the risque clothing, but he didn’t do anything…" (Nina)<br/>
It was more of an adult consultation than I thought! <br/>
It’s impossible… This conversation is too much for me.<br/>
Why aren’t you doing anything, Fuji-yan?! <br/>
Nina-san is cute! <br/>
"Could it be that he doesn’t notice my feelings…?" (Nina)<br/>
"No, I don’t think that’s the case." (Makoto)<br/>
He 100% notices, so it is okay!<br/>
He can read minds after all!<br/>
"If nothing works, I will just have to pounce him at night…" (Nina)<br/>
"…" <br/>
Nina-san, even though you are a rabbit, you are carnivorous!<br/>
"It looks like the daughter of the Feudal Lord of Makkaren has an interest in Goshujin-sama…" (Nina)<br/>
"Aah, Christiana-san, right?" (Makoto)<br/>
"She is a dirty person! In order to secure the course of the Flying Ship of Goshujin-sama, she demanded a variety of things." (Nina)<br/>
Well, that’s how a person in power works.<br/>
"I will try asking Fuji-yan next time." (Makoto)<br/>
"Please do!" (Nina)<br/>
I just accepted easily there, but was that okay? <br/>
While we were having that kind of conversation, we were closing in on the objective.<br/>
"According to the Mapping Skill, we are close to the top of the underground lake." (Makoto)<br/>
"The Mapping Skill of Takatsuki-sama has quite the accuracy. To think it can cover such a vast area." (Nina)<br/>
Really?<br/>
I didn’t really pay much attention to it. <br/>
"Let’s stop here. There’s harpies." (Makoto)<br/>
"Yeah, lookouts. 3 of them." (Nina)<br/>
I only caught 2 with Detection.<br/>
It really is good that Nina-san is here.<br/>
After watching for a while, the lookout harpies shifted places with harpies that came out from the hole.<br/>
Looks like there’s no doubt their nest is somewhere around there.<br/>
"We have mostly pinpointed the location of the nest." (Makoto)<br/>
"The lookouts will be a problem though." (Nina)<br/>
"Let’s return for now." (Makoto)<br/>
We stealthily return to the Adventurer City in a way that the harpies don’t notice us.<br/>
 ◇◇<br/>
"And so, it looks like there’s no doubt that the nest of the harpies is at the top of the underground lake area." (Makoto)<br/>
"That’s where she is…" (Aya)<br/>
The eyes of Sa-san sharpen.<br/>
"There’s one piece of good news-desu zo", Fujiwara says.<br/>
"It looks like Sakurai-dono and the Sun Knight Order have subjugated the Taboo Dragon." (Fujiwara)<br/>
"Ah! It is true that the Adventurer Guild was noisy today. So that’s why." (Lucy)<br/>
Lucy who has been gathering information in the guild and training hammered her hand in realization.<br/>
"Hoh, as expected of Sakurai-kun. It hasn’t even been 1 week since coming to Laberintos, and yet, they have already finished the subjugation." (Makoto)<br/>
"About that, it looks like they aren’t done." (Fujiwara)<br/>
"What do you mean by that, Goshujin-sama?" (Nina)<br/>
"There’s apparently 3 Taboo Dragons." (Fujiwara)<br/>
"Eh? That many?!" (Makoto)<br/>
That sounds like bad news instead.<br/>
"Then, that means the actions of the monsters in Laberintos will be staying weird…" (Lucy)<br/>
Lucy is feeling down.<br/>
She hasn’t been able to go into the dungeon lately after all.<br/>
"So, when are we going to defeat the harpy?" (Aya)<br/>
The voice of Sa-san is tough.<br/>
"I think it would be safer if we do it after all the Taboo Dragons are subjugated though…" (Fujiwara)<br/>
"When will that be?" (Aya)<br/>
"I can’t tell that far…" (Fujiwara)<br/>
Even if they managed to subjugate the Taboo Dragon this time around, there’s no assurance that they will be able to do so for the next ones.<br/>
Laberintos is big, and it is not like it is sure that the Sun Knight Order will win.<br/>
"Let’s make the subjugation of the harpies 3 days from now. At the very least, let’s strengthen my Spirit Magic enough. Also, let’s wait until Lucy’s magic is ready." (Makoto)<br/>
"Lucy-san, can you be ready in 3 days?" (Aya)<br/>
"Your eyes are scary, Aya… Got it! Leave it to me." (Lucy)<br/>
"It is settled then." (Nina)<br/>
Nina-san looks at everyone.<br/>
I take over.<br/>
"Then, 3 days from now, let’s subjugate the Harpy Queen." (Makoto)<br/>
<br/>
Chapter 48: VS Harpies<br/>
<br/>
The night before the fight against the harpies.<br/>
I had a dream.<br/>
A space of nothing -the room of the Goddess.<br/>
It has been a while.<br/>
I lowered to my knees and placed my hands together.<br/>
The Goddess appeared with ice in mouth and fanning herself.<br/>
Also, she has a rough appearance wearing a t-shirt and spats.<br/>
Or more like, that’s super erotic.<br/>
(Eeeh…) (Makoto)<br/>
"Oh my? You came?" (Noah)<br/>
She turns my way while fanning her chest.<br/>
I really would like you to have a proper attire at least in the rare instances when your believer visits you.<br/>
It is a waste of your beauty.<br/>
"I can hear what you are saying in your mind, you know." (Noah)<br/>
"Your attire is immodest, Goddess-sama." (Makoto)<br/>
"Hey. You are lacking in faith." (Noah)<br/>
"I pray everyday." (Makoto)<br/>
The Goddess pouts with a ‘muuh’.<br/>
Let’s leave the light talk here.<br/>
"Thank you very much. It is thanks to Goddess-sama that I was able to meet Sasaki-san." (Makoto)<br/>
"Hm, be grateful." (Noah)<br/>
Even if you say that with ice in your mouth…<br/>
"By the way, Makoto. Why are you not trying to get along with the Light Hero-kun?" (Noah)<br/>
Hm?<br/>
"He is one of the believers of the Holy Gods that you hate though. Is it okay to get along with him?" (Makoto)<br/>
"Don’t worry about those things. You can get along with him and later you can make use of him, right?" (Noah)<br/>
The Goddess says dark stuff as always.<br/>
"Using a classmate of mine is a bit…" (Makoto)<br/>
I am ethically adverse to the idea.<br/>
"He will become a key person in the future of this continent. Don’t complain and get along with him. You got to reunite with your friend when you followed what I said, right?" (Noah)<br/>
"I am grateful for that, but…" (Makoto)<br/>
"Sasaki Aya-chan has it nice. If it is in Stats alone, she is hero class, you know. The magic of Lucy-chan is slowly getting stronger, too. Your party is shaping up well." (Noah)<br/>
"The supposed leader is weak though." (Makoto)<br/>
Even if my surroundings alone get strong…<br/>
"Stats are decoration. You just need a big move that can turn the tides in one go! Keep mastering Spirit Magic." (Noah)<br/>
Her instructions lately have gotten specific.<br/>
"For now, don’t go getting defeated by something like harpies." (Noah)<br/>
She ruffles my hair.<br/>
I felt like power was welling up in me.<br/>
Did she bring me here to encourage me?<br/>
"Please leave it to me, Goddess-sama." (Makoto)<br/>
I bowed, and by the time I raised my head, the Goddess was already gone.<br/>
◇◇<br/>
"Okay, let’s go." (Makoto)<br/>
"Is it really okay to go at this early hour?" (Lucy)<br/>
Lucy is rubbing her eyes sleepily. <br/>
Time is 2:00 a.m.<br/>
It is time to leave for the subjugation of the Harpy Queen.<br/>
"I thought for sure we were going in the morning." (Nina)<br/>
"That’s naive-desu zo, Nina-dono! This world is the strong eat the weak. We have to stab at the weakness of the enemies mercilessly. Harpies are bird monsters. Their vision lowers at night." (Fujiwara)<br/>
"We Lamias were attacked in our sleep. I will get them back for that!" (Aya)<br/>
Sa-san was excited.<br/>
"The harpies should be sleeping deeply right now. Let’s give them eternal sleep." (Makoto)<br/>
"Makoto, you are saying some scary stuff there." (Lucy)<br/>
I said that to Sa-san, but Lucy retorted.<br/>
"Lucy and I will come from the outside of the dungeon. Nina-san and Sa-san will be on standby at the underground lake. The time of the attack will be in 2 hours from now, at 4. Fuji-yan, you wait for the good news and the materials of the Harpy Queen." (Makoto)<br/>
"Umu, be careful not to forget any necessary items. I pray for your victory!" (Fujiwara)<br/>
We all nodded lightly and departed.<br/>
◇◇<br/>
"The nights at the outside forest of Laberintos are dark and creepy." (Lucy)<br/>
I was walking with Lucy who is grabbing my arm tightly with Stealth activated.<br/>
"I have been walking several round trips in the past 3 days, so this is like a walk in the park for me." (Makoto)<br/>
"…Wasn’t it hard?" (Lucy)<br/>
"No, it was fun." (Makoto)<br/>
"You are weird." (Lucy)<br/>
Careful preparations before a boss fight.<br/>
We shouldn’t slacken our hand in this part.<br/>
My excitement is rising a bit.<br/>
"The mist is thick. It is good that vision is bad though…" (Lucy)<br/>
"I asked the Spirits to make this mist. Quite the good idea, right?" (Makoto)<br/>
"This large of a scale?! Hngh?!" (Lucy)<br/>
"You are being loud." (Makoto)<br/>
We silently advanced while I covered the mouth of Lucy.<br/>
But the path is long.<br/>
There’s nothing else to do.<br/>
Now that I think about it, I haven’t asked Fuji-yan about the girl matters that Nina-san requested me of.<br/>
Once this battle ends, let’s invite him to drinks.<br/>
(Don’t go raising weird flags.) (Noah)<br/>
My bad, Goddess-sama.<br/>
I’ll be careful.<br/>
"Hey, Makoto." (Lucy)<br/>
After a while of walking, Lucy spoke to me.<br/>
"About the other day when I went out together with Aya." (Lucy)<br/>
"Aah, did you get along better?" (Makoto)<br/>
What kind of conversations did they have?<br/>
"So-so. The food of the Lamias was bad, so she was moved by the menu of the restaurants and cafes." (Lucy)<br/>
"Yeah, she apparently only ate raw fish and nuts." (Makoto)<br/>
When I heard about the diet of Sa-san, I really felt pity for her.<br/>
"She said she wanted to eat sweet things, but there’s not that many of those in the city of Laberintos." (Lucy)<br/>
"Speaking of that, Fuji-yan said he would be bringing chocolate. What other thing did you talk about?" (Makoto)<br/>
"…"<br/>
Hm?<br/>
Did they only talk about food?<br/>
"Also…she told me about how you were in your previous world." (Lucy)<br/>
"I was only a game-loving loner." (Makoto)<br/>
Sa-san hasn’t said anything weird, I hope.<br/>
"I spoke to Aya about how you were in Makkaren." (Lucy)<br/>
Hm?<br/>
"Why is it all about me…?" (Makoto)<br/>
"Because Aya wanted to hear about it. I also wanted to hear about the past of you, Makoto." (Lucy)<br/>
"Is that so…" (Makoto)<br/>
That’s a bit embarrassing. <br/>
But was that even a fun conversation?<br/>
◇◇<br/>
"It is about time. Lucy, wait here." (Makoto)<br/>
"Okay. You are going to defeat the lookouts, right?" (Lucy)<br/>
"Yeah." (Makoto)<br/>
I unsheath my dagger while saying this, and set Clear Mind to a high value.<br/>
The vision is the worst because of the thick fog, but with Detection and Night Vision, I can tell the location of the harpies.<br/>
The enemy hasn’t noticed.<br/>
I erased my footsteps, and hit the neck and heart of the harpy with two hits from the back.<br/>
I control the blood with water magic in a way so that it doesn’t splash onto me.<br/>
I also finished 3 harpies that were on top of a big rock, a low tree branch, and close to the big hole that connects to Laberintos.<br/>
I already knew beforehand that there’s still quite a bit of time before their shifts.<br/>
"Lucy, I am done." (Makoto)<br/>
"It hasn’t even been 5 minutes… Aren’t you suited to be an assassin?" (Lucy)<br/>
"There’s no profession like that." (Makoto)<br/>
I have Skills suited for assassinations, but there’s no Assassin class. <br/>
On paper, that is.<br/>
We approach the big hole connecting to Laberintos, and we slowly peek inside.<br/>
At the ceiling of Laberintos, there’s a giant bird nest made of wood and ivy. <br/>
The nest of the harpies.<br/>
"Lucy, I leave it to you." (Makoto)<br/>
"Alright. I will gift them an especially big one for the sake of Aya." (Lucy)<br/>
Saying this, she begins chanting.<br/>
With the staff of Lucy, gifted by the old man giant, she can skip the chant for the Stone Bullet at least. <br/>
But this time around, she is doing spells that call several big rocks at once.<br/>
Giant boulders appear one after the other.<br/>
"Be clad in fire; [Fire Element Grant]." (Lucy)<br/>
The giant boulders burn red.<br/>
It began to light up the area like the sunset.<br/>
"Lucy! The harpies are beginning to notice!" (Makoto)<br/>
There’s several of them peeking out from their nest and looking over here.<br/>
But it is too late!<br/>
"[Meteor Shower]!" (Lucy)<br/>
Lucy swings her staff, and the burning boulders are shot, taking out the harpies along with the harpy nest.<br/>
<br/>
Ear-piercing shrieks echo into the dungeon.<br/>
