This is an explanation of the races of Lambda that have made an appearance. There are some that have already been explained as monsters, but they will be explained as races of people here.<br/>
 <br/>
The definition of people in Lambda<br/>
 <br/>
These are separated into three major different ways of thinking.<br/>
First, for the gods like Alda whose objective is the annihilation of Vida’s races, Alda fundamentalists and anti-Vida advocates, Vida’s races are not people. Only three races, the humans, Elves and Dwarves, classify as people. (That is why Alda said that Lambda’s total population is less than 100,000,000, but in reality, including Vida’s races, the population is over 100,000,000.)<br/>
Next, for Alda’s peaceful faction, the neutral gods, their believers and most normal people, so to speak, in addition to the above races, Vida’s races that don’t have monster ancestors, such as Dark Elves, Titans and Beast-people, classify as people.<br/>
The largest number of people use this definition compared to the other two.<br/>
The last is the inclusion of races that have monster ancestors, such as Vampires.<br/>
This definition is least used. Because there are those such as Vampires who work for evil gods, very few consider all races to be people, even if they are believers of Vida.<br/>
 <br/>
 <br/>
Half-breeds<br/>
 <br/>
Other than half-Elves and Dhampirs, the Statuses of children born to parents of different races usually display the race of one of the parents’ races.<br/>
However, in many cases, the special racial traits of the parents manifest on the body. A human man born between a human and a Dwarf would have good vision in the dark and grow a plentiful beard, possessing exceptional physical strength and an affinity for the earth and fire attributes. A Titan born between an Elf and a Titan would have a large body easily surpassing 2.5 meters in height, but their ears would be pointed and they would possess the qualities for spiritual magic from birth. There are other similar examples.<br/>
Although these aren’t reflected in skills or Attribute Values, sometimes there are cases where scales grow on the body or feathers grow on the arms.<br/>
Lifespans can differ on a case-by-case basis, but they can be roughly estimated by averaging the expected lifespans of the parents.<br/>
Also, there are cases where children born to parents of the same race are born with special characteristics of other races, or even born as an individual of a different race altogether. In the past, the mother’s faithfulness was questioned in such cases, or sometimes this was called the prank or even a blessing of a god, but this is now known to be a result of atavism.<br/>
The above examples do not include half-breeds with monsters such as Goblins and Orcs.<br/>
 <br/>
 <br/>
Humans<br/>
 <br/>
The equivalent of humans on Earth or in Origin.<br/>
They have the lowest base Attribute Values among any race, but at the same time, they are the race that is thriving the most. The reason for that is said to be that the extent of their freedom is great; there are no Jobs that are suited or ill-suited for humans as a race.<br/>
There are all kinds of humans; there are some with low aptitude with magic while others have great aptitude for magic; there are some with affinity for only one attribute while others have an affinity for all attributes (with the exception of the death attribute).<br/>
As if to demonstrate the humans’ extent of freedom, if one separates heroes that appear in legends and myths by race, there are more human heroes than heroes of the other races. But on the other hand, there are many ordinary people who would struggle to fight a single Goblin.<br/>
Their life expectancy is around fifty to sixty years, but because infants of breast-feeding age often die of disease and such, once humans safely pass that age, they can even live for over eighty years.<br/>
Also, those who have experienced multiple Jobs and increased their Attribute Values age slower; there were some human adventurers in the past who actively worked for over a hundred years.<br/>
In many nations, humans are treated as adults starting from the age of fifteen.<br/>
There are no sub-races, but there are ethnicities with white, yellow or black skin color.<br/>
Humans can generally create offspring with almost any other race.<br/>
 <br/>
 <br/>
Elves<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
(adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({});<br/>
<br/>
The race born between Shizarion, the god of wind and art, and Peria, the goddess of water and knowledge. They are known to have long, pointed ears and exceptional physical appearances.<br/>
As their ancestral roots lie in Shizarion and Peria, they have great Agility and Intelligence, but they are often physically weaker than humans.<br/>
There are many Elves who possess an affinity for the wind and water elements from birth, and few possess an affinity for the attributes that are poorly compatible with these attributes, the earth and fire attributes.<br/>
They possess the Dark Vision skill from birth. Also, though this does not apply for all Elves, many acquire the Spiritual Magic skill, so they are sometimes called the friends of the spirits.<br/>
Their lifespans are as long as five hundred years; they age at the same pace as humans until their teenage years, and after that, they grow into adults at a rate of one physical year of age every several human years. When they are treated as adults varies based on the nation and clan, but they are generally regarded as adults from around fifty to sixty years of age. In cases where they are raised in human cities, they are treated as adults from age fifteen despite looking very young.<br/>
Sometimes Elf children are seen in towns giving orders to adults in a self-important manner, but they are simply Elves in their thirties giving orders to newcomers who are over a decade younger than them.<br/>
Because they have long lifespans, their sense of time is looser than that of humans; they are often gentle in nature. There are also more than a few who use their long lifespans to earn Experience Points over a long period of time to reach B-class or A-class… if they survive that long.<br/>
As adventurers, they are suited to being mages or using their speed to be lightly-equipped warriors or scouts.<br/>
As civilians, many Elves are artists or scholars.<br/>
In the past, there were large-scale villages of tens of thousands of Elves, though they were very different from human nations.<br/>
Elf villages are mostly located in forests or on lakes, and there are even nomadic tribes that build fleets of ships and sail as they live their lives.<br/>
The fact that they are vegetarians and do not eat meat is a mere rumor; they treat both meat and vegetables as blessings of nature and eat both equally.<br/>
When living in human nations, they are almost never in positions where they need to succeed noble families and such. Even those with occupations often retire after working for a few decades. Because their lifespans are long, even if they are noblemen, the nations that they live in will either be destroyed before their own lives end, divide into multiple nations or be merged with other nations, so there is no stability. Also, the Elves have historically learned that if they maintain their social statuses for too long, dissatisfaction grows in those of races with shorter lifespans.<br/>
Some Elves are disgusted by Dark Elves, treating them as corrupted Elves, but there is a myth telling of how after Shizarion was destroyed and Peria entered a slumber, Vida protected the ancestors of the Elves. Thus, there are also Elves with a deep belief in Vida, and those Elves are friendly towards Vida’s races, especially the Dark Elves, whom they welcome as brothers and sisters who have received the goddess’s blessings.<br/>
There is no consistent philosophy of love among the Elf race; there is a wide variety of Elves, ranging from those who are sociable and court members of the opposite sex even after only meeting them once, to others who thoroughly get to know potential partners before making a decision. It is said that this is because Elves either inherit the nature of Shizarion, who had many romantic interests, or that of Peria, who was more discreet.<br/>
Also, it seems that many Elves believe that finding each person’s different beauty and charm regardless of their appearance is a part of love… though this is likely not insignificantly due to the fact that all Elves have beautiful appearances.<br/>
But Elves often become deeply attached to the partners that they have decided upon. A certain human mage left behind the words, “If an Elf truly falls in love with you, you will be dragged around for your whole life, so give up on them.”<br/>
Also, Dwarves are the only race that Elves cannot directly create offspring with. Due to this, the racial relations between Elves and Dwarves once became complicated.<br/>
Perhaps because of that incident, there are quite a number of Elves who enjoy playing with fire by having relations with Dwarves.<br/>
 <br/>
 <br/>
Dwarves<br/>
 <br/>
A race with ancestral roots in Zantark, the god of fire and destruction, and Botin, mother of the earth and goddess of craftsmanship. Even after reaching adulthood, their height only reaches the chests of humans. Dwarf men are known for growing plentiful beards once they become adults, while women maintain the appearances of young girls despite being adults (with large individual differences in figures).<br/>
Perhaps because their ancestral roots lie in Zantark and Botin, while they have exceptional Strength, Stamina and Vitality, their Agility and Intelligence are a little lower than that of humans.<br/>
Many Dwarves have an affinity for the fire and earth attributes, but there are few who possess an affinity for the opposite attributes, the wind and water attributes.<br/>
Also, Dwarves possess the Dark Vision skill from birth.<br/>
Their lifespans are around two hundred years. They develop at the same pace as humans, and once they reach the adult age of fifteen, their aging becomes very slow. They remain healthy until the age of one hundred and eighty, but after that, they often age rapidly.<br/>
They have longer lifespans than humans, but they are often picky about time and stubborn in personality. But they are not short-tempered; they enjoy training or raising things to the point that they make these their life goals. Also, they are a race that enjoys alcohol more than relations between men and women, to the point that it is often said that if one wants to marry a Dwarf girl, they should send alcohol to her father or defeat him in a drinking contest.<br/>
As adventurers, they are suited to being shield-bearers and frontline fighters, and not suited to being mages or scouts. Also, many Dwarves are religious, so there are cases where they become priests.<br/>
As civilians, they are often blacksmiths, stonemasons, potters, leatherworkers, arms smiths or chefs, and there are many who set their sights on farming as well. It is often said that when choosing a craftsman, an Elf craftsman would be best for aesthetics, while a Dwarf craftsman would be best for performance.<br/>
Although society praises the skill of some of these craftsmen, there are almost none who become noblemen and such. Other than cases where a Dwarf accepts a court rank in order to protect the rights and homes of his brethren, most of them are honorary noblemen, nobles in name only.<br/>
Other than the Workers’ Guild, most Guild branches have at least one Dwarf among the medium to high-ranking leaders.<br/>
There are no races that the Dwarves consider enemies, and although they frequently quarrel with Elves due to their differing views, they do not hate them.<br/>
They do not hold anything against Vida’s races, either. However, they laugh off the fact that Dwarves were the only race that Vida did not mate with to create a new race, saying that the Dwarven men of the past must have drank her under the table. They warn young Dwarf boys, saying that they should learn from their ancestors’ example and not become the kind of men who would assault drunken women.<br/>
… However, it seems that they do not mind vigorously deepening their bonds with moderately drunk members of the opposite sex who have not passed out.<br/>
The Dwarves’ perception of love is such that the men are not domineering husbands that demand that their wives follow their requests, but husbands who want their wives to keep them under control. This is thought to be the influence of Zantark’s words of, “Men should fight and work outside while their wives protect the homes.”<br/>
This is why Dwarf men like strong-minded, firm women. Also, it seems that they find voluptuous women more charming than dainty ones.<br/>
Dwarf women think of men as one of the raw materials that they need to temper; it seems that they are attracted to men who they feel are worth the effort of strengthening. Thus, although Dwarf couples do quarrel, this is often a whip of love from the wife.<br/>
Also, an important feature that all Dwarf men should have to charm Dwarf women is their beards.<br/>
However, more recently, there are many among the youngest generation of Dwarves that do not fall under the above descriptions. There is an emotional play about a Dwarf woman reforming a hopeless human man who was loved by everyone. This play was actually the story of the beginning of the romance between the playwright’s parents.<br/>

 <br/>
Dark Elves<br/>
 <br/>
A race born between Vida, the goddess of life and love, and a young Elf who was serving her.<br/>
Their appearance is exactly the same as that of Elves other than their dark skin; they are sometimes referred to as “suntanned Elves.” Also, old books say that Dark Elves have more sensual figures than Elves due to being descendants of a goddess who also rules over abundance and prosperity. However, in later years, the ‘Extraordinary and Odd’ Dario Dan, who was renowned as both a mage and as an artist, gathered a thousand Elves and a thousand Dark Elves to cooperate in an investigation, through which he determined that this rumor is not true.<br/>
Like Elves, Dark Elves possess the qualities for using magic, but they also possess exceptional physical qualities such as Vitality and Strength. In other words, they have high overall Attribute Values; there are no areas in which they are inferior to humans.<br/>
They can possess an affinity for any attribute, and like Elves, there are many who awaken to Spiritual Magic.<br/>
They possess the Dark Vision and Magic Resistance skills from birth.<br/>
They have long lifespans of a thousand years. Excluding the Vampires, who do not age at all, Dark Elves have the longest lifespan as a race. (There are some among the Drakonids and Majin) who live longer than a thousand years, but they do not have longer average lifespans as a race; there are just large individual differences.)<br/>
Dark Elves age at the same pace as humans up to their teenage years, and after that, they age at a rate of one physical year of age every several human years, and at a certain stage, their growth (aging) stops. There are individual differences in when this period occurs; it can occur as early as the mid-teenage years or as late as the early thirties.<br/>
But unlike Elves, once their growth stops, they maintain this appearance for the rest of their lives, so it is possible for elderly individuals who have lived for nine hundred years to have the appearance of boys or girls in their mid-teenage years.<br/>
The mental ages of Dark Elves are strongly influenced by how old they appear to be. Perhaps due to this, they do not have a custom of respecting their elders unconditionally. They will always be treated as immature until they develop appropriate knowledge, skills and personalities.<br/>
But many Dark Elves respect those who show themselves to be mature, so they are also a race that is easy to get along with.<br/>
Because they have longer lifespans than Elves, many Dark Elves have somewhat carefree personalities. Some live as adventurers or as civilians, but with their sense of time, they consider these things to be “training,” “studying abroad” or “a bit of a long journey.” There are almost none who intend to spend their entire lives in human society… because most nations are likely to be destroyed or divide before they reach the ends of their lifespans.<br/>
But there are no Jobs as adventurers that they are particularly suited for, and they can use their long lifespans to learn all kinds of occupations as civilians.<br/>
Historically, Dark Elves have kept their distance except from Elves who believe in Vida, but they are not hostile as a race. However, many Dark Elves hate the very sight of priests of Alda.<br/>
Dark Elves’ perception of marriage is peculiar and quite uninhibited. Because they have long lifespans, so even if they swear to love each other for eternity, arguments and affairs can happen if they spend hundreds of years together, so most Dark Elves make an oath to give each other “one hundred years of love.” If they wish to remain a couple after those one hundred years pass, they repeat their oath for another hundred years in front of a statue of the goddess. Repeating this practice is marriage for the Dark Elves.<br/>
If they have changed their minds, they can simply divorce on the spot, so it is said that Dark Elves are the race that spills the least blood over romantic complications.<br/>
 <br/>
 <br/>
Titans<br/>
 <br/>
The race born between Vida, the goddess of life and love, and the Sun Giant Talos, who served the Colossus god Zerno. They were the first race to be created by Vida.<br/>
They have light-brown, sun-kissed skin. They are a race of large individuals; once they reach adulthood, men are over 2.7 meters tall while women are over 2.5m tall.<br/>
Other than the color of their skin and their size, they are no different from humans. There is a well-known comedy where a nobleman has his heart captivated by a healthy, beautiful girl with light-brown skin depicted in a painting and goes to confess to her, only to find that she is a Titan girl who is larger than him.<br/>
For their Attribute Values, they have excellent Vitality and Stamina, as well as Strength. However, they have poor Agility, Intelligence and Mana.<br/>
They have poor qualities for magic, and most only possess an affinity for a single attribute. This attribute is often the life attribute.<br/>
They possess the Augmented Muscular Strength and Augmented Stamina skills from birth, and it is easy for them to acquire each race’s resistance skills.<br/>
They have lifespans of around three hundred years; they age at the same pace as humans until they are around fifteen, and after that, their aging slows down, maintaining a physical age of someone in their twenties or thirties until they are around two hundred and fifty years old. After that, they begin aging rapidly. Because they age similarly to Dwarves, people have long wondered whether the two races are somehow related.<br/>
Many Titans have honest personalities and do not care about small details, but when they are angry, they are unmanageable. Also, they tend to prefer clothes that expose much of their skin. This is because Titans as a race believe that their bodies are beautiful things that they should be proud of. In fact, their sturdy, beautiful, well-proportioned bodies captivate those who behold them… though there have always been many women who dislike Titan men, saying that their muscles are unpleasant.<br/>
As adventurers, they are suited for being shield-bearers or powerful fighters who wield heavy weapons. However, parties made of only Titans sometimes do not have a shield-bearer at all. This is because there is no reason to become a shield-bearer if the entire party is sturdy.<br/>
As civilians, many Titans have occupations that require physical strength, such as farmers, miners and stonemasons.<br/>
Perhaps due to this, few Titans have high social positions. This is likely related to the fact that no nations made primarily of Titans have existed ever since Talosheim, a nation in the southern region of the Bahn Gaia continent, was destroyed two hundred years ago.<br/>
Although the Titans are not hostile to any races as a whole, there are more than a few who believe that the Amid Empire and its vassal nations that attacked the nation of the Titans are a common enemy of all Titans.<br/>
However, they hold disgust for the Hill Giants and Forest Giants, who are the descendants of the Colossi who joined the Demon King and became monsters in the age of myths, for defiling the bloodline of their great ancestors. Those who slay them are praised as worthy warriors.<br/>
In contrast, they worship the true Colossi, including Talos who maintained his divinity.<br/>
Their views on love are uninhibited and both men and women place an importance on strength and sturdiness, but they also admire those who have things like knowledge and a sense of art that they don’t possess themselves. They are also sometimes easily won over when they are treated with soft kindness and gracefulness.<br/>
It is said that there is a sub-race of Titans with white fur living in icy mountains and other cold regions of the Dark Continent, the continent that has become one enormous Devil’s Nest.<br/>
 <br/>
 <br/>
Beast-people<br/>
 <br/>
The races created when Vida mated with the beast-kings who served Ganpaplio, the beast-god who was destroyed by the Demon King.<br/>
Because there are multiple beast-king parents, beast-people can differ in appearance, but they generally all have the ears and tails of beasts. Each race has different features, such as fur growing on the backs of their hands and their shins or horns growing on their heads.<br/>
Their Attribute Values also differ depending on their parent beast-king. However, most races have poor qualities for magic while having excellent Vitality, Strength, Agility and Stamina.<br/>
There are only mammalian races of Beast-people, and Beast-person races of boars, horses and aquatic mammals do not exist. This is because in Lambda, reptilians are descendants of the subordinates of Marduke, the Dragon-emperor god.<br/>
There are no races of bird, horse or aquatic-mammalian Beast-people; this is explained by the fact that the beast-kings of those races were either destroyed by the Demon King, while some joined the evil gods, so the children born between them and the goddess became Harpies and Centaurs.<br/>
There are no boar Beast-people because the boar beast-king joined the Demon King and became the ancestor of the Orcs; this is also recorded in the myths. However, this incident is not often spoken of.<br/>
Incidentally, there are no Beast-people of domesticated animals such as dogs, cats, or pigs.<br/>
In the Status, Beast-people’s races are displayed as, “XX-type Beast-person.” Wolf Beast-people are displayed as “Wolf-type Beast-person,” while wildcat Beast-people are displayed as “Wildcat-type Beast-person.”<br/>
The skills that Beast-people possess from birth depend on what kind of Beast-people they are. However, most Beast-people possess the Dark Vision skill. Also, carnivorous Beast-people have fangs and claws, while herbivorous Beast-people have horns.<br/>
Within ten years, they grow to the equivalent of fifteen years in human age, and after that, they live until they are a hundred and fifty to two hundred years old. The speed of their aging is extraordinarily slow.<br/>
Also, children born between parents of different races of Beast-people are born as a Beast-person of one of the parents’ races. There are no cases of things like Beast-people with wildcat tails and a wolf’s tail.<br/>
However, such children can grow fangs and horns; there have been confirmed cases of things such as bear-type Beast-people with horns. Also, when using the Beast Transformation skill, which will be mentioned later, some of their parents’ physical features can appear.<br/>
These are not the limits of half-breeds that Beast-people can create; children can be born with pointed Elf ears and fox tails.<br/>
Their diets depend on what kind of Beast-people they are, but carnivorous Beast-people are not completely unable to eat food that isn’t meat, and likewise, even herbivorous Beast-people can eat meat.<br/>
As Adventurers, they are suited to being scouts or frontline fighters, and they tend to prefer being unarmed fighters using their claws and horns, or having roles that fight with light equipment. Also, they can gain skills such as Beast Transformation, a skill that turns them temporarily into half-beast half-human creatures, and acquire race-specific Jobs such as Beast Warrior.<br/>
Perhaps because they worship the beast-kings, there are some with a Job called ‘Shaman,’ which is a separate Job from the Priest Job.<br/>
Incidentally, unlike most Beast-people, fox-type, tanuki-type and goat-type Beast-people have qualities suited to magic, so many of them become mages.<br/>
They don’t have any inclinations to any specific occupations as civilians. They work in all kinds of areas.<br/>
In societal terms, they are the same as humans, but other than in the Birgitt Duchy in the Orbaume Kingdom, few Beast-people hold high-ranking positions in nations.<br/>
There are no races that Beast-men are hostile towards as a race, but they truly detest those who speak ill of the pride of their kind. It is not uncommon for people to be challenged to duels to the death over wolf-type Beast-people being called Kobolds and buffalo-type Beast-people being called Minotaurs.<br/>
They have all kinds of views on love and marriage; when members of a single race are all gathered together and living in the same place, they can have monogamy, polygamy or no marriage system at all, depending on the race. The thing that they have in common is that the husbands act important while it is actually the wives that hold authority in the household. But in important situations, the husband’s opinions take priority.<br/>
When they live in villages and cities, they use the systems of those villages and cities.<br/>
Also, for Beast-people, love equals marriage; creating children is the basis of it. The criteria for loving someone is whether one wants to make children with them or not.<br/>
Thus, adult relations are not desirable.<br/>
Incidentally, Beast-people have certain periods where they want to leave offspring behind, which vary depending on their race. They can still create children outside of these periods, but things are rather plain when doing so.<br/>
It is not an insult to make fun of this as being a mating season for the Beast-people, but one should be prepared to receive a comeback of, “Well, your people mate all year round.”<br/>
 <br/>
 <br/>
Ghouls<br/>
 <br/>
The general public believes that Ghouls are a special race of Undead. Though even many Ghouls themselves do not know this, they are a race descended from the younger of the twins, whose genders are unknown, born to Vida and the Undead champion Zakkart.<br/>
There are no remaining records of Ghouls in the myths, so it seems that their ancestor was completely uninvolved in the later battle between Alda and Vida, but it is unknown whether they distanced themselves from the battle on their own or were allowed to escape.<br/>
Ghouls, both men and women, have gray-brown skin, but the women look exactly like beautiful human women except for their yellow pupils and claws. In contrast, the men have the heads of lions and arms so long that the backs of their hands reach the ground when they are standing upright.<br/>
Ghoul men and women differ in their qualities as much as in their appearances; the men are physically superior but have poor qualities for magic, while women are physically inferior to men but possess good qualities for magic.<br/>
Their lifespans are around three hundred years; the men age at the same pace as humans until the age of fifteen and then begin aging slowly after reaching adulthood. Women grow and age at the same pace as humans until they become pregnant (even if they do not have a successful childbirth), and once they become pregnant, their physical age becomes fixed.<br/>
Ghouls possess the Dark Vision, Superhuman Strength, Pain Resistance and Venom Secretion skills from birth; their claws that secrete paralyzing venom, become fearsome weapons when swung with their powerful arms.<br/>
They are vulgar and unsociable in nature, but their sense of unity as a race is strong; in times of emergency, they put their differences aside to cooperate with other tribes and villages. Also, it is possible for members of another race of Vida to make exchanges that are civil to a certain extent with tribes that are aware that Ghouls are a race of Vida.<br/>
Also, for a later-mentioned reason, villages that are in trouble may willingly welcome members of other races.<br/>
As there are no nations that treat Ghouls as people, they cannot become adventurers, but they live their lives while setting their roles based on their gender, so even in battle, men are often at the front while women are at the back.<br/>
There are no Ghoul civilians. One could make a far-fetched argument that Ghouls captured and traded as slaves, or tamed specimens, could be considered civilians.<br/>
Because they live like aboriginals in Devil’s Nests, they are thought of as a race of monsters, but they live like this because their reproduction capability is low; they cannot produce offspring outside Devil’s Nests.<br/>
This is why Ghouls have no concept of marriage, and it is ordinary for them to do everything they can to produce offspring. It seems that there are cases where strong individuals monopolize members of the other sex, but these are rare cases.<br/>
For their diets, they prefer meat and even use human meat as food. For this reason, they are called corpse-eating demons, but the Ghouls would argue that humans take materials from their corpses as well.<br/>
It could be said that they are hostile to every other race. Also, it seems that some have complexes when it comes to Vampires.<br/>
Ghouls can conduct a ritual to transform human, Elf or Dwarf women into Ghouls. As their lack of fertility is a serious problem, when their female numbers drop too low for whatever reason, they sometimes turn female adventurers and such that they capture into Ghouls.<br/>
When they capture male adventurers, if they are lucky, they might be able to survive by nodding their heads to the advances of Ghoul women.<br/>
Note!<br/>
Much of the above does not apply to the Ghouls of Talosheim.<br/>
 <br/>
 <br/>
Vampires<br/>
 <br/>
The race descended from the older of the twins, whose genders are unknown, born to Vida and the Undead champion Zakkart. Within the race, they are divided into Pure-breed Vampires, Noble-born Vampires and Subordinate Vampires.<br/>
Their appearances are mostly the same as the races they originally were, such as humans, Elves and Dwarves, but their pupils are crimson and they possess long fangs.<br/>
They are generally regarded not as people but monsters, beings that oppose the gods. In human society, they are targets to be exterminated. But they have spread their roots in the underworld, and there are many examples in the past of clergymen loudly advocating for Vampire extermination while actually being spies for the Vampires.<br/>
Pure-breed Vampires, Noble-born Vampires and Subordinate Vampires all have no lifespans; they are ageless. The moment they become Vampires, their aging stops.<br/>
From the moment they become Vampires, they acquire the Superhuman Strength, Dark Vision, Bloodsucking, Rapid Regeneration and Status Effect Resistance skills, but they become critically weak to sunlight and silver.<br/>
It is said that the likely explanation for the Vampires being weak to sunlight is that their very existence angers Alda, who rules over light.<br/>
Their weakness to silver is explained by the fact that Undead have always been weak against silver, and this weakness has been inherited by Vampires, who descended from the Undead Zakkart.<br/>
Many Vampires have pompous personalities, treating races with short lifespans with arrogance. Many of them are cunning, cruel, ruthless and inhuman.<br/>
However, this is because many of the currently-existing Vampires worship the evil gods who are the remnants of the Demon King’s army; this is not the case for the Vampires who still worship Vida… In fact, virtuous Vampires are seen from time to time.<br/>
Details of Pure-breed Vampires are unknown as they are beings that even legends are unworthy of speaking of them; they are mythical beings. However, Noble-born Vampires excel in all Attribute Values and they are able to fly. Normal people do not stand a chance against even the most inexperienced Noble-born Vampires.<br/>
Subordinate Vampires have dramatically increased Strength, Agility, Stamina and Vitality (Even if they were originally frail children, they are capable of having frontal fist-fights against bears). However, their qualities when it comes to magic does not change from before they become Vampires.<br/>
There are no Vampire civilians, but they do not lose the skills that they possessed before becoming Vampires, so they can carry out their lives in human society as long as they are not exposed to sunlight.<br/>
Also, because they are ageless, Vampires who have spent long years and months improving themselves diligently are more fearsome than Dragons.<br/>
Vampires enjoy sucking the blood of others, but they can also consume normal food. However, if they go long periods without ingesting blood, their health deteriorates and it is said that they eventually die. However, it seems that monster or animal blood is sufficient for them to maintain themselves, so there are almost no cases where a Vampire has actually died from this.<br/>
It is said that they like the fresh blood of virgins, but their preferences vary from individual to individual, and in the past, there have even been Vampires who prefer the blood of middle-aged men who smoke tobacco… According to them, the bitterness in the blood becomes addictive.<br/>
Vampires increase their population by giving their own blood to members of other races… humans, elves and dwarves, in order to transform them into Vampires. Pure-breed Vampires and Noble-born Vampires are capable of creating other Noble-born Vampires or Subordinate Vampires, while Subordinate Vampires generally cannot turn others into Vampires.<br/>
Perhaps for this reason, those who become Vampires experience a decline in their sexual desire, which is replaced by a desire to suck blood. However, it does not disappear completely, so Dhampirs, half-breeds created with other races, are seen from time to time.<br/>
However, it is difficult to imagine that this mode of life is what Vida wanted for the Vampire race that she created. In fact, it is possible for Vampires to leave offspring behind in the same way as any other living creature.<br/>
Given this fact, Vida’s believers insist that Vida wanted to add something more to the Vampires, of which only the Vampire founder and the Pure-breed Vampires existed at the time, but before she could, she was defeated by Alda, the god of law and fate, and the champion Bellwood.<br/>
Incidentally, the Vampire transformation ritual is possible for members of Vida’s other races, but the side effects are so drastic that it apparently only succeeds for one in ten individuals.<br/>
