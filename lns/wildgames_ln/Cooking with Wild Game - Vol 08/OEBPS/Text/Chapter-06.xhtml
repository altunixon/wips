      <p>Blue month 27th.</p>

      <p>On this day, the Wu clan village was scheduled to hold a harvest festival.</p>

      <p>At the same time, our third stall lease term in the Post Station Town would end.</p>

      <p>After closing the stall, we headed to the 《Kimyusu’s Tail Inn》 as usual to return the cart, and I thanked the innkeeper Milano Mast:</p>

      <p>「Milano Mast, I have been in your care… Sorry, but can you continue renting us the carts from tomorrow onwards?」</p>

      <p>「I’m a businessman too; since you made a request, I have no reason to reject you.」</p>

      <p>Milano Mast was checking the cart for damages and had a sour face as usual.</p>

      <p>「You will continue working in the 《Big Tree of the South Inn》, correct? You can just rent a cart from them and save the hassle of running all over the place.」</p>

      <p>「No, it’s no hassle at all. If it isn’t too much trouble, I will want to continue the stall lease with your inn.」</p>

      <p>I was a bit worried.</p>

      <p>「The space rental and cart leasing fee aren’t much, right? How should I put this, I feel bad about all the trouble we caused you… Will it jeopardize your position if you continue to work with us?」</p>

      <p>「What a naggy fellow, how much longer are you going to pester? I already told you plenty of times, that I would have thrown the lot of you out if you caused me any trouble.」</p>

      <p>Milano Mast turned to me after finishing his inspection and looked even more uneasy.</p>

      <p>After that big incident with the Tsun clan, I didn’t sense much difference from Leito or Milano Mast. But Milano Mast’s eyes seemed less sharp nowadays and he spoke with us more often. Even such a minute change filled me with glee.</p>

      <p>Speaking of which, it had been ten days since that commotion.</p>

      <p>I couldn’t help feeling surprised.</p>

      <p>The meeting between us and the castle people getting postponed to 30th of the Blue month might have played a part, but these ten days had been smooth sailing. Even though the Post Station Town residents still had reservations towards the denizens of Forest’s Edge, and most of them looked at us with probing or dubious gazes, everything appeared peaceful on the surface.</p>

      <p>The sales at the stall were stable, with about 140 portions sold every day, while the meals catered to the inn were all sold out. Could such a peaceful life continue… That would depend on the result of the meeting three days later.</p>

      <p>「Enough about that for now. You are not taking a day off, and continuing tomorrow too? Normally, everyone will rest for a day at the end of the lease. You are not worried about money, right?」</p>

      <p>Milano Mast crossed his muscular arms before his chest as he asked.</p>

      <p>Money wasn’t an issue for us, of course. After setting up the stall for 30 days, our profits were 5,484 red copper plates.</p>

      <p>5,484 red copper plates… That was roughly 457 kiba worth of tusks and horns.</p>

      <p>Including the living expenses of the Fa house, we spent less than one hundred red copper plates a month. After buying the griddle, the kitchen knife, &#160;and the necklace for my house head, we didn’t buy any other big-ticket items. The expensive ingredients, Tau sauce and cheese, were just ten to twenty red copper plates.</p>

      <p>I would be collecting the wagon I ordered tomorrow. Costing 1,200 red copper plates, this was the most expensive items I had purchased so far. After deducting that, we still had 3,700 red copper plates on hand. We didn’t need to worry about food or clothing now and were troubled by how best to utilize this money instead.</p>

      <p>Even though my wallet was full, there was a reason why I didn’t want to rest.</p>

      <p>「To be honest, my regular patrons from the east and the south are about to leave Genos. So I don’t plan to take a day off before they leave.」</p>

      <p>「The easterners and southerners, huh… By the way, I heard that you are selling food to an inn frequented by easterners too?」</p>

      <p>「Yes. That inn is called the 《Cryptic Venerable Inn》. The innkeeper is Neil.」</p>

      <p>「Ah, the inn run by that weirdo influenced by the eastern kingdom.」</p>

      <p>Milano Mast kept quiet after saying that.</p>

      <p>He looked troubled for some reason.</p>

      <p>Did he not get along with Neil from the 《Cryptic Venerable Inn》? I felt a little worried about his reaction. But his mind seemed preoccupied with other thoughts.</p>

      <p>「… May I know if there is anything wrong?」</p>

      <p>Milano Mast seemed to realize something and glared at me with simmering eyes once again.</p>

      <p>「It’s nothing! Since the things are settled, go away. I have work to do.」</p>

      <p>「Sorry. I will be in your care from tomorrow onwards too.」</p>

      <p>He seemed to have something else in mind, but Milano Mast already went inside his warehouse, so I had to let the matter rest.</p>

      <p>With the griddle, pot, ingredients and four women: Vena Wu, Shela Wu, Lala Wu, and Rii Sudora, we walked towards the entrance of the inn. At this moment, Kamyua Yost blocked the way leading outside.</p>

      <p>「Hi, thank you for your hard work, Asuta. I appreciate the delicious lunch.」</p>

      <p>「Ah, thank you. It’s been a while since we last met.」</p>

      <p>The last time I saw him was the day the Totos incident ended. It has been three days since then, although Leito did help him buy lunch at noon every day.</p>

      <p>Kamyua Yost stood before us whimsically and showed his usual cheery smile.</p>

      <p>「If possible, I want to eat your food while it’s hot, but I had been busy preparing for that meeting and opening communication channels. Malfreed can’t leave this city so easily because of his status, so I had to run around in his stead.」</p>

      <p>Running around and opening channels for the sake of the meeting.</p>

      <p>The one who requested postponing the meeting was Malfreed, not Pyschkurewuss. It seemed that they were doing some covert operations again.</p>

      <p>「That must be tough. I hope opening all these channels isn’t a scheme against the denizens of Forest’s Edge.」</p>

      <p>Kamyua Yost spread his arms in surprise.</p>

      <p>「But why would we scheme against the denizens of Forest’s Edge? Our goal is to expose the Pyschkurewuss’ past crimes?」</p>

      <p>「Sorry, the last part is just a joke. I had been showing my dark side unreservedly when talking to you. I will reflect on my actions.」</p>

      <p>「No; if that is your nature, I will be happy to see that change in you.」</p>

      <p>Kamyua Yost ruffled his blonde hair.</p>

      <p>「Never mind, Asuta, I have something to ask you… Is dinner in the 《Cryptic Venerable Inn》 tonight grilled meat or hotpot?」</p>

      <p>「What? It’s hotpot tonight.」</p>

      <p>What about it?</p>

      <p>「I see, thanks. I will have dinner at the 《Cryptic Venerable Inn》 tonight. If they served the same dish every day, I would just need to take turns visiting the 《Cryptic Venerable Inn》 and 《Big Tree of the South Inn》 for dinner. But now, I have to worry about this every day.」</p>

      <p>「Ehh? You have your dinner at the 《Cryptic Venerable Inn》 and 《Big Tree of the South Inn》? Don’t you stay in the 《Kimyusu’s Tail Inn》?」</p>

      <p>「Yes, but I can eat western dishes everywhere else, so I want to eat your kiba dish while I’m in Genos.」</p>

      <p>Kamyua Yost smiled cheerfully again.</p>

      <p>「There are many like me too. The 《Cryptic Venerable Inn》 and 《Big Tree of the South Inn》 are crowded during dinner hours. There are many westerners there too, and not all of them lodge in that inn. I even saw a few easterners at the 《Big Tree of the South Inn》 yesterday.」</p>

      <p>「Thank you for your patronage… But you are a regular in the 《Kimyusu’s Tail Inn》, right? Won’t that cause friction between you and Milano Mast?」</p>

      <p>「The customers have the right to decide where to eat dinner. Milano Mast is not a petty man; he won’t get angry over such trivial matters… It’s not good to say this, but the dinner quality in the 《Kimyusu’s Tail Inn》 isn’t high. As you know, Milano Mast lost his wife when he was young, and his daughter didn’t have the chance to learn to cook. Even if the other inns didn’t provide kiba dishes, I would still eat elsewhere.」</p>

      <p>「… Kamyua Yost, I’m still not as mean as you.」</p>

      <p>I didn’t understand how he could joke about Milano Mast’s circumstances so lightly. Furthermore, Milano Mast’s wife died young because of the Tsun clan’s treachery.</p>

      <p>「And so? Are you trying to coerce me into catering for the 《Kimyusu’s Tail Inn》 and teach Milano Mast or his daughter to cook too?」</p>

      <p>「I have no intention of coercing you. But if I can eat kiba dishes at this inn, I won’t need to make a trip to another inn, which will be less of a hassle.」</p>

      <p>「… I still don’t know if the denizens of Forest’s Edge can form a cordial relationship with the people in the Genos castle, so I can’t drag Milano Mast in recklessly.」</p>

      <p>「Then it’s fine to drag in the 《Cryptic Venerable Inn》 and 《Big Tree of the South Inn》?」</p>

      <p>「Their circumstances are different from Milano Mast. Milano Mast is related to that incident a decade ago.」</p>

      <p>I tried to cool down my head that was almost boiling and continued:</p>

      <p>「I really want to repay Milano Mast’s kindness, but this will have to wait after the meeting in three days ends… I don’t think you are that vicious, but you won’t endanger Milano Mast for the sake of forcing Pyschkurewuss into a corner, right?」</p>

      <p>「Do I look that cold and heartless? I set my sights on Pyschkurewuss and the Tsun clan for the sake of avenging Milano Mast and Leito in the first place, so I won’t get my priorities wrong… Don’t tell anyone, but there are three 《guardians》 lodging in the 《Kimyusu’s Tail Inn》. I did everything I could to stop Pyschkurewuss from reaching his claws here.」</p>

      <p>「Tell me the important details before you joke next time. Will Milano Mast be in any danger? Should I sign my contract with the 《Big Tree of the South Inn》 instead?」</p>

      <p>「No, Pyschkurewuss won’t target Milano Mast. Milano Mast might be related to that incident a decade ago, but the hunter’s necklace clutched in the hand of his brother-in-law had already been submitted to the guards as evidence… By the way, if Milano Mast had any value as a witness, Malfreed would already have convicted the Tsun clan and Pyschkurewuss of their crimes.」</p>

      <p>「In that case, why did you ask the 《guardians》 to guard him? If there isn’t any danger, you don’t need to be so cautious, right?」</p>

      <p>「I’m just covering all the bases. If anything happens to Milano Mast, even I won’t be able to smile so cheerfully.」</p>

      <p>Kamyua Yost still had the pretentious smile on his face, but the light in his purple eyes was wavering as he tried to conceal his emotions.</p>

      <p>「Don’t worry, just do whatever you wish. If I can eat kiba dishes in the 《Kimyusu’s Tail Inn》, I will be overjoyed, you know?」</p>

      <p>「You are only asking for your own convenience, right? Besides, Milano Mast won’t be interested in learning to cook from someone like me.」</p>

      <p>「Who knows? Going by his stubborn character, even if he harbors such thoughts, he won’t mention it to you proactively.」</p>

      <p>After hearing him say that, I felt more worried about Milano Mast’s silence just now. Milano seemed to be suppressing his emotions back then.</p>

      <p>I sighed softly and shifted my gaze towards Kamyua Yost’s whimsical eyes.</p>

      <p>「Anyway, this will have to wait after the meeting ends smoothly three days later. No matter what, I can’t take on any more jobs before the end of the Blue month.」</p>

      <p>「Alright, alright. I will do my small part to guide things towards a better ending… Ah, can you keep that thing regarding the 《guardians》 a secret? If Milano Mast learns about it, he might think I’m meddling too much and chase them all out.」</p>

      <p>Kamyua Yost didn’t reveal any other emotions and kept smiling as usual.</p>

      <hr/>

      <p>「Ah, really now! You always talk so long, it’s already so late now!」</p>

      <p>As we walked along a small path flanked by trees inside Forest’s Edge, Lala Wu complained angrily.</p>

      <p>I watched her red ponytail sway like the tail of a horse and answered: 「Don’t we usually return at this time too?」</p>

      <p>「It’s fine if there is nothing else going on, but today is the harvest festival! The men from the kin houses should have gathered by now and started their test of might!」</p>

      <p>「Ehh? The festival is already starting when the day is still so bright?」</p>

      <p>「The feast will only start at dusk! How can we eat before the hunters finish their competition!? I can’t even, you don’t know anything!」</p>

      <p>It was true that I didn’t know anything about the harvest festival. Only the bigger houses could host a harvest festival, so I didn’t learn much even after asking Ai Fa about it.</p>

      <p>Never mind, Donda Wu only asked me to prepare dinner for the winner of the contest, everything else didn’t concern me. By the way, why was Lala Wu so anxious to return to her village?</p>

      <p>「… For men, the test of might during a harvest festival is an important moment. For the unwed women, this is an important ceremony to choose a husband…」</p>

      <p>Vena Wu whispered to me as she carried a large sack of food.</p>

      <p>Her answer didn’t dispel my doubts.</p>

      <p>「Lala Wu is just thirteen and can’t marry yet, right? This should have nothing to do with her.」</p>

      <p>「I’m not too sure… Maybe there is a boy that she likes…?」</p>

      <p>If there was someone that Lala Wu liked, she probably would want to witness his important moment.</p>

      <p>At this point, I finally figured it out. I was really dense.</p>

      <p>「Just to confirm, as a hearth caretaker, I won’t be dragged into the contest, correct?」</p>

      <p>「Hmm…? Since we invited you to the festival, you probably can join in if you want to…」</p>

      <p>「Definitely not.」</p>

      <p>There wasn’t even a one in a million chance for me to win against a man from Forest’s Edge. No matter what competition it was, I could only compete with Leina Wu or Lala Wu at the most. To be honest, I might be weaker than Vena Wu.</p>

      <p>「Enough about that, Asuta… Do you not get along with that man…?」</p>

      <p>「Huh? You mean Kamyua Yost? Not really.」</p>

      <p>「Is that so…? But you looked angry just now…」</p>

      <p>I thought I showed my poker face back then, but Vena Wu saw right through me.</p>

      <p>「It’s really nothing, he said something that made me a little unhappy. When I’m facing that Kamyua who loves pretending to be retarded, I will try to be honest and not hide my thoughts and feelings. Or else, it will be hard to make him do the same.」</p>

      <p>「Really… What a pain…」</p>

      <p>Vena Wu seemed uninterested as she shrugged sexily.</p>

      <p>After walking for 40 to 50 minutes along the steep slope, we returned to the Forest’s Edge.</p>

      <p>Following the widening path that led to the north, we saw the Wu clan village in no time. We bade Rii Sudora farewell at a short distance from the Wu clan village, took over the ingredients she was carrying for us, and stepped into the plaza that was rowdier than usual…</p>

      <p>I was stunned.</p>

      <p>The Wu clan village was more crowded than I imagined. Of the one hundred Wu clan kins members, more than half of them were gathered here.</p>

      <p>Most of them were young, with equal parts of both genders. There were almost no signs of the elderly and children. People formed a wall around the plaza and kept cheering… At this moment, a large man was in an intense battle with Ai Fa in the middle of the crowd.</p>

      <p>「A-Ai Fa, what are you doing!」</p>

      <p>Cheers from the crowd drowned out my shout. The youth from the Wu clan were hyped from their battle and cheering loudly.</p>

      <p>Ai Fa and her opponent were both unarmed. They didn’t have any blades on their waist or cape on their shoulders. This made Ai Fa’s situation look very dire.</p>

      <p>Ai Fa’s opponent was a hulk as tall as Mida. Standing over two meters tall and weighing more than a hundred kg, he had long limbs and a thick chest and was built like a bull. This imposing giant was reaching out his long arms in an attempt to grab Ai Fa.</p>

      <p>Ai Fa possessed extraordinary physical abilities so she wouldn’t be caught so easily. She just kept jumping left and right to evade that man’s fingertips, showing no intention to strike back. Ai Fa might be skilled, but the size difference between them was too big; it was reckless of her to duel with such a man without any weapons.</p>

      <p>「What is going on!? Why isn’t anyone stopping this commotion!?」</p>

      <p>「Ehh… But we can’t interfere with a hunter’s contest of might…」</p>

      <p>Vena Wu looked at me in surprise.</p>

      <p>「Contest of might? This is a contest of might? Isn’t this just a brawl? Besides, why is Ai Fa competing!?」</p>

      <p>「How would I know… Don’t worry, hurting the opponent is a taboo…」</p>

      <p>Hurting the opponent is a taboo?</p>

      <p>The hulk continued waving his bear-like arms in pursuit of Ai Fa. Just one swipe would shatter bones.</p>

      <p>「I can’t watch any longer! I will stop them!」</p>

      <p>「Ahh, you can’t…」</p>

      <p>Vena Wu was about to stop me when a cheer loud enough to shake the forest erupted.</p>

      <p>I hurriedly shifted my gaze towards the two contestants; the griddle in my hand was almost falling off. Ai Fa who was backpedaling got tripped by a pothole and fell.</p>

      <p>The hulk immediately closed in.</p>

      <p>It was over.</p>

      <p>Compared to that man, Ai Fa was so thin and fragile. I could imagine Ai Fa being sent flying and almost cried out in despair.</p>

      <p>However… the off-balanced Ai Fa didn’t try to right herself up and kicked her right leg high instead.</p>

      <p>When the hulk drew near, her toes touched his shoulder.</p>

      <p>Ai Fa used the momentum of the hulk to jump further backward.</p>

      <p>She wasn’t just jumping, she turned backward in midair, touched the ground with her right palm momentarily, and did a backflip— before landing perfectly.</p>

      <p>The cheers were so loud that it shook the very air.</p>

      <p>The hulk roared and smashed at Ai Fa with his head.</p>

      <p>He closed the 7 to 8 meters gap in an instant.</p>

      <p>He was about to grab Ai Fa.</p>

      <p>Before his thick fingers reached Ai Fa’s breasts, Ai Fa suddenly vanished.</p>

      <p>She had lowered her entire body.</p>

      <p>While doing so, Ai Fa extended her right leg to her side and swung it backward. This was like the leg sweep often seen in kung-fu movies.</p>

      <p>Ai Fa’s right leg kicked the hulk’s right ankle, making him fall backward.</p>

      <p>She then stood up quickly, while that man hurriedly propped up his upper body.</p>

      <p>「The match is over!」</p>

      <p>At the same time, a sharp voice cut through the heated atmosphere.</p>

      <p>「Winner, Ai Fa of the Fa house. Jii Mamu of the Mamu house, please leave the arena.」</p>

      <p>Claps and cheers overwhelmed the stern voice.</p>

      <p>The hulk roared with rage as he smashed his fists onto the ground.</p>

      <p>「Amazing! She beat up Jii Mamu! Jii Mamu is a brave who can fight Darum-nii on equal footing!」</p>

      <p>Lala Wu squealed excitedly.</p>

      <p>I almost collapsed onto the ground with the griddle in my arms but somehow found my footing.</p>

      <p>And then, Ai Fa walked towards us with thunderous applause.</p>

      <p>「You are finally back. Asuta, why are you so late?」</p>

      <p>「I-I’m not late at all! What were you doing!?」</p>

      <p>「Why are you so loud? It’s a contest of might.」</p>

      <p>Even though she had just been through an intense match, Ai Fa didn’t break a sweat.</p>

      <p>「I had never heard of harvest festivals, but I’m familiar with the contest of might since I was young. Compared to my father Gill, that man wasn’t much at all.」</p>

      <p>「Even so, you shouldn’t act so dangerously, right? We are the guests of the Wu clan here!」</p>

      <p>「I didn’t intend to contest, but since he challenged me, I had a match with him.」</p>

      <p>When Ai Fa was about to pout unhappily, she seemed to notice the gaze of Lala Wu and the others and kept a straight face.</p>

      <p>「Ai Fa, I’m really surprised that you defeated Jii Mamu. You are a really capable hunter.」</p>

      <p>Shela Wu who was carrying a pot together with Lala Wu mediated between for us.</p>

      <p>「Asuta, the test of might between hunters is also called Battle of Skill. The rules forbid harming the opponent. The hunters can’t use weapons, and have to win by using strength and skills to overcome their opponent, forcing their body to touch the ground… I don’t like seeing the violent side of men either, but the Battle of Skill is not a dangerous brawl.」</p>

      <p>Shela Wu’s voice was calm and steady and had the effect of soothing one’s heart.</p>

      <p>The unease in my heart caused me to admonish Ai Fa. I reflected on my actions and scratched my head.</p>

      <p>「That was my bad, I shouldn’t have yelled at you so suddenly… You will be helping me later, right? Or do you prefer to participate in this Battle of Skill?」</p>

      <p>「I already told you that I didn’t join this competition willingly. That Jii Mamu said that a woman shouldn’t be a hunter and challenged me to a contest. Since he went that far, I couldn’t back down either and showed him my prowess as a hunter.」</p>

      <p>Ai Fa shrugged.</p>

      <p>「I will help tend to the hearth as promised. The kiba I carried over from our home is hanging right there.」</p>

      <p>「Ehh? Did you hunt a kiba today too? That’s two days in a row.」</p>

      <p>「When your luck comes, you can hunt as many as you want. And I didn’t use 『Sacrificial hunting method』.」</p>

      <p>Ai Fa declared pre-emptively.</p>

      <p>After her wounds recovered, her body was in top condition. Seeing how dependable my house head was, I couldn’t help but sigh.</p>

      <p>「I understand, thank you. Well then, let’s start the preparations.」</p>

      <p>「Yes.」</p>

      <p>Ai Fa nodded seriously and then leaned her face towards mine. In order to keep Vena Wu and the others from seeing her face, she subtly adjusted the position she was standing in.</p>

      <p>「Asuta, you really are a worrywart, a man of that level can’t best me.」</p>

      <p>「That’s true…」</p>

      <p>「No need to explain. You are worried about me, and I don’t blame you for that. It’s been a long time since I had a contest of might, so I felt like enjoying myself and didn’t turn him down… Please, forgive me.」</p>

      <p>Ai Fa showed her white teeth with a smile from close up.</p>

      <p>After seeing her smile, who would be able to pick any fault with her? I sighed again.</p>

    <section epub:type="subchapter">
      <h3 id="sigil_toc_id_15">2</h3>

      <p>We were assigned to the stove room in the Shin Wu’s house today.</p>

      <p>Donda Wu only asked me to prepare the meat dish for the winner of the competition, so that wasn’t an issue. Everyone else should be preparing dinner in the stove room of the other houses, under the direction of Mia Lei Wu.</p>

      <p>Including the men participating in the competition and the women watching them, there were 70-odd people gathered here. That was how grand the harvest festival was.</p>

      <p>With the sun high in the sky, the Wu clan village was like a simmering cauldron. After Ai Fa’s match with Jii Mamu was over, the hunters continued comparing their strength and skills in the center of the plaza. We looked at the wall of people surrounding the hunters and walked toward the Shin Wu house.</p>

      <p>「Ah, Shin Wu! What are you doing here?」</p>

      <p>Lala Wu said excitedly. Shin Wu and his house member Mida were sitting side by side at the entrance.</p>

      <p>Shin Wu looked up at Lala Wu. He seemed a little down as he sat beside the panting Mida.</p>

      <p>「I’m not doing anything. This is my house, so it’s not strange for me to be here.」</p>

      <p>「I’m not asking about that… Did you lose already?」</p>

      <p>「Yes. I still can’t win against Ludo Wu.」</p>

      <p>「How retarded! Why are you always challenging the same person? Despite how Ludo looks, he is one of the top hunters amongst our kins! You can definitely win easily if you pick another opponent.」</p>

      <p>It seemed that the contest used a knock out system. In that case, Ai Fa would be obligated to participate in the next round of battle too. I was a little worried.</p>

      <p>However, the main characters right now were Lala Wu and Shin Wu.</p>

      <p>「… I haven’t won against Ludo Wu yet, so there’s no point in challenging others.」</p>

      <p>「It can’t be helped then. But can you not be so depressed?」</p>

      <p>「I’m not depressed.」</p>

      <p>「Yes, you are! There is glory in winning the test of might, but there is no shame in losing too! So just keep your head up and enjoy the festival!」</p>

      <p>After Shin Wu turned dumbfounded because of Lala Wu’s words, he glanced at Mida.</p>

      <p>「What about you? It looks like you entered the match too, right?」</p>

      <p>「Yes… Mida worked hard too…」</p>

      <p>The sweaty Mida looked towards me with ragged breath.</p>

      <p>「Asuta… If Mida wins all the test of might contests, Mida can taste your cooking, right…?」</p>

      <p>「Yes, that is the plan.」</p>

      <p>「Mida is working hard… Mida can eat your cooking after winning four more people…」</p>

      <p>「Ehh? You already won against two people? Amazing!」</p>

      <p>Instead of admiration, Lala Wu appeared more surprised.</p>

      <p>I didn’t really know the rules of the contest. After asking Lala Wu, I learned that the hunters had to fight many rounds. After winning the three preliminary rounds, the winner of the actual tournament will be crowned champion. The preliminary rounds were a random round robin affair, the first eight hunters who win three matches would qualify for the main tournament. Hunters who lost twice would be knocked out, so this was a survival competition where the ones who won three matches first could progress to the next stage. The tournament utilized a single match knockout system, and the person who won three matches would be champion. The preliminary matches might seem haphazard, but this was a system to pick the eight elites from the pool of 30 to 40 contestants.</p>

      <p>By the way, Donda Wu and Dan Lutim already defeated three people. It was the nature of the denizens of Forest’s Edge to challenge the strong right from the start.</p>

      <p>Jiza Wu, Ludo Wu, Kaslan Lutim, and the other strong contestants also won two rounds. Lala Wu was surprised that Mida was on par with these elites.</p>

      <p>「If you keep winning, you will need to defeat Papa Donda and Dan Lutim. That’s not an easy feat, so work hard.」</p>

      <p>「Yes… Mida will work hard…」</p>

      <p>Mida’s cheeks kept trembling.</p>

      <p>Lala Wu nodded at Mida and then turned towards Shin Wu.</p>

      <p>「And so? Have you given up? You just need to win three matches to become an elite eight, you know?」</p>

      <p>「I didn’t give up, I’m just charging up my power.」</p>

      <p>I didn’t know if he was telling the truth, but he stood up with determination.</p>

      <p>「The others should have won their second match by now. I should go now so that I won’t fall behind.」</p>

      <p>「Yes! Do your best!」</p>

      <p>Lala Wu showed a satisfied smile.</p>

      <p>But after Shin Wu left, she lowered her gaze a little worriedly. Thinking that I should make up for my dense reaction earlier, I said nonchalantly:</p>

      <p>「Well then, let’s watch Shin Wu strut his stuff. There is still time anyway.」</p>

      <p>「Huh?」</p>

      <p>Lala Wu looked at me with her eyes wide open.</p>

      <p>「Can we afford to take things so easily? Don’t you have to prepare the food for tomorrow’s business too?」</p>

      <p>「You will be helping me later, right? Then I can finish it up easily.」</p>

      <p>「You are too relaxed! If you serve any weird dish, Papa Donda will throw you out, you know?」</p>

      <p>Despite Lala Wu’s words, her eyes were sparkling.</p>

      <p>And so, we put the luggage we were carrying onto the floor and walked towards the human wall. At this moment, a tall figure blocked our path.</p>

      <p>It was a lean youth who was half a head taller than me. This wild wolf-like youth was the second son of the Wu clan main house, Darum Wu.</p>

      <p>「Ah, Darum-nii! When did you come back!? Thank you for the flower you gave me earlier!」</p>

      <p>「Don’t mention it. The members of the Jean house will be surveilling the Tsun clan village, so I can finally come back.」</p>

      <p>Darum Wu said to the rowdy Lala Wu and nodded to the quietly smiling Vena Wu, and then shifted his sharp gaze towards me… specifically speaking, to Ai Fa beside me.</p>

      <p>「Head of the Fa house, Ai Fa, I challenge you to the test of might.」</p>

      <p>「Hmm?… Sorry, I have to help tend to the hearth. Besides, I’m not a kin of the Wu clan, so I shouldn’t act too arrogantly here.」</p>

      <p>「Are you going to ignore my challenge and run? Instead of showing your prowess as a hunter, are you placing more priority on working at the hearth? In that case, stop calling yourself a hunter and just tend to your hearth.」</p>

      <p>Darum Wu said in a low voice and then walked towards us.</p>

      <p>A deep scar went right across his right cheek, and his serious face leaned right into Ai Fa’s ears.</p>

      <p>「If you win, I swear that I will acknowledge you as a hunter and won’t mock you ever again… If I win, you have to join the Wu clan.」</p>

      <p>As I was standing right beside Ai Fa, I was probably the only other person who heard that.</p>

      <p>Ai Fa glared at Darum Wu from close range and then answered in a suppressed tone:</p>

      <p>「What will happen to Asuta then?」</p>

      <p>「If you wish to, I can persuade my dad and let that hearth caretaker join the Wu clan too. You won’t have any complains now, right?」</p>

      <p>Under the troubled gaze of his elder sister and a puzzled look of his younger sister, Darum Wu quickly left Ai Fa’s side.</p>

      <p>「If you possess the honor of a hunter, accept my challenge. If you flee, I will never see you as a hunter.」</p>

      <p>Darum Wu walked towards the center of the plaza.</p>

      <p>Ai Fa sighed softly, and I grabbed her arm when she was about to stride forth.</p>

      <p>「Hey, are you going to agree with his one-sided proposal?」</p>

      <p>「Since he questioned my honor as a hunter, I can’t run away… That second son must have resolved himself when he said that.」</p>

      <p>「Even so…」</p>

      <p>「Besides, the Wu clan is now the tribal chief clan of the Forest’s Edge. If we don’t form proper bonds with them, it might affect other people around us too. I think this is a good chance to improve my relationship with the second son.」</p>

      <p>Ai Fa’s eyes were calm and steady, and the light of determination shone from the depths of her eyes.</p>

      <p>「My relationships with the head, the eldest son, and the second son of the Wu clan main house aren’t too good. But thanks to your efforts, the clan head Donda Wu has eased up a lot. That’s why I want to form proper bonds with the second son.」</p>

      <p>Ai Fa showed a strong and quiet smile.</p>

      <p>And then… I wasn’t sure if she did so unconsciously, but her fingers grasped the blue stone necklace.</p>

      <p>「Since we are battling on equal terms, you don’t have to worry about me losing to the second son. Just watch me.」</p>

      <p>Ai Fa left.</p>

      <p>「Hi, you guys are back.」</p>

      <p>At this moment, Ludo Wu walked over nimbly.</p>

      <p>「Darum-nii is with Ai Fa right now. Are they going to battle?」</p>

      <p>「Seems like it. No matter how good Ai Fa is, I don’t think she can defeat Darum-nii.」</p>

      <p>When he heard Lala Wu’s words, Ludo Wu grunted and flicked back her yellowish-brown hair.</p>

      <p>「Alright then, I will just find another opponent. Even if we leave these two alone, they will still make it to the next round.」</p>

      <p>「Ludo Wu! If Ai Fa and Darum Wu compete, who will win?」</p>

      <p>I couldn’t suppress the unease in my heart and asked.</p>

      <p>Ludo Wu shrugged and answered</p>

      <p>「How would I know? In a test of might, even the strong might lose because of a tiny mistake. Unless there is a deep gulf in prowess, of course.」</p>

      <p>「… Who is stronger, Ai Fa or Darum Wu?」</p>

      <p>When he heard my rude question, Ludo Wu made a funny face at me.</p>

      <p>「Who will tell you such things? Hey, Shin Wu is up next.」</p>

      <p>Like what Ludo Wu said, Shin Wu and an unfamiliar youth entered the central plaza.</p>

      <p>Ai Fa and Darum Wu stood quietly behind the tall old man who was acting as the referee— the former head of the Lutim house, Raa Lutim. They were the next pair of contestants.</p>

      <p>「Hmm, that’s the youngest son of the Min house. Maybe Shin Wu can win… Huh? What’s wrong, Shela Wu? Shin Wu is competing right now, you know?」</p>

      <p>Ludo Wu’s words surprised me, and I turned towards Shela Wu.</p>

      <p>Shela Wu didn’t seem to notice Ludo Wu calling out to her. She wasn’t looking at her brother with teary eyes, but the two behind him.</p>

      <p>At this moment, Shin Wu fended off the attacks from the youngest son of the Min house and subdued him. Basked in heated gazes and cheers, Ai Fa and Darum Wu walked to the middle of the plaza.</p>

      <p>「To my right, Darum Wu of the Wu clan. To my left, Ai Fa of the Fa house. Show us your honor as hunters.」</p>

      <p>Even with the cheers coming from all around him, Raa Lutim’s voice was still loud and clear as he announced the names of the two contestants.</p>

      <p>Ai Fa and Darum Wu stood about five meters apart and faced each other.</p>

      <p>Their height difference was half-a-head, and the weight difference was more than 10 kg. Even though Darum Wu was leaner than a normal man, Ai Fa was even skinnier than him.</p>

      <p>Could Ai Fa really win against him?</p>

      <p>You lose if your torso touches the ground; because of the simplicity of this rule, body build and muscle power weren’t enough to ensure victory. However, I thought Ai Fa was better matched against a hulk like Jii Mamu.</p>

      <p>This example might sound extreme, but if the opponent was Mida, I believed Ai Fa could definitely win. Even Vena Wu could trip Mida if she had a krilee stick.</p>

      <p>However, what if the opponent was Darum Wu? They were different because of their genders, but I thought Ai Fa and Darum Wu had a similar style. Both of them had the body as taut as a whip, sharp like steel, long slender limbs and possessed agility and tenacity… From their body build alone, Ludo Wu and Shin Wu were closer to Ai Fa, but on the whole, I thought Ai Fa was more similar to Darum Wu.</p>

      <p>Although their type was similar, Darum Wu was one size bigger than Ai Fa. Such an opponent was probably difficult to deal with. An example would be a fight between two boxers whose weight classes were more than 10 kg apart.</p>

      <p>When a boxer fought with a sumo wrestler, some battles would favor the contestant with a smaller build. The same applied when a boxer got matched up against a wrestler or a karate practitioner. The rules of the match would become the deciding factor, not the size of the fighter.</p>

      <p>However, the rules for the test of might contest didn’t pose any disadvantage to both parties. Mida and the others might be hindered by these rules, but that didn’t apply to Darum Wu.</p>

      <p>What did Ai Fa think about her chances of winning?</p>

      <p>As I was lowering my head troubling over that, Raa Lutim announced the start of the match.</p>

      <p>「Begin!」</p>

      <p>Darum Wu lowered his stance a little.</p>

      <p>Ai Fa did the same.</p>

      <p>I was about ten meters from the middle of the plaza, but I could feel the intense bestial fire burning in their eyes. It was like a wolf and a lynx howling and staring down each other.</p>

      <p>In a blink of an eye, Darum Wu reached out with his right arm.</p>

      <p>Ai Fa swiftly jumped to the outer side of his arm.</p>

      <p>Before Ai Fa could close in, Darum Wu quickly turned to face her.</p>

      <p>Their agility was about the same.</p>

      <p>However, their arm strength was different because of their body build. How would Ai Fa find a path to victory?</p>

      <p>If this was really a duel between a wolf and a lynx, the one that injured the weak point of the other party, such as the eyes or throat would win. But this contest forbade the use of such attack which could overcome the difference in body build.</p>

      <p>Darum Wu carefully punched and kicked, and Ai Fa fended him off. With Darum Wu one-sided attacks, time passed by slowly.</p>

      <p>Before I knew it, the crowd had gone quiet. These two seemed to have infected the crowd with their tense atmosphere.</p>

      <p>And then… the situation changed suddenly.</p>

      <p>Ai Fa who was on the defensive suddenly charged into Darum Wu’s chest, her bold move felt a little reckless.</p>

      <p>She lowered her head and attempted to headbutt Darum Wu’s stomach. Darum Wu twisted his body nimbly and tried to hit Ai Fa’s neck with his right elbow.</p>

      <p>Ai Fa seemed to be able to see behind her, and she lowered her body even more to dodge the elbow strike. She then went around her opponent’s right side, and her arm reached Darum Wu’s back.</p>

      <div class="imgBox">
        <img src="../Images/0010.png" alt="Illustration"/><!--  https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/-IRyvqm1zSfYg3bjkqJ28WMl62-PPxRNU9KV5QRBybW_4eZ6Ez-WbXj5HdgDEQGhf22vZ_D3-XyzVP1QZucIM9JY0RHc5CA_KjzhqpcCgMbGAxAMEuuxWI82IBaKSAP39bOGdRe6  -->
      </div>

      <p>Ai Fa’s fingers grabbed the back of Darum Wu’s shirt.</p>

      <p>「Ughh!?」</p>

      <p>Darum Wu sneered angrily and then threw his right elbow towards Ai Fa behind him.</p>

      <p>Ai Fa started moving too; she kept the same distance from Darum Wu, staying right behind him, so Darum Wu’s attack missed.</p>

      <p>Ai Fa’s other hand also grabbed the back of Darum Wu’s shirt, with both hands grabbing the spots close to his shoulders. Their position was strange, like a centipede fight of sorts.</p>

      <p>「What kind of joke is this! Fight me fair and square!」</p>

      <p>Darum Wu yelled as he swung his elbow and roared at Ai Fa again.</p>

      <p>From his position and angle, it was impossible for his attack to reach.</p>

      <p>「Attacking the weak point is also a proper tactic.」</p>

      <p>With these words, Ai Fa turned around.</p>

      <p>Her fingers were still grabbing Darum Wu’s shirt.</p>

      <p>When she turned around, her right leg kicked at Darum Wu’s left heel, making him lose balance. Ai Fa then bent over, and Darum Wu’s feet were airborne.</p>

      <p>Darum Wu’s waist stuck closely to Ai Fa’s waist, and he flipped over backward and landed on his head.</p>

      <p><a id="fnref17"></a>Was this a back against back over shoulder throw? What a strange and terrifying technique. If this was a judo match, the referee would never allow such a move.<a href="../Text/Notes.xhtml#fn17" epub:type="noteref">[17]</a></p>

      <p>But they weren’t in a judo match; instead, it was the contest of might. Hence, Raa Lutim declared Ai Fa the victor.</p>

      <p>「The match is over! Winner, Ai Fa of the Fa house! Darum Wu of the Wu clan, please leave the arena.」</p>

      <p>Darum Wu managed to protect his head with his arms at the last moment, but he seemed to have a mild head concussion. He was groaning on the ground with his hands on his head.</p>

      <p>Cheers erupted like a dam breaking. Ai Fa stood quietly in place for a moment and then finally squatted down beside Darum Wu with a worried face.</p>

      <p>And then, Darum Wu’s right arm sprung out like a snake and grabbed Ai Fa’s left shoulder.</p>

      <p>I was feeling relieved but stood up quickly in reaction.</p>

      <p>But Darum Wu didn’t do anything else. He just laid on the ground while grabbing Ai Fa’s shoulder, and stared at Ai Fa’s face.</p>

      <p>「Oh, he got utterly beaten by you! Darum Wu, you still alive?」</p>

      <p>Someone walked towards us with large strides with those cheerful words. It was the head of the Lutim house, Dan Lutim, whom I had not seen in a long while.</p>

      <p>After the house head conference, Kaslan Lutim became an advisor to the tribal chief Donda Wu and had to run all over the place. And so, Dan Lutim took on the responsibility of protecting his own house and the rest of the kin houses. Hence, Ai Fa and I had not seen him for half a month.</p>

      <p>After half a month, he was still the same. His face was like a cheery Arabian demon god, with a bold, innocent, and happy smile.</p>

      <p>「Aside from Donda Wu and me, I never thought that there is someone who can throw Darum Wu down like this! What an interesting match! Ai Fa, hurry up and win another match and then test your might against me.」</p>

      <p>As Dan Lutim spoke, he reached his arm under Darum Wu’s left armpit and easily picked him up. Darum Wu was heaved onto Dan Lutim’s round body, and his hand finally left Ai Fa’s shoulder.</p>

      <p>「No, I don’t want to disrupt the Wu clan’s festival any further. I still need to tend to the hearth, so I have to go now.」</p>

      <p>Ai Fa said as she stood up, and Dan Lutim replied with a hearty laugh:</p>

      <p>「You can’t do that! Amongst the hunting kins of the Wu clan, Darum Wu is one of the elites. Since you won against him convincingly, I must see the full extent of your abilities, or I won’t be able to enjoy this festival!」</p>

      <p>「But…」</p>

      <p>「This is a harvest festival, right? It’s a ritual where the hunters celebrate our harvest and display our might to the forest! Hearth caretakers have their job, while hunters have theirs! You are an outstanding hunter, so you just need to perform your duty as one!」</p>

      <p>After that, Dan Lutim refused to listen to Ai Fa’s objections and returned to the wall of people with Darum Wu on his shoulders.</p>

      <p>Deafening cheers surrounded Ai Fa again as she returned victoriously.</p>

      <p>「… Thank you for your hard work. No matter what, I feel relieved.」</p>

      <p>Ai Fa just sighed without answering.</p>

      <p>A small figure approached us quietly from behind and jumped onto Ai Fa’s back.</p>

      <p>「Ai Fa, you are amazing! Not just Jii Mamu, you even defeated Darum-nii! You are so cool!」</p>

      <p>「… You are heavy; Rimee Wu, don’t cling to me.」</p>

      <p>「Don’t wanna.」</p>

      <p>Rimee Wu rubbed her cheeks against Ai Fa’s with a brilliant smile.</p>

      <p>I remembered something that worried me at this moment and looked Shela Wu’s way.</p>

      <p>Shela Wu closed her eyes tightly as she clasped her hands before her breasts with her face in desperate prayer.</p>
    </section>

    <section epub:type="subchapter">
      <h3 id="sigil_toc_id_16">3</h3>

      <p>「Alright then, let’s start cooking.」</p>

      <p>Everyone returned to the stove room in Shin Wu’s house.</p>

      <p>The participants were the members helping with the stall, Vena Wu, Shela Wu and Lala Wu.</p>

      <p>After that, Shin Wu lost his next battle to Jii Mamu who challenged him and got knocked out of the competition with one win and two losses. After watching his intense battle, we started preparing dinner.</p>

      <p>I was worried about Ai Fa who was still in the tournament, but since her battle with Darum Wu ended without incident, I could only pray that there won’t be any accidents.</p>

      <p>「Let’s start with the preparation work for offal, their freshness is the most important factor.」</p>

      <p>The pot by my feet was filled with the kiba offal from Ai Fa’s hunt today. Since Ai Fa wasn’t here, I performed my first evisceration in a long while.</p>

      <p>I already planned for this in advance. If Ai Fa hunted a kiba today and bloodlet it properly, I would prepare this dish for everyone.</p>

      <p>We carried the kiba to the stream behind the village. This was downstream of the water source used by the main house. This river meandered around the east of the Wu clan village. I guess the Wu clan settled here because of this beautiful river. Eighty years ago, when the denizens migrated to Forest's Edge, the Wu clan was already a powerful house.</p>

      <p>Upon reaching the water source, I taught the Wu clan women the washing method I just learned yesterday. With their great cooking skills, they cleaned the bloodied offal in no time.</p>

      <p>「Please remember the color of the organs. When kiba falls ill, the color of its organs will turn strange. Eating them will result in serious food poisoning, so just return it to the forest if they make you feel uneasy.」</p>

      <p>「Hmmp, what a pain… Is the offal of the kiba so delicious, that people are willing to spend so much effort on it…?」</p>

      <p>「Everyone has different preference. Those who like it will love it, while the opposite is also true.」</p>

      <p>When we came back to the Shin Wu house, Shin Wu and Ryada Wu were waiting for us in front of the stove room.</p>

      <p>「Asuta, if you need to skin the kiba, we can help.」</p>

      <p>「Ehh? Don’t you need to watch the competition?」</p>

      <p>「The eight braves have been decided, and the competition will stop for a short break. I’m not a hunter, so that ceremony has nothing to do with me in the first place.」</p>

      <p>Ryada Wu answered.</p>

      <p>Father and son resembled each other; both of them had long dark brown hair, high corner eyes that looked like a Semu, and quiet expression. Shin Wu would definitely become a calm and mature man in the future.</p>

      <p>「Thank you, Ryada Wu… Ah, Shin Wu, did Ai Fa progress to the next round?」</p>

      <p>「Yes. A man from the Lei house challenged her and lost. She also defeated Darum Wu and Jii Mamu and deserves to be called a brave… By the way, she wanted me to relay to you that she apologizes for not being able to help with the hearth during rest time. Rimee Wu dragged her to Jiba Wu’s chambers, so she had to go.」</p>

      <p>After hearing Ai Fa’s message, Shin Wu was worried that we won’t have enough help and came here together with Ryada Wu. Including Shela Wu, I was very much indebted to this family.</p>

      <p>「Can you tell me who else are left? Aside from Papa Donda, Dan Lutim and Ai Fa, are Jiza-nii and Kaslan Lutim in the tournament too?」</p>

      <p>Shin Wu nodded at Lala Wu’s question.</p>

      <p>「The other three are Ludo Wu, Rau Lei, and Mida.」</p>

      <p>「Ehh〜, Mida actually qualified!? How cocky! Hmm, Jii Mamu didn’t make it?」</p>

      <p>「Yes, Mida defeated him.」</p>

      <p>Lala Wu opened her arms and yelled again: 「How cocky!」</p>

      <p>Shela Wu who looked dejected for a while said timidly.</p>

      <p>「Then… Is Darum Wu alright?」</p>

      <p>「I didn’t see him, but he should be fine. If he got hurt, Ai Fa would be disqualified and someone else would become one of the eight braves… But Darum Wu only lost once, and he went home without challenging anyone else.」</p>

      <p>「I see…」</p>

      <p>Shela Wu sighed sorrowfully.</p>

      <p>Shin Wu looked at her for a moment and then shifted his gaze back to me.</p>

      <p>「Well then, let’s start our work. Is the kiba inside this room?」</p>

      <p>「Ah, please wait! I need to do something before you skin it.」</p>

      <p>I placed the pot full of offal back into the stove room, picked up the necessary tools, and followed Shin Wu and the others to the slaughterhouse.</p>

      <p>「Hold on a bit.」</p>

      <p>A 60-kg kiba that was one size bigger than yesterday was strung up in the middle of the room.</p>

      <p>We took the eviscerated kiba down and placed it on a platform and then painted the oil I brought from the Fa house only on its right hind leg.</p>

      <p>「Asuta, what are you going to do?」</p>

      <p>「It might be a bit of a waste, but I want to burn off the fur from this leg.」</p>

      <p>As both father and son fell into puzzled silence, I used the Rana grass to lit a stick and moved the fire near the kiba hind leg. The dark-colored fur smeared with oil started to burn, and the mix of stenches coming from blood and burning fur gave off a terrible smell.</p>

      <p>If I burned it too much, the skin would get scorched too. So after burning as much fur as I could without harming the skin, I doused the flame with water and was done.</p>

      <p>「Alright then, before skinning it, can you cut off its right hind leg? I plan to use it to make a dish tonight.」</p>

      <p>Parent and child probably had plenty of questions, but they didn’t ask anything. Be it good or bad, the two silent men wouldn’t comment on the work in the stove room.</p>

      <p>「After cutting off the right hind leg, can it be skinned as usual?」</p>

      <p>「Yes, thank you. I still need to prepare the food for my stall, so you will be a big help.」</p>

      <p>After thanking the quiet father and son, I returned triumphantly with my prize.</p>

      <p>「Uwah〜, what is that?」</p>

      <p>Lala Wu, the girl who was not quiet at all, asked me.</p>

      <p>「As you can see, it’s the leg of a kiba. I just burned off its fur. The next steps will be much easier now.」</p>

      <p>Before that, we had to take care of the offal.</p>

      <p>I marinated the chopped offal in a liquid made from myam, fruit wine, and Tau sauce, and buried the heart, liver, and kidney with Pico leaves. I planned to season it with salt and Pico leaves which would take the place of pepper.</p>

      <p>「And then, I need to remove the singed fur on the kiba leg.」</p>

      <p>I used the cleaver in the stove room to shave away the black burned fur.</p>

      <p>After cleaning off most of it, I soaked the entire leg in a pot full of water and used the brush for scrubbing— which was actually hard kiba bristle— to clean it. It was ironic that I was using a brush made from kiba to deal with the kiba fur.</p>

      <p>Anyway, after taking care of it carefully, the skin on the hind leg was exposed. The pinkish skin resembled that of a human or a pig. In the past— or should I say, in my previous life— before I came to Forest's Edge, I participated in a farm experience camp. Back then, the hunting hobbyist once told us verbally how to deal with the fur. I tried it out once in the Fa house, and the hide that had been burned couldn’t be sold, so Ai Fa gave me the stink eye that day.</p>

      <p>The truth was, Ai Fa secretly gave out the hide of the kiba she hunted to the minor houses. This was an open secret, but she still insisted that she threw away all the hides. I felt bad that Ai Fa couldn’t complain to me because of her lies, so I only used fire to remove the fur just that one time.</p>

      <p>「And so? Why are you burning the fur? The bigger the hide, the more copper plates it can be exchanged for, right?」</p>

      <p>「I can only answer 『it tastes better this way』. Everyone can only enjoy this luxurious meal during festivals… Can you accept this explanation?」</p>

      <p>「I don’t know. It’s fine, right? This kiba was caught by Ai Fa anyway, so the Fa house can do whatever it wants with it.」</p>

      <p>That was right, I only dared to use this method because Ai Fa caught this kiba, but I felt relief that she agreed with me. With the simple and thrifty lifestyle of Forest's Edge, I had to avoid any actions that might get interpreted as splurging.</p>

      <p>After receiving Donda Wu’s request, I only had one day to think up the dish. I could only re-mesh the dishes I tried out in the Fa house and try to serve a brand new dish. It was a little troubling.</p>

      <p>「And so, how will you deal with this leg? The contest of might will end before dusk.」</p>

      <p>「I need time to marinate the meat, so that is just enough time… Shela Wu, do you want to learn this cooking method? It’s different from the way I usually do it.」</p>

      <p>I said that because Shela Wu looked distracted and looked different from usual.</p>

      <p>「Ehh? Ah, sorry… I should concentrate on work.」</p>

      <p>Shela Wu patted her own cheeks.</p>

      <p>「I will focus… My house probably can’t burn the kiba fur away.」</p>

      <p>「This dish is just for the feast today. I wanted to make it feel more lavish, so I left the skin. If Ai Fa didn’t hunt this kiba, I was planning to make this dish with normal leg meat. Let’s start the preparation work then.」</p>

      <p>I deboned the leg and carved it out into large pieces. I would present one kg of it to the winner of the Battle of Skill and use the other three kg for the other dishes.</p>

      <p>I carefully tenderized the meat with a clean stick and then rolled the one kg of meat with rock salt and Pico leaves. It was roughly twice the size of a normal steak.</p>

      <p>I then cut some slit on the meat and stuffed myam into the openings in the place of garlic. And with that, the preparation work was complete.</p>

      <p>「We will let the meat rest for a while, about the same amount of time we marinate the 『Myam-roasted meat』.」</p>

      <p>Which meant, we would leave the meat there for an hour and another hour was required to cook it. The dish would be done when the sun sets.</p>

      <p>「Before that, we need to take care of the stall preparation for tomorrow. Vena Wu and Lala Wu, please help me with mincing the meat for the hamburg steak. Shela Wu, please dice the aria.」</p>

      <p>I started cutting the meat to be used in the other dishes.</p>

      <p>While Shin Wu and his father were helping me skin the kiba, I cut off some loin and abdomen meat from the torso. The way the meat was cut would affect the taste, and I couldn’t let others do this delicate work.</p>

      <p>I used the knife Ai Fa gave me to cut them into slabs and then used the Santoku knife to cut them into thin slices.</p>

      <p>I’m working my dad’s knife too hard, it’s about time to buy a specialized meat cutting knife.</p>

      <p>That was what I thought, but after browsing the meat cutting knives sold in the Post Station Town, I realized that their sharpness was on par with hunting knives, so I couldn’t push myself to make the purchase. On top of that, I bought a top of the line vegetable cutting knife from Shumimaru recently, so I was even more reluctant to make a compromise.</p>

      <p>High-quality knives were probably sold in the castle town, but I needed to see the blade personally before making the purchase. It would be great if Shumimaru also sold meat-cutting knives.</p>

      <p>When I was thinking about this, the plaza became rowdy again. It seemed that rest time was over, and the Battle of Skill was restarting.</p>

      <p>Fifteen minutes later, Rimee Wu charged into the stove room with ragged breath and her face red.</p>

      <p>「Amazing! Ai Fa won again! Ai Fa just needs to win two more matches to be the number one brave!」</p>

      <p>「Ehh〜? Who did she win?」</p>

      <p>Lala Wu asked in my place.</p>

      <p>「Her opponent was Rau Lei! Rau Lei was good, but Ai Fa threw him out easily! Easily!」</p>

      <p>Her opponent was Rau Lei, huh.</p>

      <p>Since she was victorious against Darum Wu, she could definitely defeat Rau Lei. This meant that Ai Fa had made it into the final four. I didn’t know whether I should be happy for her performance and felt conflicted</p>

      <p>「What about the others? Ludo?」</p>

      <p>「Ludo lost! He tried to trip Mida, but fell down himself!」</p>

      <p>「Hmmp〜, in the end, he still can’t get a match against Papa. He must be frustrated. In that case, the ones left are…」</p>

      <p>「Papa Donda, Kaslan Lutim, Jiza-nii, and Dan Lutim! Jiza-nii is up next, I’m going to watch!」</p>

      <p>Donda Wu against Kaslan Lutim and Jiza Wu against Dan Lutim… Coincidentally, this was the head against heir cross match from the Wu clan and Lutim house. What an incredible lineup, which made feel like watching, and, at the same time, I didn’t feel like watching it too.</p>

      <p>「Jiza-nii and Kaslan Lutim are both amazing, but they can’t defeat Papa Donda and Dan Lutim. These two were the finalists for the past ten years.」</p>

      <p>I was surprised to hear Lala Wu say that.</p>

      <p>「T-Ten years? What an incredible record… There are three harvest festival every year, correct?」</p>

      <p>「Yes, one large scale and two smaller scale festivals every year. By the way, today’s festival is small scale. All the kins will attend the large-scale festival.」</p>

      <p>Three times a year, that meant thirty times in a decade. Either Donda Wu or Dan Lutim had won the tournament every single time. Their prowess was outstanding amongst the denizens of Forest's Edge; I had always vaguely felt that point.</p>

      <p>And then— Ai Fa would be matched up with one of them. Although the Battle of Skill would ensure the safety of all participants, my stomach still hurt from thinking about that.</p>

      <p>It’s impossible for Ai Fa to win the tournament.</p>

      <p>That thought also gave me stomach cramps. If Ai Fa had to battle with Donda Wu in the finals, I would be terrified.</p>

      <p>Time flew by, and the preparation work was ending soon. From my body clock, I estimated there was still one more hour before sunset. I had to prepare the dish for the winner.</p>

      <p>「Well then, I’m going to start. First, sear the outside with a strong fire, just like braised kiba.」</p>

      <p>I placed the completely marinated chunk of meat onto the griddle, and the surface turned brown. Just like the preparation of steaks and hamburg steak, this was done to seal in the juice.</p>

      <p>「After that, spread the cut vegetables into the pot with a small fire.」</p>

      <p>I chopped the arias and Chachi ahead of time.</p>

      <p>The arias were quartered into crescent shapes, while the Chachi was split boldly in half. I spread them across the entire pot and then placed the grilled meat on top.</p>

      <p>「Next, pour in a quarter bottle of fruit wine and then cover the lid. We will need to weigh it down with rocks.」</p>

      <p>「Is that all? This is really similar to that 『Braised kiba』 dish.」</p>

      <p>「That’s right. However, we cooked 『Braised kiba』 by using water and sauce and only added fruit wine to this dish for the aroma. This dish uses the moisture from fruit wine and vegetables to steam it, instead of boiling it.」</p>

      <p>When adding more firewood, I took care not to let the fire get too big.</p>

      <p>「When making 『Kiba burgers』 or steaks, I would switch to steaming midway to cook the dish thoroughly, right? This meat is even thicker, so the steaming would be even longer. You can think about it that way.」</p>

      <p>「I see… What dish is this?」</p>

      <p>「For now, I dub it 『Roast kiba』.」</p>

      <p>This wasn’t a dish served in my home or restaurant, but the method to roast beef which I used when Dad, Leina, and I went camping.</p>

      <p>It would be great if there was an iron lid that covered the pot tightly. Unfortunately, the Post Station Town in Genos didn’t sell such lids. However, I already tried steaming 10 cm thick slabs of meat, and it was proven to work.</p>

      <p>The plan this time was to prepare an amazingly thick slab of meat. I thought that presenting a generous dish to the winner of the contest of might was fitting, but I wondered if the champion would think so.</p>

      <p>「The important thing is the fire. Please keep it at a weaker level than the usual weak fire. If the flame is too big, the vegetables touching the bottom of the pot will burn.」</p>

      <p>We just needed to continue steaming it for 40 to 50 minutes, and we would be done.</p>

      <p>The preparation for tomorrow was finished too, and the girls were free to go now. I was just thinking that when Rimee Wu ran over again.</p>

      <p>「Asuta, you are still not done? The next match is Dan Lutim against Ai Fa!」</p>

      <p>「Ehh! The semifinal is Ai Fa against Dan Lutim?」</p>

      <p>「Yes! Both Jiza-nii and Kaslan Lutim lost! After Ai Fa’s match is Papa Donda versus Mida!」</p>

      <p>Ai Fa against Dan Lutim and Mida against Donda Wu, huh.</p>

      <p>What a heart-pounding pairing.</p>

      <p>「Asuta, go take a look, I will watch the fire.」</p>

      <p>Shela Wu said with a calm smile.</p>

      <p>「Vena Wu, Lala Wu, you are worried about Donda Wu’s match too, right? Just leave this place to me.」</p>

      <p>「Ehh〜, can I?」</p>

      <p>Lala Wu looked at me squirmingly.</p>

      <p>I was troubled, but I still restrained my desires.</p>

      <p>「I will be there when the job is done. Lala Wu, go watch the match. You too, Shela Wu.」</p>

      <p>「No, my family isn’t competing… Asuta, is this really fine?」</p>

      <p>「Yes. Dan Lutim definitely won’t hurt Ai Fa. I will also do my job properly.」</p>

      <p>「Alright then, we are off! I will let you know the result of the match!」</p>

      <p>The sisters from the Wu clan main house left, leaving just Shela Wu and me to work in the stove room.</p>

      <p>That might be so, but we didn’t need to do anything other than adding firewood every few minutes. I stared at the wavering orange flame as I kept praying for Ai Fa’s safety in my heart.</p>

      <p>「… Ai Fa is really exceptional as a hunter. Recently, Darum Wu and Rau Lei can fight on par with Jiza Wu and Kaslan Lutim in a match, you know?」</p>

      <p>Shela Wu and I squatted before the stove, and she finally said quietly.</p>

      <p>「I see. Ai Fa is hunting kiba at an alarming rate too… By the way, I hope Darum Wu will get well soon.」</p>

      <p>When Shela Wu heard what I said, she just sighed depressedly.</p>

      <p>Feeling uneasy, I continued:<br class="kix-line-break"/></p>

      <p>「Oh right, Darum Wu got badly injured when he protected Shin Wu last month. I interact with him the least of all the Wu clan main house members, what kind of person is he?」</p>

      <p>「Darum Wu… is very rash. According to my father Ryada, of all the main house siblings, Darum Wu resembles Donda Wu the most.」</p>

      <p>「That’s true, his eyes look just like Donda Wu.」</p>

      <p>「Yes… I think Donda Wu and Darum Wu are both outstanding hunters that befit the status of the tribal chief house.」</p>

      <p>I couldn’t get along with both of them though.</p>

      <p>However, I have known since a long time ago that Donda Wu wasn’t a simple brute. I might not get along well with him, but I didn’t hate him either. As for Darum Wu— because of the commotion with him over Ai Fa, there was a deep gulf between us. When I heard him mocking Ai Fa intentionally, I thought of him as lowly as Diga Tsun; both of them made me mad.</p>

      <p>「… Does Ai Fa plan to be a hunter until she withers away in the forest?」</p>

      <p>Shela Wu finally spoke quietly again.</p>

      <p>「She is a woman, but instead of raising children, she lives as a hunter… No, I’m not refuting her lifestyle, but I don’t understand why she thinks in such a way.」</p>

      <p>「I don’t know either, but I think this suits her really well.」</p>

      <p>「I just hate the life of waiting for the men to come back everyday…」: Ai Fa told me that in the past. Instead of being protected, she would rather be the one protecting others.</p>

      <p>I didn’t really understand the truth behind her words, but my wish to respect her feelings remained the same. However, I didn’t want to be a carefree character that gets protected. Aside from strength, I wanted to watch over Ai Fa in other areas.</p>

      <p>「… Ai Fa has no intention of marrying anyone?」</p>

      <p>「Yes, that’s probably so…」</p>

      <p>I was surprised at mid-sentence. Shela Wu was hugging her knees, squatting on the floor, and staring at the flames; her face looked really red.</p>

      <p>「S-Shela Wu, what’s wrong?」</p>

      <p>「Ehh? Is something the matter?」</p>

      <p>「No, it’s just that… you look different from usual.」</p>

      <p>「Is that so? Maybe…」</p>

      <p>Shela Wu covered the lower half of her blushing face with her arms that were hugging her knees. Her helpless gaze shifted towards me.</p>

      <p>「Just the thought that you might know how I really feel made me embarrassed. Sorry.」</p>

      <p>「Y-Your feelings? You mean… for Darum Wu?」</p>

      <p>「P-Please don’t say it!」</p>

      <p>This was the first time I saw her being so panicky. For the first time, the mature and quiet Shela Wu showed her girly side.</p>

      <p>Even though Shela Wu looks so mature, she is just one year older than me.</p>

      <p>I felt a little distraught. Was this unfamiliar feeling the so-called protective instinct?</p>

      <p>「… Asuta.」</p>

      <p>「Yes.」</p>

      <p>「… Please don’t tell anyone else, okay?」</p>

      <p>「Okay! I will keep it a secret!」</p>

      <p>「Also, don’t worry or sympathize with me. I'm just a woman who can’t even move a water flask, and I don’t have the rights to pick a husband.」</p>

      <p>「That’s not true!」</p>

      <p>I thought over it for a moment and decided to stand up.</p>

      <p>「Shela Wu, can you help me cook this piece of meat that has its skin attached?」</p>

      <p>「Ehh?」</p>

      <p>「I plan to grill this into a simple meat steak and give it out to everyone. I want you to help me cook this meat and make the sauce by yourself.」</p>

      <p>「W-What should I do…?」</p>

      <p>「You have to decide by yourself.」</p>

      <div class="imgBox">
        <img src="../Images/0012.png" alt="Illustration"/><!--  https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/wjEbbuUKBJGxyk088-cYaMCHJwMbZ7cDKnRS5woRyw2bbB9sqTwUDK0WZzC8mBuBXPKoh6g5t__0AktZKPsvzNQs8jAdovBSATCbHOw-2sPxiUmdYBQhmAtOheChJtutmbozc8en  -->
      </div>

      <p>Shela Wu lowered her head with her face still red.</p>

      <p>She then tilted her head puzzledly.</p>

      <p>「Speaking of which, Lala Wu and the others aren’t back yet. She said that she will tell you the results after Ai Fa and Dan Lutim are done competing.」</p>

      <p>「Ah, that’s true.」</p>

      <p>It has been 15 minutes.</p>

      <p>The uneasiness I had suppressed was starting to swell again.</p>

      <p>「Ehh〜, does one match take so long?」</p>

      <p>「No. I’m baffled by it too.」</p>

      <p>Cheers continued coming from the arena.</p>

      <p>「Well then, they probably can’t leave the plaza because Donda Wu and Mida’s match is right after that match, right?」</p>

      <p>「No, after finalizing the elite eight, there will be a break after every match… Asuta, you should go check out the situation.」</p>

      <p>「But…」</p>

      <p>「You have always been looking out for me, so I’m just paying you back. Please go over… I also want some time to mull over my feelings.」</p>

      <p>She probably said all that after noticing how I felt. But even if she didn’t, I could no longer suppress the uneasiness in my heart.</p>

      <p>「Excuse me, I will go take a look.」</p>

      <p>With that, I charged out of the stove room.</p>

      <p>Ai Fa’s opponent was Dan Lutim. He called the Fa house his friend, so things wouldn’t go badly… That’s what I thought, but I couldn’t keep my heart from wavering.</p>

      <p>Did one of them suffer a serious injury?</p>

      <p>Or did a malicious third party disrupt the contest?</p>

      <p>I entered the plaza worriedly, and the hearty laughter of Dan Lutim wiped all my unfounded fears away.</p>

      <p>「Ai Fa! You are really a superb hunter! Aside from Donda Wu, this is the first time I have met such a challenging opponent!」</p>

      <p><a id="fnref18"></a>Dan Lutim stood in the center of the arena with his feet wide apart. His Ebisu-like face, shiny bald head, and round tummy were drenched with sweat.<a href="../Text/Notes.xhtml#fn18" epub:type="noteref">[18]</a></p>

      <p>Facing off against him a few meters away was the equally sweaty Ai Fa. She had a casual expression on her face in her match against Jii Mamu, but she was sweating profusely now, with her shoulders heaving widely.</p>

      <p>It seemed that they had been going at it for the entire 15 minutes.</p>

      <p>「But it is about time to end this! I’m getting hungry!」</p>

      <p>After saying that, Dan Lutim spread out his arms and attempted to grab Ai Fa.</p>

      <p>I was shocked by his nimble movements. His massive body weighed over 100 kg, but his explosiveness was on par with Ai Fa and Darum Wu.</p>

      <p>Ai Fa barely dodged him, but Dan Lutim didn’t stop.</p>

      <p>One of his arms shot out at Ai Fa so fast that the air howled.</p>

      <p>Ai Fa kicked off the side of Dan Lutim’s stomach and lept further back.</p>

      <p>Dan Lutim changed direction with the same blazing speed in pursuit.</p>

      <p>Ai Fa bent down and counter-attacked with the sweep she used to defeat Jii Mamu. But Dan Lutim evaded it easily with a jump.</p>

      <p>Ai Fa immediately pushed off with her palms, dodging like a jumping lynx. Dan Lutim’s fingers closed around the space where Ai Fa’s head was a moment ago.</p>

      <p>The cheers were thunderous. It was the loudest cheer of the day. Did such an amazing match continue for fifteen minutes? I was at a loss for words.</p>

      <p>Dan Lutim was an extraordinary individual. How could he move as fast as Ai Fa despite that large tummy of his? His body weight was twice that of Ai Fa; this was too illogical.</p>

      <p>Not just that, Dan Lutim also laughed loudly from time to time. He looked incredibly gleeful.</p>

      <p>On the other hand, Ai Fa was going all out. Like a lynx being attacked by a brown bear or lowland gorilla.</p>

      <p>「Ai…」</p>

      <p>I shouted unconsciously.</p>

      <p>「Ai Fa! Don’t give up! Get him!」</p>

      <p>Did she hear me…? Ai Fa braced herself and charged into her opponent.</p>

      <p>Dan Lutim didn’t dodge like Darum Wu. Standing his ground firmly, he swung his arms at the approaching Ai Fa.</p>

      <p>Ai Fa twisted her body and went around to Dan Lutim’s right.</p>

      <p>Dan Lutim finally caught her arm.</p>

      <p>At the same time, Ai Fa bent down in an attempt to sweep Dan Lutim’s leg.</p>

      <p>After grabbing Ai Fa firmly, Dan Lutim could have gone for a bold throw. However, he let go of Ai Fa’s arm without hesitation and avoided the attack by lifting one leg.</p>

      <p>Ai Fa’s attack whiffed, so she was about to fall onto the ground. At this moment, Dan Lutim tried to grab her back.</p>

      <p>「Ai Fa!」</p>

      <p>Ai Fa used one light as a pivot and swiftly turned towards Dan Lutim.</p>

      <p>Dan Lutim grabbed her shoulders with his big hands.</p>

      <p>It was over.</p>

      <p>Ai Fa was falling backward, as if she couldn’t withstand Dan Lutim’s charge.</p>

      <p>However… while she was falling, Ai Fa’s right arm grabbed the front of Dan Lutim’s shirt, and her left leg kicked at her opponent’s right ankle.</p>

      <p>Dan Lutim lost his balance for the first time.</p>

      <p>If this continued, Ai Fa would fall too and get crushed by his giant body. Hence, she pressed her knee into his large tummy and shifted her center of gravity downwards.</p>

      <p>She grabbed his chest, kicked his feet and lowered her body. All these actions worked in tandem together… and Dan Lutim’s massive body leaned forward and into the air.</p>

      <p><a id="fnref19"></a>This was probably the circular throw in judo.<a href="../Text/Notes.xhtml#fn19" epub:type="noteref">[19]</a></p>

      <p>But while Ai Fa was doing that, she looked as if she wanted to support herself with her left arm on the ground.</p>

      <p>No, I probably saw it wrong. In the end, Ai Fa’s left hand didn’t touch the ground, and she threw Dan Lutim out with her left knee on his belly.</p>

      <p>Dan Lutim’s huge body drew an arc in the air before falling with a thud.</p>

      <p>The ecstatic crowd erupted in cheers.</p>

      <p>However, Raa Lutim’s stern voice cut through the cheers.</p>

      <p>「Victor, Dan Lutim of the Lutim house! Ai Fa of the Fa house is disqualified!」</p>

      <p>The cheers turned into grumble and boos.</p>

      <p>The white-haired and muscular elder of the Lutim house stared at the crowd with eagle-like eyes.</p>

      <p>「Before Dan Lutim’s torso touched the ground, Ai Fa’s waist was already grounded. Hence, Dan Lutim is the winner!」</p>

      <p>That was why Ai Fa tried to support herself with her left arm midway through the match.</p>

      <p>Ai Fa laid sprawled on the ground and panted. Dan Lutim who was thrown two meters away was also out of breath as he laid on the ground.</p>

      <p>Kaslan Lutim charged out from the crowd to check on his father. I also entered the plaza. With the grumbles coming from behind me, I rushed to Ai Fa’s side.</p>

      <p>「Ai Fa, are you alright!?」</p>

      <p>「I… I’m fine…」</p>

      <p>She opened her mouth wide with her eyes tightly shut and answered hoarsely. This was the first time I have seen Ai Fa so exhausted.</p>

      <p>「Shoulder… Lend me your shoulder… I can’t walk by myself…」</p>

      <p>「I understand.」</p>

      <p>I picked up Ai Fa’s right arm, supported her back and propped her up. Ai Fa’s body was burning hot, and she leaned weakly onto me.</p>

      <p>「My sweat… might dirty you…」</p>

      <p>「It’s fine, don’t worry about that.」</p>

      <p>At this moment, Dan Lutim who was helped up by the powerful arms of his son showed a weak smile:</p>

      <p>「I thought that I lost! Ai Fa, why didn’t you support yourself with your left arm? If you did, you would have won!」</p>

      <p>「… My left arm just healed; I wasn’t sure if it could support your huge body. If my arm dislocates again, I won’t be able to hunt.」</p>

      <p>「I see, so that’s the reason! I understand.」</p>

      <p>Dan Lutim pulled Kaslan Lutim to walk towards us and suddenly leaned his sweaty smiling face towards Ai Fa:</p>

      <p>「You are really an exemplary hunter! Not only are you powerful, you also know what is important! Ai Fa, I’m glad to be friends with an outstanding hunter like you!」</p>

      <p>「You flatter me… I will make a move first.」</p>

      <p>After saying that, Ai Fa kicked my leg.</p>

      <p>She was hinting that 「it is time to go」. I nodded at the gleeful Dan Lutim and Kaslan Lutim who was smiling awkwardly and left the plaza with my battle-worn house head.</p>

      <p>The crowd gave their generous applause and cheers for Ai Fa. I couldn’t help smiling awkwardly at how great my house head was.</p>

      <p>「… What’s the matter, Asuta? Are you laughing at me for losing so terribly?」</p>

      <p>「Ehh?」</p>

      <p>I looked at Ai Fa in surprise and found her pouting and leaning against my shoulder.</p>

      <p>「How was that terrible? There aren’t many hunters amongst the kins of the Wu clan who could fight with him to such an extent, right?」</p>

      <p>「… A loss is a loss.」</p>

      <p>「Ehh〜, didn’t Lala Wu tell you earlier? Winning is an honor, but there is no shame in losing. Besides, you performed admirably, so you don’t need to feel frustrated over this match.」</p>

      <p>「No way. I almost won, so, of course, I will feel frustrated.」</p>

      <p>My house head was still pouting cutely, as she pressed her blonde head against my cheeks firmly in retaliation against me.</p>

      <h3 id="sigil_toc_id_17">4</h3>

      <p>「Sorry for the wait, this is the dish I prepared for today.」</p>

      <p>When the sun set beyond the western woods, torches were lit around the plaza, and I presented the dinner of blessing to the champion of the Battle of Skill tournament.</p>

      <p>As expected, the winner was Donda Wu.</p>

      <p>In the end, I didn’t see any of Donda Wu’s matches. In the semi-finals, when Mida who had the size advantage charged at him, Donda Wu took him on directly and then tossed Mida aside, displaying the difference in power between them. In the match against the exhausted Dan Lutim, Donda Wu didn’t stall the battle, twisting the arm of his opponent with exceptional skill and pushing him onto the ground.</p>

      <p>The champion sat on a mini wooden platform, and he crossed his legs with one leg propped up as usual. The grand elder Grandma Jiba placed a grass crown of blessing on his messy brown hair.</p>

      <p>He showed his usual sour face, with his usual intimidating aura. But he fought elites like Kaslan Lutim, Mida, and Dan Lutim in quick succession earlier, so his face was full of sweat, and his shoulders and chest were rising slightly. His gaze fell on the plate I presented to him.</p>

      <p>This was the biggest plate in the Wu clan village, and I placed the dish for today in it. It was full of steaming hot Chachi, aria, and one kg of 『Roast kiba』 in the middle of the plate.</p>

      <p>「… I thought you would present something more spectacular, but it looks really normal.」</p>

      <p>「Yes, but I hope it suits your taste.」</p>

      <p>I cut the 『Roast kiba』 into thick slabs instead of thin slices and poured a special sauce over it. This was made with Tau sauce and fruit wine as the base, and diced aria, myam, salt, Pico leaves, and the caramel-colored kiba juice that dripped off during the roasting were other ingredients. It was the most delicious sauce I had ever made.</p>

      <p>「Please eat it while it’s hot. The special thing about this dish is that it tastes delicious even if it gets cold. But the denizens of Forest's Edge prefer hot dishes, correct?」</p>

      <p>「Hmmp.」</p>

      <p>Donda Wu grunted before standing up.</p>

      <p>The seventy-odd kins stood around the platform and awaited the start of the feast.</p>

      <p>「Well then, let the harvest feast begin! Kins of the Wu clan, offer your thanks to the forest and let its grace become our flesh and blood!」</p>

      <p>「Whoooaaa!」: the people responded with courageous cheers and then grabbed their skewers and fruit wines.</p>

      <p>After seeing that, Donda Wu sat down heavily and reached for the plate. He picked up a piece of 『Roast kiba』 with his skewer and bit down with his white teeth that looked strong enough to crush stones.</p>

      <p>The meat in 『Roast kiba』 wasn’t as tough as normal steaks, but it wasn’t too tender either. After all, I avoided using loin meat and chose the tougher thigh meat.</p>

      <p>Unlike roast beef, the insides of 『Roast kiba』 had to be cooked thoroughly. But I didn’t roast it until it was dry, keeping the pinkish meat juicy and concentrating the fresh taste inside the meat. The tender lean meat that had been adequately stripped of its fats, and the skin had been roasted again until it turned a caramel shade, giving it more variety of taste and texture.</p>

      <p>In order to draw out the basic taste of the ingredient, I didn’t pour too much of the sauce I took pride in on it. Just the salt and Pico leaves I carefully smeared over the meat, and the myam I embedded inside was enough to season the roast meat. The taste would be more prominent after it has cooled down, but it was equally good fresh out of the oven too.</p>

      <p>I had been in Forest's Edge for about 60 days, and this dish combined all the techniques I had learned after coming to Forest's Edge. How did it taste? I wasn’t expecting for Donda Wu to compliment the food when…</p>

      <p>「… Delicious.」</p>

      <p>「Ehh?」</p>

      <p>I lifted my head in surprise.</p>

      <p>Donda Wu had his usual sour face as he took another bite of the 『Roast kiba』 without even looking at me.</p>

      <p>He shifted his gaze suspiciously to his feet. There was a bowl of kiba meat soup prepared by the women of the Wu clan, filled with vegetables, and a plate of grilled poitan and offal.</p>

      <p>「Hey, what’s that? There’s some unfamiliarly shaped meat in there. Did you use the meat of some other animal?」</p>

      <p>「Ah, those are the offal of a kiba. I learned to cook it yesterday, it has an interesting taste.」</p>

      <p>There were grilled kiba heart, liver, kidney, and other offal cut into large pieces.</p>

      <p>「Ai Fa likes the kiba heart. It doesn’t have any unique flavor, and the texture is the same as meat.」</p>

      <p>「… Heart of the kiba, huh.」</p>

      <p>Donda Wu picked up a piece of kiba heart with the skewer and put it in his mouth. He closed his blue burning eyes and chewed slowly.</p>

      <p>Donda Wu swallowed the heart and then took off one of the necklaces from his neck and handed it to me.</p>

      <p>「Thanks for your hard work, here’s the payment.」</p>

      <p>「Ehh? Payment?」</p>

      <p>Now that he mentioned it, we didn’t discuss the payment term at all.</p>

      <p>Be it the house head conference or the uproar that happened after that, the Wu clan had taken great care of us. So I prepared these dishes without expecting any remuneration.</p>

      <p>「Thank you. But isn’t the payment too much?」</p>

      <p>There were around 20 tusks and horns on the necklace, about 5 kiba’s worth or 60 red copper plates.</p>

      <p>「… Are your skills that cheap?」</p>

      <p>Donda Wu tossed the necklace to my chest and focused on eating his 『Roast kiba』.</p>

      <p>He then glared at me unhappily:</p>

      <p>「How long are you going to watch me eat? Your work is done, go eat your food.」</p>

      <p>「Y-Yes. I’m going off now.」</p>

      <p>With an indescribable feeling of hype and happiness in my heart, I left the platform.</p>

      <p>The next instant, a figure charged out like a hound and grabbed my chest.</p>

      <p>「Hey, Asuta! What’s going on here!?」</p>

      <p>「T-That scared me. Why do you look so upset?」</p>

      <p>He had blonde hair, which made me mistake him for Ai Fa, but he was actually the young head of the Lei house, Rau Lei. His aqua-colored eyes were burning as he stared at me from close up.</p>

      <p>「How dare you even ask! I ate your cooking!」</p>

      <p>「Oh, is that so? So why do you look so furious? Was it not to your liking?」</p>

      <p>「How can that be!? I was surprised by how delicious it was! Did you pull your punches for the house head conference!?」</p>

      <p>I was confused.</p>

      <p>However, I had seen a lot of people lose it because of delicious food, so I wasn’t too shaken by his reaction.</p>

      <p>「I’m curious too. Asuta, did you hide your skills during the house head conference? Or did you improve that much in this half a month?」</p>

      <p>The sky was getting dark, and the only sources of light were the torches. A large figure walked over from the other end of the plaza. He had a squarish face, mature demeanor, and well-toned body… &#160;He was one of the three tribal chiefs I had not met for a long time, Dali Sauti.</p>

      <p>「Ah, Dali Sauti, you have recovered from your wounds.」</p>

      <p>「Yes.」</p>

      <p>He nodded magnanimously.</p>

      <p>Ai Fa met him recently because of the Totos issue, but the last time I saw him was right before Zattsu Tsun and gang caused an uproar. Like what Ai Fa said, he had recovered from his injuries.</p>

      <p>By the way, he was speaking with Kamyua Yost in the Post Station Town when I last met him, and he was rather excited. He had reverted to his calm personality tonight and was smiling cheerfully.</p>

      <p>「Sorry for the trouble I caused the other time. It’s great that you look lively… Well then, can you answer the query from the head of the Lei house and me? We have no rights to be mad even if you conceal your true abilities, but I will feel uneasy if you don’t tell me the reason why you did so.」</p>

      <p>「Do you think I hid my skills…?」</p>

      <p>A few days ago, the people from the Wu clan main house praised my improving culinary skills, but, seeing how worked up Rau Lei was, I thought he wanted to tell me something different from that.</p>

      <p>「What are you arguing about? Asuta only made this little, it will be all eaten up if you don’t pay attention.」</p>

      <p>Ludo Wu was holding a large plate as he walked over while eating a thigh steak. That was the thick cut steak I made with the 3 kg of meat. It was complemented with steamed aria, Chachi, and other vegetables. There was only about a quarter of it left.</p>

      <p>「Save me my share! I haven’t eaten my full yet…! Asuta, what’s going on here? You agreed to tend to the hearth for the house head conference for the sake of letting the house heads taste your cooking, correct? So why did you keep your power level a secret?」</p>

      <p>「I’m sorry to hear you say that, but I always give my all in my cooking.」</p>

      <p>「Then, did your skills improved by leaps and bounds in half a month? I also tried your dish during Kaslan Lutim’s wedding! That was twenty days before the house head conference, but the improvement wasn’t so prominent!」</p>

      <p>Rau Lei wasn’t angry, just confused. But I was even more lost than him.</p>

      <p>Ludo Wu easily sorted out our confusion and questions.</p>

      <p>「So, is Asuta’s cooking so delicious that you are shocked? Rau Lei, this is no surprise at all.」</p>

      <p>「But why? Ludo Wu, do you know the reason why his delicious turned delicious?」</p>

      <p>「Of course. The food at the house head conference wasn’t prepared by Asuta. Although Shin Wu and I only ate jerky that night and didn’t taste the food at the house head conference.」</p>

      <p>I didn’t get it immediately.</p>

      <p>After a while, I realized what Ludo Wu was saying.</p>

      <p>「Ah… so that’s how it is.」</p>

      <p>「That’s right. You said that the goal on that day is to teach the Tsun clan woman how to cook, so you and the others would refrain from doing the cooking. Even if they followed your instructions, their cookings wouldn’t be as delicious.」</p>

      <p>But even so, for the people who ate kiba meat that hadn’t been bloodlet everyday, the taste made a great impact. So did the grilled poitan.</p>

      <p>The dish I chose for that day was 『Myam-roasted meat』, and even a poorly skilled person could prepare it. That might be so, but how well cooked the meat was, and the way it was grilled with the sauce would affect the tenderness of the meat and the taste of the dish. The standards of me and the other women instructing the Tsun clan was low to just make sure the meat wasn’t undercooked or burnt.</p>

      <p>No matter what, I felt honored that brutish men like Rau Lei and Dali Sauti were so surprised by the difference.</p>

      <p>「I ate the food at Asuta’s stall in the Post Station Town before. It didn’t taste this delicious.」</p>

      <p>Rau Lei pressed me for answers, and I explained:</p>

      <p>「Back then, I didn’t prepare additional meat patties, so what you ate were 『Myam-roasted meat』, seasoned to the taste of the people in town. Denizens of Forest's Edge might find the taste to be too strong.」</p>

      <p>「That’s right. During the Lutim house’s wedding, the food was prepared by the women of the Wu clan. Rau Lei, this is the first time you are tasting food cooked by Asuta for the denizens of Forest's Edge.」</p>

      <p>Ludo Wu explained as he tossed a Chachi into his mouth.</p>

      <p>「Ah, it tastes great! The meat is tasty, but this Chachi is delicious! I like Chachi.」</p>

      <p>Ludo Wu relaxed and showed a smile as adorable as a girl.</p>

      <p>The matter had been resolved. As I was sighing in relief, someone grabbed Rau Lei’s arm from the side.</p>

      <p>「Hey, head of the Lei house, why are you doing something so rude to Asuta? If you don’t have a good reason, I will be happy to take you on.」</p>

      <p>It was Ai Fa.</p>

      <p>Rau Lei looked troubled and finally let go of my T-shirt.</p>

      <p>「We are not arguing, don’t be so mad… Ai Fa, you want to have another match with me?」</p>

      <p>「No matter how many times we fight, the result will be the same.」</p>

      <p>Ai Fa said with cold fury and flicked away Rau Lei’s hand.</p>

      <p>Rau Lei scratched his nose childishly.</p>

      <p>「Ai Fa, Asuta, you two are too sly! Your house has only two people, but one is the best hearth caretaker, the other is a hunter that pushed Dan Lutim to the limit. I don’t get this!」</p>

      <p>「Who cares what you think.」</p>

      <p>Ai Fa crossed her arms under her breasts smugly and looked at Rau Lei sideways. At this moment, the quiet Dali Sauti laughed softly.</p>

      <p>「When I learned that Donda Wu is holding a harvest feast during such a turbulent time, I thought he was an unexpectedly easy-going man. But at least for me, today has been a meaningful day… Since we have the convenient Totos now, I should have invited Graff Zaza to make a trip here too.」</p>

      <p>「Ehh, what’s that about Graff Zaza?」</p>

      <p>「The Wu clan is outstanding. Not only is the hunter’s prowess impressive, I feel that all the kins of the Wu clan are filled with energy.」</p>

      <p>Dali Sauti surveyed the entire plaza.</p>

      <p>Illuminated by the torches and the makeshift stoves, everyone was smiling happily. It was a joyous feast, and I saw the same thing during the Lutim house wedding banquet too.</p>

      <p>Everyone and their beloved family and kins were enjoying delicious food, drinking wine and making merry. For someone from another world, this powerful and heated scene made me dizzy… Wasn’t this a familiar scene when a feast was held in Forest's Edge?</p>

      <p>「Other than the Wu clan, the Zaza house and the northern houses are the most powerful group, followed by us, the southern houses. However, we wouldn’t be smiling so blissfully during a small harvest feast. Kiba meat and the vegetables from the Post Station Town are food that allows us to survive, just like air and water. We won’t feel any special joy or bliss from them.」</p>

      <p>「I see…」</p>

      <p>「Every meal gives us joy for surviving another day. The greater the joy, the stronger the will and power to survive. Asuta, that’s what you said, correct? I heard that from Donda Wu.」</p>

      <p>「Donda Wu told you that?」</p>

      <p>「Yes. Just from today, I understand how powerful the Wu clan is. At the same time, I realize the capability of the Fa house.」</p>

      <p>There was a bold smile on Dali Sauti’s squarish face.</p>

      <p>「We will be meeting the people from the Genos castle in 3 days. The denizens of Forest's Edge need to obtain even greater strength and work together. Asuta, Ai Fa, I hope the two of you can do your best for our tribe in the future too.」</p>

      <p>「Y-Yes.」</p>

      <p>「This is only natural for denizens of Forest's Edge.」</p>

      <p>After Ai Fa and I nodded in agreement, Dali Sauti turned around.</p>

      <p>「Well then, let us enjoy the dishes that the women of the Wu clan prepared for us. I will take my leave now, please stay safe.」</p>

      <p>After Dali Sauti left, another figure appeared. It wasn’t just one person, but Lala Wu, Shin Wu, and Mida.</p>

      <p>「Finally found it! Ludo, don’t take Asuta’s cooking away! I searched all over for it!」</p>

      <p>Lala Wu led the way and charged towards her brother, and then pinched his left ear with all her might. Even though Ludo Wu got the title of a brave, he still couldn’t evade the attack while holding such a big plate.</p>

      <p>「That hurts, retard! If I leave Asuta’s dish unattended, that big guy there will devour it all!」</p>

      <p>「You are as much of a glutton as Mida! Enough, hand it over!」</p>

      <p>As the siblings squabbled, Mida stared at me with his pig-like small eyes.</p>

      <p>「… Mida won’t eat all of it. Mida wants to try Asuta’s cooking too…」</p>

      <p>He didn’t make a scene like he did in the past and muttered to himself a little sullenly with his cheeks trembling.</p>

      <p>「I understand. There’s just a bit left, so eat it cherishingly, alright?」</p>

      <p>「Yes… I will cherish it…」</p>

      <p>「Tch… Hey Mida, I won’t lose to you in the next contest. So don’t lose to anyone else aside from me, okay?」</p>

      <p>「… Hmm…?」</p>

      <p>The atmosphere was harmonious.</p>

      <div class="imgBox">
        <img src="../Images/0013.png" alt="Illustration"/><!--  https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/xOXhhIEm19Jbe7mfY80oQNiJjnbZPN96QdKLwDF4vE5uzixGBc2Ij31YMt6qnlPD63E5UukoM7-CZ2Fxgfoafw6jdIry4xxXpDq9zv5FS6fVx2mIAHnUrHGrj08pl7pI500pdcgf  -->
      </div>

      <p>During the Lutim house wedding banquet, I worked behind the scenes the entire day and didn’t enjoy it with the others at all. Although I didn’t cook too much, just what was on this plate, everyone had blissful smiles as they tasted the cookings made by Mama Mia Lei, Leina Wu, and the others. It was a feast the denizens of Forest's Edge only get to enjoy every few months.</p>

      <p>Grandma Jiba was seated on a rug not far from here, surrounded by many kins. The large figure laughing heartily with ribs in both hands was definitely Dan Lutim. The small figure mimicking his posture his feet might be Rimee Wu. Two tall figures were chatting some distance away with fruit wine bottles in hand. They were probably Jiza Wu and Kaslan Lutim.</p>

      <p>Everyone was enjoying the feast. Be it man or woman, or the small number of elderly and children— the torches shone on the 70-odd kins of the Wu clan. They ate, they drank, and they celebrated life in Forest's Edge.</p>

      <p>Dali Sauti was right. Three days later, the tribal chiefs would have a meeting with the people from the Genos castle. Donda Wu intentionally held a harvest feast during such a turbulent time so they would experience the life they want to protect and the happiness that they had.</p>

      <p>「Asuta, did you eat anything?」</p>

      <p>Ai Fa glared at me with her eyes half closed.</p>

      <p>「I just grabbed a few bites when I was cooking.」</p>

      <p>「I knew it! You never learn, do you? You are always…」</p>

      <p>Ludo Wu’s cheerful voice cut off Ai Fa’s words.</p>

      <p>「Ah, Darum-nii, you are finally up. Look, this is a dish cooked by Asuta.」</p>

      <p>Ai Fa and I exchanged a look and then turned to Ludo Wu. Darum Wu pushed his brother’s petite body aside gently with the back of his palm and stood before us.</p>

      <p>「Hearth caretaker of the Fa house, I have something to say to you.」</p>

      <p>The eyes he inherited from his father had a strong light in them.</p>

      <p>Ai Fa wanted to speak, but Darum Wu stopped her and continued:</p>

      <p>「I already spoke with the head of the Fa house. Hearth caretaker… no, Asuta of the Fa house, you are next. I just want to speak with you without being disturbed by others.」</p>

      <p>「Second son of the Wu clan, are you willing to swear that you won’t hurt him?」</p>

      <p>Ai Fa interjected with a sharp voice, and Darum Wu replied quietly:</p>

      <p>「I promise. You can take my arm or leg if I break my promise. In the name of the second son of the Wu clan and as a hunter in Forest's Edge, Darum Wu hereby vows that he will not harm Asuta of the Fa house. All who hear me are my witness.」</p>

      <p>「Wait! Darum-nii, what are you saying all of a sudden!」</p>

      <p>Lala Wu yelled angrily, Ludo Wu frowned troubledly, Shin Wu remained expressionless, and Mida was the same as usual. As for Rau Lei— he glared at the side of Darum Wu’s face with hound-like eyes.</p>

      <p>「Are there any problems between you two? Never mind, I heard your vow just now. Darum Wu, if you go against your promise, I will cut off your arms.」</p>

      <p>「Whatever.」</p>

      <p>Darum Wu muttered softly.</p>

      <p>Ai Fa bit her lips tightly and looked at me. I nodded at her and looked up at the tall Darum Wu.</p>

      <p>「I understand. Where should we talk?」</p>

      <p>「Anywhere is fine, as long as no one disturbs us.」</p>

      <p>I followed the poker-faced Darum Wu out of the plaza. We went into a dark alley between two houses.</p>

      <p>It was some distance from the noise of the crowds and the torches. Darum Wu checked the surroundings for anyone hiding in the dark and then turned towards me.</p>

      <p>「Asuta of the Fa house, did you hear the promise I made with Ai Fa before our contest of might?」</p>

      <p>「Yes, I did.」</p>

      <p>「In the end, I lost to Ai Fa. I don’t have the rights to stop her anymore… Only you can stop her now.」</p>

      <p>「Stop Ai Fa?」</p>

      <p>Darum Wu’s expression was blank, but his blue eyes were burning.</p>

      <p>If Rau Lei’s eyes were like a hunting hound, then his eyes were like that of a wild wolf.</p>

      <p>「I’m not good with words, so I will just say what I think… Asuta, don’t you want to stop Ai Fa? Can you live carefree even if she withers away in the forest?」</p>

      <p>「Are you saying… that Ai Fa should give up her work as a hunter?」</p>

      <p>「Of course, what else could I mean?」</p>

      <p>His words were too unexpected.</p>

      <p>「W-Wait. Darum Wu, you are also doing the dangerous work of a hunter, correct? But you are refuting the job of a hunter?」</p>

      <p>「She is a woman. She doesn’t have the responsibility of being a hunter, unlike men. Don’t make me state such common sense.」</p>

      <p>「But Ai Fa takes pride in being a hunter. She just happens to be a woman; she has the soul of a hunter, just like you…」</p>

      <p>「That’s not important. Asuta, I want to know what you think.」</p>

      <p>With the sound of a footfall, Darum Wu took one step my way.</p>

      <p>There was no use in retreating. If Darum Wu wanted to harm me, I couldn’t evade at this distance.</p>

      <p>「Can you bear with such a fate? She might wither away in the forest tomorrow, you understand? If that happens, will you still accept the reason 『because she is a hunter』?」</p>

      <p>「That’s… Not all hunters die young in the forest. Even though Ai Fa is a woman, she is still an amazingly capable hunter…」</p>

      <p>「Hypocrite. No matter how good she is, she can’t live forever. Didn’t she suffer a heavy injury just a few days ago? If she ran into a kiba on her way home back then, she would have died.」</p>

      <p>The piercing light in his burning eyes leaned in close.</p>

      <p>I could feel his rage and regret.</p>

      <p>「Besides, she even used the dangerous 『Sacrificial hunting method』. She even went that far, just how long can she stay safe? Answer me, Asuta. If Ai Fa withers in the forest tomorrow, will you be fine with that? Is that how insignificant Ai Fa is to you?」</p>

      <p>「To me, Ai Fa is more precious than anyone else! But I… don’t want to refute her lifestyle.」</p>

      <p>「Is it fine even if you lose her? I— I don’t want to lose her!」</p>

      <p>Darum Wu could no longer suppress his voice.</p>

      <p>The scar across his right cheek turned red.</p>

      <p>「I don’t want to lose Ai Fa! I can’t bear seeing her face such a fate! So I want Ai Fa to live on as a woman! But I — I know I can’t stop her anymore.」</p>

      <p>「That’s…」</p>

      <p>「That night during the house head conference, I failed to protect Ai Fa. And today, I lost to her. I don’t have the rights to say anymore… I can’t protect her, I’m powerless now!」</p>

      <p>Darum Wu grabbed me by the chest.</p>

      <p>He was stronger than Rau Lei, and his fingers were trembling from regret.</p>

      <p>「Aren’t you going to stop Ai Fa? You are her only family… She already acknowledges you as a member of the Fa house, don’t you want to protect her?」</p>

      <p>「Of course I want to protect her! But…」</p>

      <p>How should I express my feelings?</p>

      <p>I didn’t wish Ai Fa to die. That much was obvious.</p>

      <p>However, I didn’t want to refute Ai Fa’s way of life, because…</p>

      <p>「… I want to protect Ai Fa’s feelings, thoughts, and pride. If Ai Fa wants to live as a hunter, I will protect this wish of hers.」</p>

      <p>That wasn’t it.</p>

      <p>After saying that out loud, I felt that I didn’t state the most important point.</p>

      <p>I didn’t even agree with what I said.</p>

      <p>And of course, Darum Wu looked as if he didn’t agree and pulled at my chest harder.</p>

      <p>「Then, can you bear losing Ai Fa?」</p>

      <p>「I might not be able to bear it. I might regret it for the rest of my life. But if I want to prioritize Ai Fa’s feelings and live with her, I can only steel myself for this.」</p>

      <p>Was I wrong?</p>

      <p>When the women of the Wu clan sent off their men into the woods, they did so with a resolve I couldn’t imagine. In my eyes, they cared for their family more than anyone else, but they accepted the cruel fate that their family might die at any moment. They could only trust their family, and pray for their safety.</p>

      <p>What I lacked was this resolve. And so, just like how they trusted their family… I should trust Ai Fa too. Was I wrong?</p>

      <p>「… You are very capable. In this short period of time, you have proven this point. Only you can earn copper plates by working in the Post Station Town. Hence, Ai Fa doesn’t need to work as a hunter anymore, correct?」</p>

      <p>Darum Wu grit his teeth hard as he squeezed out these words with a low and hoarse voice.</p>

      <p>So Darum Wu was so worried about Ai Fa. That was a big shock to me.</p>

      <p>That made me waver a little. The person most suited for Ai Fa… the one who could save her from this cruel fate wasn’t me, but someone like him…</p>

      <p>I…</p>

      <p>I looked quietly at Darum Wu’s twisted face.</p>

      <p>I didn’t know how much time went by… Darum Wu finally let go of my chest, and he averted his face exhaustedly.</p>

      <p>「… When Ai Fa withers away in the forest, I will take your life. Even if I die in my attempt, I will not let this matter rest.」</p>

      <p>Finally, Darum Wu turned and left with these words.</p>

      <p>I stood in place, unable to move.</p>

      <p>Darum Wu left the dark corner, and I felt a slender figure with a plate rushing over… I was probably mistaken. My senses seemed to be failing me.</p>

      <p>I could return to the bright and warm world just by advancing a few meters. The orange flame, the noise of the crowd, the heat and vigor of the feast were everywhere.</p>

      <p>But, did I have the right to return to that place? I didn’t know.</p>

      <p>Am I… just relying on the strong will of Ai Fa?</p>

      <p>Ai Fa was an outstanding hunter. She told me often that she wouldn’t throw her life easily and the proper way of the hunter was to live a long life and hunt as much kiba as possible. I believed her, and, in the end, I was relying on her.</p>

      <p>I didn’t think Ai Fa would die.</p>

      <p>I assumed that fate wouldn’t take Ai Fa away unreasonably.</p>

      <p>I didn’t understand anything.</p>

      <p>And despite not understanding, I…</p>

      <p>「Asuta, how long are you going to stay here?」</p>

      <p>I turned back in surprise.</p>

      <p>I definitely won’t mistake this voice. With the plaza dyed in reddish-orange color behind her, Ai Fa stood tall in front of me.</p>

      <p>「Ai… Ai Fa, what’s the matter?」</p>

      <p>「Do you even need to ask? I saw the second son of the Wu clan coming out, but you were still nowhere to be found, so I came to fetch you.」</p>

      <p>Ai Fa took large strides towards me with a sulking face.</p>

      <p>I backed away unconsciously, but she grabbed my arm.</p>

      <p>「Why are you running away? Why do you look so sad? You shouldn’t be affected by whatever nonsense that second son told you.」</p>

      <p>Ai Fa glanced up and down at me with angry eyes; she probably wanted to check if I suffered any violence.</p>

      <p>「… Did you eavesdrop on us earlier?」</p>

      <p>「I’m not Kamyua Yost and won’t do something so shameless. If you say something so rude again, I will make you pay for it.」</p>

      <p>「… That’s true. Sorry.」</p>

      <p>「What’s wrong? The one you are angry with isn't the second son of the Wu clan but me?」</p>

      <p>Ai Fa lowered her head a little and pouted like she usually did.</p>

      <p>As there wasn’t anyone else here, she showed her feelings freely. She looked adorable and made my heart ache at the same time too.</p>

      <p>「If you are mad at me, I will apologize. Asuta, don’t look so sad.」</p>

      <p>「Ehh? You don’t need to apologize…」</p>

      <p>「Is that so? When I lost to Dan Lutim, didn’t I vent my anger out at you?」</p>

      <p>I didn’t care about such trivial things.</p>

      <p>Even though Ai Fa always did that.</p>

      <p>「Back then, I couldn’t suppress my frustration. After calming down, I realized that despite the many restrictions of that contest, I still fought on par with Dan Lutim… who was on equal footing with Donda Wu, so it was something to be proud of.」</p>

      <p>Ai Fa smiled a little bashfully.</p>

      <p>「My father Gill taught me well. I’m now more confident that I’m a qualified hunter. I made you worried, but the contest of might is very meaningful to me.」</p>

      <p>「… I see.」</p>

      <p>「What’s the matter, aren’t you happy for me?」</p>

      <p>Ai Fa frowned again and leaned in close to me suddenly.</p>

      <p>「You are acting weird. It’s rare to see you show such a pained gaze. Asuta, I already told you to not hide anything from me.」</p>

      <p>「… That might be so, but some things are hard to say.」</p>

      <p>Ai Fa seemed peeved by my answer.</p>

      <p>She then said: 「Don’t wanna.」</p>

      <p>Instead of 「You can’t」, it was 「Don’t wanna」.</p>

      <p>The subtle change in her tone was her childish side she would show every now and then.</p>

      <p>「I earned my pride as a hunter, and your cooking skills got acknowledged by Donda Wu once again. Your eyes can’t be so sad on this joyous day.」</p>

      <p>「Even if you say that…」</p>

      <p>「Don’t wanna, don’t wanna.」</p>

      <p>Ai Fa clutched my fingers tightly with hers.</p>

      <p>「Somehow, I feel that you are so far away. No, not simply far away… I feel as if you are going to disappear.」</p>

      <p>Ai Fa walked towards me with an anxious face.</p>

      <p>「I already told you. Asuta, I won’t permit you to disappear in front of me.」</p>

      <p>「…」</p>

      <p>「You are my irreplaceable family. If you are gone… I won’t be able to hold on too.」</p>

      <p>I could feel Ai Fa’s breath on my face.</p>

      <p>Her sweet fragrance tickled my nasal cavity.</p>

      <p>I could feel the warmth from her fingertips.</p>

      <p>「… If I made you uncomfortable, I apologize.」</p>

      <p>Ai Fa said quietly, relaxed her fingers, and then hugged me from the front.</p>

      <p>「Stay by my side forever. I will promise to accompany for the rest of my life too.」</p>

      <p>Ai Fa’s arms circled around my back and hugged me tightly, and I felt that I was going to be crushed.</p>

      <p>Although I couldn’t hug her back equally hard, my arms still went around her back quietly.</p>

      <p>「If you permit it, I want to stay by your side too.」</p>

      <p>「What are you saying? I’m the one who wants us to be together forever.」</p>

      <p>I realized one thing.</p>

      <p>I liked how Ai Fa was right now.</p>

      <p>Be it her pride as a hunter, her stubbornness, her childlike fragileness, her kindness hidden behind her acting difficult — I liked everything about Ai Fa.</p>

      <p>I didn’t want to lose her.</p>

      <p>If possible, I hoped she wouldn’t do anything dangerous.</p>

      <p>But what I really wanted… was for Ai Fa to never change.</p>

      <p>If Ai Fa could transfer her pride and conviction to a work other than a hunter, I would give her my heartfelt blessing… But since living as a hunter brought Ai Fa the most happiness, I had to support her and protect her instead of refuting her.</p>

      <p>That was the only thing that I could promise for now. With that in mind, I finally hugged Ai Fa tightly.</p>

      <p>After about 15 seconds, Ai Fa complained: 「It hurts.」</p>

      <p>And so, the 27th of the Blue Month, on the 64th day since I arrived in this world, with the thoughts of many people entangled in my fingers, I spent a quiet night.</p>
