Chapter 44 <br/>
 <br/>
Naofumi: "UWAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAH!" <br/>
 <br/>
I unleashed a roar which rivalled the dragon's and caught the arm of the shadow with the shield. <br/>
I don't feel pain or anything else. <br/>
 <br/>
Zombie Dragon: "GYA!?" <br/>
 <br/>
The black shadow mouth distorts in astonishment and sneered at me. <br/>
Ridiculous. <br/>
 <br/>
Naofumi: "DIE!" <br/>
 <br/>
I caught the black shadow and throw it. <br/>
The black shadow flew while roaring in surprise. <br/>
 <br/>
Zombie Dragon: "GYAOOOOO!" <br/>
 <br/>
However, the shadow gets up immediately and rushed to attack. <br/>
…… Can this shield attack an enemy? <br/>
Not available. <br/>
The black shadow attacks me with its tail and arms, knocking me to my knees. <br/>
 <br/>
Naofumi: "It's not working!" <br/>
 <br/>
The attack of the black shadow is not effective on me. <br/>
 <br/>
Naofumi: "Haha…… Are you stupid?" <br/>
 <br/>
Though, I don't have any means to defeat it. <br/>
After that thought, a black flame immediately appeared around my arm and it burned the tail and arms of the black shadow. <br/>
 <br/>
Zombie Dragon: "GYAOO!?" <br/>
 <br/>
The shadow was surprised at that fact and fell down. <br/>
 <br/>
Naofumi: "Hm…… Is there a counter-attack offensive ability in here?" <br/>
 <br/>
The shadow is keeping its distance, seemingly afraid. <br/>
 <br/>
Naofumi: "Are you begging for your life now? It's too late for forgiveness!" <br/>
 <br/>
I slowly recite a skill. <br/>
 <br/>
Naofumi: "Iron Maiden!" <br/>
 <br/>
However, the skill is not activated and a skill tree appeared in my view. <br/>
Shield Prison -> Change Shield (Attack) -> Iron Maiden <br/>
Is this the activation conditions? <br/>
That’s troublesome, I suppose to trigger the counter-attack, I have to trick the shadow into hitting me. <br/>
 <br/>
Naofumi: "Wait for me……I'll kill you by any means possible……" <br/>
 <br/>
The shadow swings its arm at me, frightened by my murderous intent and anger. <br/>
My shield was raised to intercept the arm and a black flame engulfed it. <br/>
It roasted the meat and melted the bone. <br/>
This amount of heat is insufficient…… I want to erase the existence itself. <br/>
 <br/>
Zombie Dragon: "-----------OT!" <br/>
 <br/>
I see… The angrier I get, the more powerful the Shield of Fury get. <br/>
 <br/>
That's simple. <br/>
 <br/>
All I have to do is remember my feelings for those bastards. <br/>
Mein = Sofia…… Or was her name Malty? <br/>
I feel angry just remembering that name. <br/>
Next is Trash king, Motoyasu, Ren, and Itsuki. <br/>
I remember the things they did to me one by one. <br/>
Hate…… I want to kill them…… <br/>
My anger begins to dissolve into the crimson shield, staining it black. <br/>
 <br/>
Naofumi: "This time I'll kill…… Everyone……" <br/>
 <br/>
I catch the arm of the shadow and everything is erased, exterminated by the flames of indignation. <br/>
The flame wrapped around the entire shadow and consumes it all. <br/>
 <br/>
Somebody touches my hand. <br/>
Dokun…… <br/>
This is…… The same gentle feeling as that time? <br/>
 <br/>
Raphtalia: "I am different from the whole world which tortures and shuns Naofumi-sama…… I'll say it as many times as it takes, Naofumi-sama won't do something like that." <br/>
 <br/>
……Eh? <br/>
My visibility warped by darkness slightly shakes. <br/>
Somewhere inside of me, a voice is warning me that if I give in to the anger, I will lose what’s most precious to me. <br/>
I want to deny it. But…… <br/>
 <br/>
Raphtalia: "Please believe me. I am convinced that Naofumi-sama didn't commit any crime. You are a great Hero of the Shield-sama who gave me medicine to save my life and taught me how to live…… I am your sword and I will follow you no matter what road you take." <br/>
 <br/>
A voice whispered to me. <br/>
Don't be consumed by the urge to kill. <br/>
There is something you must protect. <br/>
 <br/>
Did you forget your anger? <br/>
I did not forget, but I want to repay the person who so sincerely believes in me. <br/>
 <br/>
Do you defy me? <br/>
Do not order me. I will decide for myself! <br/>
 <br/>
…… I am always here, waiting for an opening…… <br/>
 <br/>
The black voice disappears and my view becomes bright. <br/>
 <br/>
Raphtalia: "Cough! Cough!" <br/>
 <br/>
When I noticed, Raphtalia was holding my hand while trying to hold down her coughing. <br/>
 <br/>
Naofumi: "Ar-Are you okay?" <br/>
 <br/>
She had suffered terrible burns. <br/>
There is no enemy here that can use fire. <br/>
Just… What… <br/>
Ah…… <br/>
Special effect of the Shield of Fury, Self-Burning Curse. <br/>
 <br/>
Naofumi: "Raphtalia!" <br/>
Raphtalia: "Coug-" <br/>
 <br/>
Raphtalia smiles and collapses. <br/>
Because of me… Raphtalia suffered serious wounds. <br/>
 <br/>
Naofumi: "I am the Hero of the Shield who commands the origin of power. I have read and deciphered a law of nature. I call forth the power of nature to heal!" <br/>
Naofumi: "Fast Heal!" <br/>
 <br/>
Naofumi: "I am the Hero of the Shield who commands the origin of power. I have read and deciphered a law of nature. I call forth the power of nature to heal!" <br/>
Naofumi: "Fast Heal!" <br/>
 <br/>
Naofumi: "I am the Hero of the Shield who commands the origin of power. I have read and deciphered a law of nature. I call forth the power of nature to heal!" <br/>
Naofumi: "Fast Heal!" <br/>
 <br/>
Until my magic power run out, I did not stop healing. <br/>
Raphtalia… Raphtalia is the only person who believed in me! <br/>
There are severe burns. Using beginner class recovery magic is insufficient for treatment. <br/>
I must hurry to the wagon and use the healing ointments. <br/>
 <br/>
Zombie Dragon: "GYAOOOOO!" <br/>
 <br/>
I turned around and saw the zombie dragon roar. It faces us and uses its breathe while attacking with its un-burnt arm. <br/>
 <br/>
Naofumi: "Get out of my way!" <br/>
 <br/>
I intercept the zombie dragon's attack by raising my arm. <br/>
The shield shines with a black light and activates Self-Curse Burning. <br/>
 <br/>
Naofumi: "Stop it!" <br/>
 <br/>
The shield stopped as if responding to my voice. <br/>
If the shield activates again here, it will also burn Raphtalia. <br/>
I cannot do such a thing. However, the poison breath is very bad for Raphtalia's vitality. <br/>
 <br/>
As if in response to my intentions, the shield burns only the poison breath. But this output is not enough to earnestly slaughter the enemy. <br/>
What should I do? <br/>
The urge to kill and anger is always supplied to me from the shield, I try to hold it down somehow as to not be swallowed by rage again. <br/>
My highest priority now is to return to the wagon quickly and treat Raphtalia. <br/>
Protecting Raphtalia is all that's left of my reasoning. <br/>
 <br/>
Zombie Dragon: "GYA!?" <br/>
 <br/>
While in the midst of attacking and defending, the zombie dragon begins scratching at its chest painfully. <br/>
 <br/>
Naofumi: "Wh-what is going on……" <br/>
 <br/>
What on earth is happening? Is the Self-Curse Burning burning it from the inside? <br/>
 <br/>
Zombie Dragon: "GYAOOOOOOOO!!!" <br/>
 <br/>
Eventually, the dragon stops moving and returned to its original corpse form. <br/>
Now is not the time to observe the situation. <br/>
There seem to be no more poison flies buzzing around. <br/>
They probably escaped as a result of the zombie dragon's rampage. <br/>
I returned to the wagon with Raphtalia and rub the burn cure made from healing ointments and medical herbs on Raphtalia's burns. <br/>
And an antidote was given to Raphtalia. <br/>
 <br/>
Raphtalia: "Ah…… Naofumi-sama" <br/>
 <br/>
Raphtalia's breathing becomes quiet and opens her eyes to smile at me. <br/>
 <br/>
Naofumi: "Are you okay!?" <br/>
Raphtalia: "Yeah…… Thank you for the medicine Naofumi-sama……" <br/>
 <br/>
Still, her burns are quite severe. Though the simple burns were cured with the medicine…… Because the effect was from black magic, a black trace is left. Though it's a little better, a complete recovery seems unlikely. <br/>
 <br/>
Raphtalia: "I-I'm fine…Hurry…the dragon" <br/>
Naofumi: "The zombie dragon isn't moving anymore" <br/>
Raphtalia: "That's not it…… dispose of the corpse quickly." <br/>
Naofumi: "…… Okay." <br/>
 <br/>
Raphtalia's strong gaze was directed at the corpse of the dragon. <br/>
 <br/>
Naofumi:"Is it safe to leave it here?" <br/>
Raphtalia:"If it gets up again, we have no way to fight it." <br/>
Naofumi:"I see…… Okay." <br/>
 <br/>
I got off the wagon and walked towards to corpse of the dragon. <br/>
It is necessary to dismantle the dragon and then let my shield absorb it. <br/>
And Firo…… even if it's only a corpse, I have to at least make a grave. <br/>
 <br/>
When approaching the corpse, I noticed its internal organs were wriggling. <br/>
What on earth is going to happen? <br/>
I can barely fight in this state. <br/>
Shield of fury…… <br/>
It's a dangerous shield that erodes the mind, but it provides strong physical defence and a strong counter attack. <br/>
I still haven't recovered from when I used it earlier, so I changed to the Chimeric Viper Shield. <br/>
But I get ready to respond to anything while taking a stance. <br/>
And I approach the corpse. <br/>
The wriggling stops in one place, it’s getting eaten? The chest is broken and something appeared! <br/>
 <br/>
Firo: "Puhaa~!" <br/>
 <br/>
A familiar bird that was dripping with rotten liquid walked out of the corpse of the dragon. <br/>
 <br/>
Firo: "Fu.....Finally Firo is out" <br/>
Naofumi: "Firo? Are you safe? Are you not injured?" <br/>
Firo: "Yup. Firo doesn't feel hurt." <br/>
Naofumi: "Then…… What about the blood that came out when you were eaten? <br/>
Firo: "Blood? Firo threw up all the food inside the dragon." <br/>
 <br/>
Did Firo eat the red fruit that resembles tomatoes……? Is that why It looked like blood was dripping? <br/>
She certainly was eating before the battle. <br/>
 <br/>
Naofumi: "Don't scare me like that! I thought you died!" <br/>
Firo: "An attack of that level is not even painful,Firo isn't even itchy." <br/>
 <br/>
Is this a bird or a monster? <br/>
No, it is in fact a demon. <br/>
Honestly…… I am surprised. <br/>
 <br/>
Firo: "Master, were you worried about Firo?" <br/>
Naofumi: "I don't know." <br/>
Firo: "Master is embarrassed~" <br/>
Naofumi: "Do I have to kill you myself this time?" <br/>
Firo: "Noo~" <br/>
 <br/>
Sigh…… She's safe, that's great. <br/>
I'm angry at the smirking Firo though. I'll remember this. <br/>
 <br/>
Naofumi: "So what did you do?" <br/>
Firo: "Oh right. There was a big crystal that shined purple inside the stomach of the dragon. So Firo tore it up and it stopped." <br/>
Naofumi: "Hmm......" <br/>
 <br/>
What does that mean? <br/>
Was the foundation of that zombie dragon the big crystal? <br/>
The place where Firo came out……the heart? <br/>
But, such a thing…… <br/>
Because it's a dragon…? Did the magic that stay in the body all gather in the heart and crystallize? <br/>
That might be possible. <br/>
 <br/>
Naofumi: "So… The crystal? <br/>
Firo: "Geffuuuuu!" <br/>
 <br/>
Yup. She ate it…… I want to smack this fellow…… <br/>
 <br/>
Firo: "Firo left a little. A souvenir for Master" <br/>
 <br/>
After saying so, Firo passes me a small purple fragment. <br/>
…… What can I do with this? <br/>
First, I'll let the shield absorb half. <br/>
As I thought, the amount of skill trees unlocked and level is insufficient. <br/>
 <br/>
Naofumi: "Because Raphtalia is hurt, Firo dispose of the corpse with me. <br/>
Firo: "Okay~!" <br/>
 <br/>
Honestly…… This bird really surprises me. <br/>
I watch Firo and think. <br/>
At that time, if I didn't give in to the anger. <br/>
After I changed the shield to defeat an enemy for Firo, I completely lost to the anger after that. <br/>
If Raphtalia did not stop me, I might have even burned Firo. <br/>
Anger...... The shield which was cursed. <br/>
Were you trying to take over the consciousness of the hero? <br/>
All that I can say is, it gave me an uncontrollable urge to kill. <br/>
……At that time, that was all I could think about. <br/>
 <br/>
Firo: "Itadakimasu!" <br/>
Naofumi: "Hey Firo, don't eat that meat! It’s Rotten!" <br/>
Firo: "Meat that's about to go bad is the most delicious, Master~!" <br/>
Naofumi: "This one isn't going bad, it's completely rotten!" <br/>
 <br/>
And without any tension, the zombie dragon was disposed of. <br/>
Though, I couldn't level any skill trees with the bone and meat of the dragon. <br/>
Still, the dragon zombie's skin and dragon's bone seem to be useful so I'll put in the wagon.
