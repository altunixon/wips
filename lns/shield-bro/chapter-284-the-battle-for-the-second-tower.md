Chapter 284: The Battle for the Second Tower<br/>
Hmm? The slaves that had split off into a separate regiment are approaching the central portion as well.<br/>
I change the channel.<br/>
"Kiel-kun!"<br/>
The slaves close in to find Kiel waiting for them, taking on an imposing stance.<br/>
"Move aside!" (Imya)<br/>
Oh? Imya’s mixed in with the group.<br/>
I’m surprised she came. She admitted herself that she was unfit for battle.<br/>
"I’m sorry, but you’re not getting past! I promised Niichan." (Kiel)<br/>
Kiel changes to her dog form, and the other slaves raise their various weapons.<br/>
"Even if it’s Kiel-kun, I won’t hold back. In the end, it’s all for Shield-Oniichan’s sake."<br/>
"You’re wrong everyone. Everyone’s misunderstanding something. Niichan… Niichan granted me power. If you all ask, then you too will…" (Kiel)<br/>
Kiel jumps forward and starts biting at the slaves.<br/>
However, perhaps due to the fact that they’re used to battle, the group is able to keep up with her movements.<br/>
The slaves with the highest levels work together and feign attacks at her.<br/>
They must be trying to wear down her stamina.<br/>
"…Then there’s no choice. Niichan told me not to use it if possible, but I’ll show you my serious face!" (Kiel)<br/>
WAAAOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOON!<br/>
Kiel roars to the sky, and her form begins changing once more.<br/>
Magic surrounds her, so all that is seen is a black silhouette. The sound of her bones creaking sounds out, as her form warps and changes.<br/>
"Ah… aaaah…"<br/>
Upon seeing the black shadow, a majority of the attacking slaves begin shaking.<br/>
Only Imya manages to remain calm.<br/>
"Hah… hah… How is it! This is my new power!" (Kiel)<br/>
Kiel shouts out in an excited voice.<br/>
Her form is now that of a dog with three heads. That of Cerberus, the guardian of hell.<br/>
But the problem is that her form isn’t particularly large. Since the base is Kiel, it still looks like a puppy… no, it’s a wolf cub-like Cerberus.<br/>
Perhaps it would be best not to call it Cerberus, but Kielberus. Looking from afar, its outer appearance is still relatively cute.<br/>
(TL: This pun isn’t in the original; instead, Naofumi says Cerberus in Hiragana instead of Katakana, downgrading the name’s effect. I’m not sure how to convey that in English)<br/>
(ED: Perhaps it would be better to call her <3Cerberus<3 XD)<br/>
This is the form Kiel wished for.<br/>
"I’m coming! Prepare yourself!" (Kiel)<br/>
"Wah! Stay away! Get away, stop!"<br/>
"Father! Mamaaaa!"<br/>
(TL: Remember, the thing that assaulted the village was…)<br/>
The villagers run around in panic.<br/>
"Everyone, get down!" (Imya)<br/>
Imya runs forward and stabs at Kiel with a dagger.<br/>
Kiel grumbles as the dagger stabs into her shoulder.<br/>
"If it isn’t Imya-chan. You don’t find me scary?" (Kiel)<br/>
"No, not really…" (Imya)<br/>
… It seems Imya’s surprisingly fearless.<br/>
Though, I agree that Kiel isn’t really scary.<br/>
No matter how I look at it, she’s cute.<br/>
"Kiel-kun, you told me this on the day I was bought, right? The place I was going to would be somewhere where if you work hard, you’ll get appropriate compensation. Is it still the same?" (Imya)<br/>
"Of course!" (Kiel)<br/>
"It doesn’t look that way to me. That’s why I want the Hero of the Shield-sama to come back. Kiel-kun, I will defeat you!" (Imya)<br/>
Then, Imya produces a cookie from her pocket and throws it.<br/>
(TL: The Trojan Aeneas was able to pacify Cerberus with drugged cake.)<br/>
"S-sweets!?" (Kiel)<br/>
Kiel suddenly turns her attention to the thrown treat. She chases it and begins chomping on it.<br/>
"Everyone, now! Calm down; collect yourselves!" (Imya)<br/>
Imya claps her hands on one of the panicking slave’s faces.<br/>
"B-but that monster’s here! We have to escape… we have…"<br/>
… This reaction. It’s somewhat like Raphtalia’s panic attacks when she was younger.<br/>
Ah… I see why Kiel wanted to take on that shape.<br/>
She thought something like strength = evoking fear. She turned into what she feared to obtain strength.<br/>
However, it seems that Imya coincidentally noticed her weakness…<br/>
Did Ren and Itsuki tell her tales of the other world? Or is it chance?<br/>
The monster Cerberus lives in this world, so perhaps it has similar qualities.<br/>
I thought the same when I finished the modifications.<br/>
"If we don’t do anything here, what do you think will happen? Didn’t we get stronger as not to lose to the wave!?" (Imya)<br/>
"… Right, not to lose… We’re working so we won’t have to lose any precious people anymore!"<br/>
"I was scolded by Imya-chan, haha!"<br/>
"Kiel-kun! We won’t lose!" (Everyone)<br/>
"Hah! Like I’m going down so easily!" (Kiel)<br/>
Kiel finishes munching on the cookie and starts running at the slaves.<br/>
She’s really fast.<br/>
As expected of my modifications.<br/>
She’s making a fool out of the villagers!<br/>
"Ku! She’s too fast. At this rate, we’ll never get through!"<br/>
"GAUUU!" (Kiel)<br/>
Kiel snaps at Imya with one of her mouths.<br/>
"___!"<br/>
Overcoming the pain, Imya grabs and holds down the other two heads.<br/>
"Now’s your chance!" (Imya)<br/>
"Yeah!"<br/>
… What is this?<br/>
The slaves have begun singing a lullaby.<br/>
Dammit! How do they know all of Kiel’s weaknesses!?<br/>
(TL: The Hero Orpheus was able to get past him by putting him to sleep with his lyre. Also see Fluffy from Harry Potter. )<br/>
"Ah… Uu…"<br/>
Kiel’s jaw slackens, and she staggers from side to side.<br/>
"Uu… Not yet, I am… not done yet! Like I’d go down here!" (Kiel)<br/>
… I guess it’s time.<br/>
I open the line and connect it to Kiel’s room.<br/>
"Kiel, retreat." (Naofumi)<br/>
"Niichan!? But…" (Kiel)<br/>
"They know your weaknesses. At this rate, you’ll definitely lose. Just fall back for now." (Naofumi)<br/>
"Damn! Understood, Niichan." (Kiel)<br/>
Dammit… I never expected the situation to be this bad.<br/>
I showed off my massive modification of the Bioplant. Were they able to deduce Kiel’s modifications from that?<br/>
And the monster that should have been a traumatic existence for a majority of them… Did they already prepare to overcome such a hurdle beforehand?<br/>
That’s the only thing I can think of.<br/>
Kiel obeys me and leaves the room with haste.<br/>
I told him to go assist Motoyasu if something like this happened.<br/>
With his increased fighting ability, if he goes to assist Motoyasu, then something should change.<br/>
At that moment, the alarm rings once more.<br/>
From the second tower’s core piece, someone’s accessing all of the other towers’ cores. He’s trying to shut them all down.<br/>
I see… So that’s why Rat participated in this mission.<br/>
But that’s futile.<br/>
"Rafu~!"<br/>
The monster I had prepared as a final line of defense, Mii-kun, breaks through the ceiling to confront the hacker.<br/>
Some bugs were apparent when he sparred with Firo, so I didn’t want to send him into combat so soon. But, I stationed him above the core room just in case.<br/>
That’s the place where the land’s power and magic gathers. It was perfect for tuning him. I’m lucky I placed him there.<br/>
"Ku… I was so close…" (Rat)<br/>
"Unfortunately, your efforts are fruitless." (Naofumi)<br/>
I connect my speaker to speak with Rat.<br/>
"Do you think that is enough to breach through my security?" (Naofumi)<br/>
"Marquis, just quit it already!" (Rat)<br/>
"Hahaha, I’ll make you regret ever thinking of opposing me. Go forth!" (Naofumi)<br/>
How ironic. Rat, you shall be disposed of by the monster you cherished so!<br/>
"Rafu~!"<br/>
Mii-kun swings his thick tail at Rat.<br/>
Being familiar with monsters, Rat predicts and evades his attack. She throws a syringe at him.<br/>
Again, useless. Don’t think that’s enough to stop a fully strengthened Raph.<br/>
"The drug isn’t…"<br/>
Rat freezes as if she had seen something unbelievable. Her movements are quickly limited by Mii-kun.<br/>
Mii-kun pulls out the syringe and starts walking toward his former friend.<br/>
"Rafu~!"<br/>
He raises his large arm and lowers it with great force.<br/>
"Agu…"<br/>
It’s a narrow room at the center of the tower with various devices set everywhere.<br/>
Rat’s knees give out below her, and she falls to the floor. Mii-kun raises his arm overhead, as if to give the finishing blow.<br/>
"… Rafu~"<br/>
Mii-kun and Rat exchange glances.<br/>
"… Mii-kun?"<br/>
"R-Rafu~!?"<br/>
It happened at a moment’s notice.<br/>
Mii-kun grasps his head and cries out.<br/>
Ku… I guess his body’s tuning is still inadequate.<br/>
"Marquis! What is the meaning of this!?" (Rat)<br/>
"No idea. It’s what your precious monster wished for." (Naofumi)<br/>
"Even so… you went and did something like this…!? " (Rat)<br/>
"Rafu~!"<br/>
Mii-kun starts going out of control, and the core room begins crumbling to pieces.<br/>
Ku… This is exceedingly troublesome.<br/>
Eventually, with the sound of shattering glass, the core piece breaks.<br/>
The tower rumbles and begins to collapse.<br/>
There’s no choice.<br/>
I open all audio lines in the second tower.<br/>
"Those who follow me, the tower is crumbling. Retreat with haste. If you run to the third tower, the fakes will be unable to follow." (Naofumi)<br/>
I change the channel to observe the Fake and Firo’s battle. It seems it was put on standby due to the rumbling of the tower.<br/>
They haven’t defeated her yet?<br/>
I guess the fake’s got some skills.<br/>
Due to Kiel’s help, Motoyasu was able to drive off Ren and Gaelion. They were heading to assist Firo’s group.<br/>
They join up with Sadina on the way. I guess I’ll have to honestly admit defeat here.<br/>
After I order him to return, Mii-kun takes a last look at Rat and climbs through the ceiling to escape.<br/>
"Mii-kun! Wait!" (Rat)<br/>
"… Rafu~!"<br/>
That isn’t the Mii-kun you know anymore.<br/>
He’s been reborn as one of my subordinates.<br/>
After that, Rat walks out of the room to meet the fake.<br/>
At the same time, Motoyasu meets Firo’s group and uses his portal to teleport them away.<br/>
The last footage I see before the tower collapses is that of Ren and Itsuki meeting the fake and teleporting all of them back…<br/>
It seems Itsuki’s getting over his curse. His SP recovered a bit.<br/>
That’s bothersome.<br/>
Anyways, we lost the battle of the second tower.<br/>
I have to admit that.<br/>
<br/>
