Imperial Year 851, August 12th. Evening——<br/>
The Fourth Army formed up on the eastern hill. They had 500 cavalry and 4,000 infantry.<br/>
To intercept them, the First Army set up formation at the foot of the hill. 1,000 cavalry and 10,000 infantry.<br/>
Be it numbers, training or equipment, the First Army had the upper hand.<br/>
However, the gallant victories the Fourth Army won in the High Britannian War had already spread across the entire Empire.<br/>
Although Latreille would be coronated as the new emperor tomorrow, the imperial capital Versailles was shrouded in a tense atmosphere.<br/>
The Fourth Army Headquarters——<br/>
Eric, the escort rifleman asked:<br/>
"Your Highness, what should we do?<br/>
Altina stood on the hill and stared down the First Army.<br/>
"Charge them!"<br/>
"Ehhh!?"<br/>
"—— If I said that, I can imagine Regis’ face as he tries his very best to stop me. If he was here, he would definitely object to this."<br/>
"That might be so… After all, battling the First Army is too rash. And we don’t have the proper rationale to support our campaign too right?"<br/>
"If they didn’t have a guilty conscience, why did they make such a big fuss and mobilize their troops?"<br/>
"No no, we are the ones who brought an army here in the first place."<br/>
"Then I will question Latreille by myself!"<br/>
"Please don’t do that!"<br/>
Eric pleaded with a screech, then spoke bluntly.<br/>
"Erm… Princess, that would be reckless. If Field Marshall Latreille was unscrupulous, this will be akin to putting one’s head in the lion's mouth."<br/>
"I know."<br/>
While Altina was talking to Eric, two men walked towards the headquarters.<br/>
There was Eddie who had the title of Emperor Sword, and Abidal Evra, the leader of the Flying Sparrow Knights.<br/>
Although Eddie was assigned to stay at the fort, he had his own ideas about it and led the infantry that set off later and caught up with Altina.<br/>
"Yo!" He raised a hand in greeting.<br/>
"Argentina, how long do you plan to face off against them?"<br/>
"That’s what we are discussing. Eric said I can’t go question Latreille alone."<br/>
"Isn’t that obvious? How can we send out the top commander out of the blue. At times like this, a messenger would normally be despatched."<br/>
Altina opened her eyes wide.<br/>
"That surprised me… Eddie, you actually gave a proper opinion!?"<br/>
"I had some experience on the battlefield after all… Sigh, your words seem to imply you are looking down at me?"<br/>
Abidal Evra lowered his head.<br/>
"My terrible apologies. It is an 8 days journey from Fort Volks to the capital… I should have expected such a situation and proposed a way forward."<br/>
We had 8 days of time, so why couldn’t we decide on a plan? —— Altina reproached herself too.<br/>
"Hmmm… If Latreille mobilize his army, we will retaliate, how about that?"<br/>
Eric sighed.<br/>
"How can we attack them all of a sudden?"<br/>
"During civil war, it is common for both sides to remain at an impasse."<br/>
Eddie nodded in agreement.<br/>
Altina pouted:<br/>
"T-Then there is nothing we can do!? I never fought a civil war before."<br/>
"I don’t have experience either…"<br/>
In the eyes of the cautious Eric, Altina’s action lacked careful thought and was full of risk.<br/>
That might be so, as an escort, he should avoid raising opinions that run contrary to the commander. And he couldn’t think of any good ideas like Regis…<br/>
Eric shut his mouth.<br/>
Normally, Regis would control the flow of conversation at such a moment… But their discussion right now was running amok like an unreined wild horse.<br/>
At this moment, Eddie caught the tail of that horse.<br/>
"Anyway, I think we should send a messenger first?"<br/>
"Is that enough? Then we will send one… who should we send?"<br/>
Altina asked for the other’s opinion.<br/>
Eddie took a step backwards.<br/>
"Not me. It will be a different story if this is a part of Regis’ plan, but Latreille seem to have a personal vendetta against me."<br/>
"That’s true. You are the one who escaped hand in hand from the palace with Auguste."<br/>
"Ehh… That’s true."<br/>
Why are two grown men acting like this? —— Eric thought in his heart.<br/>
Although the First Prince Auguste was actually the Fifth Princess Felicia in disguise, so this wasn’t an act between two men.<br/>
Not even the staff officers knew about the disguise. Eric only knew because he had seen through Felicia’s crossdressing disguise.<br/>
Leaving that aside, Eric pointed out other issues.<br/>
"If we send Duke Eddie Fabio de Balzac who is famed as the best swordsman in the Empire, the other party might not be able to know if he is a messenger or to seek a one on one duel…"<br/>
"No no, I don’t kill people."<br/>
Eddie hated blood flowing.<br/>
He didn’t want to kill.<br/>
Even so, he didn’t want to be killed either.<br/>
Hence, he trained and obtained powerful skills to suppressed others without dying or killing the other party. This was also thanks to his talent and the prowess of ‘Defendre Sept’.<br/>
Altina crossed her arms.<br/>
"I won’t let Eddie challenge them to duels!"<br/>
"No, I mean Field Marshall Latreille’s side might misunderstand…"<br/>
"If it’s a duel, then I should go!"<br/>
"I already said you can’t!"<br/>
Telling a commander ‘no’ was overstepping his boundaries, an action taboo for escorts—— Despite that, Eric had to say it.<br/>
Altina waved her hand.<br/>
"I-I get it. I have grown a lot too, and know that I can’t start a civil war without a proper rationale to support it."<br/>
"Please consider it seriously. The sun is going to set."<br/>
"Who do think should go, Eric?"<br/>
"... If you give the word, I will be happy to oblige."<br/>
That won’t do, Eddie shook his head.<br/>
"Eric is the escort officer, how can you leave the commander’s side."<br/>
"That’s…"<br/>
"And Argentina likes you a lot. If you are despatched as a messenger and get killed by the other side, the commander will lose her cool. We can’t allow that."<br/>
"L-Like!?"<br/>
"Don’t you spend a lot of time with her and Clarisse, and even act just like a maid?"<br/>
"I-I’m a man!?"<br/>
"Hahaha… That’s true, but I can’t help feeling this way."<br/>
"P-Please don’t say that, Lord Eddie."<br/>
He wished that Eddie wouldn’t touch the core question so nonchalantly.<br/>
Eric wiped away his cold sweat.<br/>
Altina tilted her head.<br/>
"Hmm—…… If we are sending a messenger, what should we tell Latreille? Question him ‘Did you kill Regis?’... What do we do if he says ‘I didn’t’?"<br/>
Eddie shrugged.<br/>
"If he said he didn’t, doesn’t mean he didn’t?"<br/>
"That won’t do at all!"<br/>
"Then what will you do, Argentina? Are you are certain he is lying?"<br/>
"Well…"<br/>
Altina fell into deep thought.<br/>
She led her army here on the spur of the moment, but didn’t even think about how she would question Latreille.<br/>
Eric held his head.<br/>
"Ahh, if only Sir Regis is here…"<br/>
"That’s right, if only Regis is here! But, he claims Regis is dead with just a lousy piece of paper… That’s unbelievable right!?"<br/>
"That’s… true…"<br/>
"He is a one of a kind strategist. The hero that saved the Empire… How did it turn out this way, Prince Latreille?"<br/>
Eddie sighed.<br/>
The battle of Grebauvar fortress city was a siege which they won. Even though their headquarters wasn’t assaulted, Regis who was a strategist died in battle—— It was natural to feel this was an assassination.<br/>
Suddenly, Abidal Evra pointed to the north<br/>
"Hmm? An infantry unit is approaching our flank…? Could it be a sneak attack!?"<br/>
"What!?"<br/>
Altina looked over hurriedly.<br/>
A unit was indeed heading towards them while kicking up a dust storm. They numbered about 700.<br/>
It wasn’t too numerous, but they couldn’t be ignored either.<br/>
If their flank was attacked and the soldiers fell into confusion, they would be routed if the First Army used this chance to charge them.<br/>
However, their frontlines would be thinned if they send too many troops to the wings.<br/>
Altina’s mind was a mess.<br/>
"Ugh~ Send 700 infantry to intercept!"<br/>
"We are matching their numbers!? Your Highness, our formation will crumble if they break through our flanks!"<br/>
When she heard Abidal Evra’s advice, she reconsidered.<br/>
"Twice the number then."<br/>
"1,400 it is, understood. We will draw 400 men from the unit at the front!"<br/>
"Yes!"<br/>
"Wait!" Eddie shouted.<br/>
"It doesn’t look like a surprise attack."<br/>
"Eh?"<br/>
On second glance, that unit was hoisting a white flag.<br/>
Surrender. Or maybe, a messenger.<br/>
Eric felt troubled and said:<br/>
"What is going on? It is hard to imagine sending 700 men to be messengers."<br/>
"And they seem to be mercenaries?"<br/>
Eddie muttered. He had great eyesight.<br/>
After they came closer, Altina could tell from their equipment too. Their weapons and armour were a chaotic mixture, not like an imperial unit.<br/>
"They do… look like mercenaries?"<br/>
"In that case, we can’t let our guard down even if they have a white flag."<br/>
Abidal Evra remarked.<br/>
There were many mercenaries that acted just like bandits.<br/>
On the battlefield, it was prohibited to launch a surprise attack after raising a white flag or pretending to be casualties.<br/>
However, bandits wouldn’t care about such rules. They didn’t belong to the military, and was a criminal organization.<br/>
"... No."<br/>
Altina said softly.<br/>
Though she didn’t understand why, her mind was filled with a strange sense of nostalgia. <br/>
"... Could it be, Regis?"<br/>
Ehh!? The people around her yelped in surprise.<br/>
Shortly after, they realized that Altina’s instinct proved to be correct.<br/>
