Chapter 1: Interrogation<br/>
<br/>
1<br/>
And so, after finishing our chores, we set off from the Wu clan village.<br/>
Because of our numbers, we couldn’t use the wagons. The nine conference participants, Zuro Tsun’s family of seven and ten guards, add up to a grand total of 26 person.<br/>
The nine participants include the three tribal chiefs Donda Wu, Graff Zaza, Dali Sauti, as well as Kaslan Lutim, head of the Fou house, head of the Bemu house, Ai Fa, Barcia and me.<br/>
The seven people that Pyschkurewuss wants to hold a trial over were Zuro Tsun, Diga, Doddo, Mida, Yamiel Lei, Aura, Zwei.<br/>
The escorts includes Darum Wu, Ludo Wu, Dan Lutim, Rau Lei and an elite team handpicked from the Zaza, Dom and Jean house.<br/>
Worth mentioning was the presence of both Kaslan Lutim and Dan Lutim. To pre-empt any accidents, it is the custom of Forest’s Edge for either the head or the heir to stay behind and guard the house. Last night, the conference participants stayed in the Wu clan village to keep guard over Zuro Tsun’s family. On the other hand, Dan Lutim and Rau Lei went back home.<br/>
An exception had been made for Dan Lutim to take on this escort duty. The one who gave the order was Donda Wu. Donda Wu probably made the decision to bring this strongest party as they would be venturing to the unknown territory of the city.<br/>
Ai Fa and Mida were here too, so seven out of the Eight Braves of the Wu clan’s test of might tournament were here.<br/>
The only absentee was Jiza Wu, who stayed behind in the village. The safety of the hundred odd kins of the Wu clan had been entrusted to Jiza Wu, the heir of the Wu clan. Shin Wu who wasn’t selected for the escort team also stayed behind to perform his own duties.<br/>
As we headed to the Post Station Town down the small green path with hunters all around us, I thought:<br/>
Speaking of which… the hunters from the north sure are intimidating.<br/>
They were the former kins of the Tsun clan, the elites of the Zaza, Dom and Jean house from the north. They were as mighty as the kins of the Wu clan, and everyone of them had an intimidating aura.<br/>
As we walk down the road towards the Post Station Town, Graff Zaza said to everyone: "Do anyone have any issues with Dick Dom and Dan Lutim taking charge of the escorts duties?"<br/>
Dick Dom was the head of the Dom house. He was a buffed man wearing the skull of a kiba on his head. Dick was bigger than Donda Wu and Graff Zaza, and taller when he stood erect. His face and arms were covered in scars. Of all the Forest’s Edge denizens, he was the most ferocious looking.<br/>
"With me and Big Dick Dom here, we can take on a hundred men!"<br/>
Dick Dom looked quietly at Donda Wu who was laughing heartily. However, a pair of dark eyes were burning with rage under his kiba skull.<br/>
Their characters were extreme polar opposites, but I couldn’t imagine a stronger duo. I realized once again that the Forest’s Edge was betting everything they had on this.<br/>
"Well met, everyone from Forest’s Edge."<br/>
When we reached the boundary between the Forest’s Edge and the town, Leito was already waiting for us.<br/>
Barcia was a witness invited by Kamyua Yost. So Leito would head into the city with us.<br/>
"Malfreed already prepared an entry pass for Barcia, but he couldn’t mobilize the city guards for personal reasons. Will it be fine to head to Pyschkurewuss directly?"<br/>
"Yes. In the end Kamyua Yost, didn’t return in time, huh."<br/>
"There is still some time before noon. I hope he can make it in time."<br/>
In any case, we couldn’t turn away Leito now. So we headed together for the city.<br/>
In the past, Donda Wu and the others would walk in the woods and avoid being seen by the Post Station Townsfolk, but that wasn’t possible with this large entourage.<br/>
"There’s no need to hide. When you got kidnapped by the noble’s daughter, we had even more denizens running around."<br/>
"I see… But Zuro Tsun and the others are here too, right?"<br/>
Diga and Doddo wasn’t tied up, but Zuro Tsun was still restrained with topes. If we walk along the Post Station Town so bolsterously with Zuro Tsun in tow— would we cause confusion and chaos in town, just like that time with Zattsu Tsun?<br/>
We had Mida with us too. Mida used to destroy stalls that sell food he dislike. He had slimmed down a little, but the Post Station Townsfolk would definitely recognize him.<br/>
"There’s no need to hide. Don’t make me repeat myself…"<br/>
After saying that, Donda Wu turned back to the group and said: "Let Zuro Tsun and the others stay in the middle. Asuta of the Fa house, stay with the women."<br/>
"Alright, understood."<br/>
I realized that this was a necessary cautionary measure.<br/>
Would the Tsun clan that performed all sorts of misdeed be forgiven by the people of Genos? Kaslan Lutim once said, that the landlord of Genos wasn’t the only one who would decide that. For these criminals, this was an inevitable trail.<br/>
I looked over, and Zuro Tsun seemed exhausted from the journey through the forest trail, and was wheezing like a toad. Diga and Doddo hung their heads low troublingly.<br/>
Diga had always feared the townsfolk, while Doddo was as weak as Diga if he didn’t drink. But compared to how they were before dinner last night, their eyes looked more human now.<br/>
In contrast, the women had faces of determination. Yamiel Lei and Zwei aside, Aura who always looked frail lift her head calmly as if she was facing her fate.<br/>
"Let’s go."<br/>
Including Leito, our group of 27 passed through the alley between buildings and stepped onto the stone paved road.<br/>
It was almost noon, so the town was starting to get crowded.<br/>
And of course, fear and confusion started to spread around us. Zuro Tsun and the others were not prominent under the encirclement of the hunters. However, the figure of the northern hunters wearing kiba skulls and heads had a big impact.<br/>
The Zaza and Dom villages were very far from the Post Station Town. Even with their wagons, they probably only send their women to visit the town. Hence, it had been many decades since the northern hunters last showed up in the Post Station Town.<br/>
Even though Mida was in the center of the group, he still stood half a head taller than the others. Zattsu Tsun and the others committed their crimes outside of the Post Station Town, and the ones who terrorizing the townsfolk were just Doddo and Mida. The monstrous looking Mida had left a terrifying scar in their hearts.<br/>
Some of the younger women and elderlies wailed, while others dropped on their knees from fright. Even the southerners who were less discriminatory than the westerners turned stiff at the sight of Mida.<br/>
The hunters of Forest’s Edge walked proudly under these gazes of fear and confusion. Even the towns guard on patrol didn’t dare to come near.<br/>
Ahh, isn’t that…<br/>
A short distance away, I saw a familiar face.<br/>
It was the innkeeper of the 《Kimyusu’s Tail Inn》, Milano Mast. He stood in front of his inn and cast a stern gaze towards us.<br/>
The criminals were all dead, and the living were innocent— Even though Milano Mast said that, Zuro Tsun and the others were still the criminal’s kin. I couldn’t imagine what was going through Milano Mast’s head right now.<br/>
We continued further and got near the marketplace where Yang was about to open his stall. The ladies working with him all stood still with green faces, and Yang also looked at us in shock.<br/>
As a chef from the city, Yang wasn’t fond of Pyschkurewuss. He wasn’t involved in the feud between the Forest’s Edge and Pyschkurewuss, but he probably heard what had transpired from Polarse.<br/>
Yang still sought me out from the group and nodded at me firmly. I acknowledged him though Ai Fa and Ludo Wu’s shoulders with a nod.<br/>
And then, when we could finally see the edge of the Post Station Town— a figure suddenly appeared before us.<br/>
It was the vegetable stall owner Uncle Dora.<br/>
Donda Wu who was leading the group wave his right arm to signal everyone to stop.<br/>
"T-Tribal chief of the Forest’s Edge, Donda Wu? Do you remember me? When Asuta was abducted, I met you a few times."<br/>
Uncle Dora looked pale, and his buffed body looked as weak as a puppy before our group.<br/>
Ai Fa and I looked at each other and then rushed towards him. In the meantime, Donda Wu and him continued to converse:<br/>
"I don’t recall learning your name. You must be the vegetable stall owner from the Post Station Town."<br/>
"Y-Yes. I’m selling vegetables harvested from the Taliem farms. My name is Dora. Your children often visit my stall."<br/>
Donda Wu who stood tall like a Nio[1] said in a hoarse voice: "So— The aria and poitan we ate are sold by you?"<br/>
The pedestrian watched with bated breath at the two of them speaking.<br/>
"T-That’s right. Asuta and the members of the Wu clan often patronize my stall, and I’m very grateful for that. Donda Wu, I… I hope to continue doing business with all of you."<br/>
At this point, Ai Fa and I finally reached Donda Wu’s side.<br/>
Uncle Dora smiled meekly as he shivered.<br/>
Donda Wu said: "We want to continue living as we always do— even if change is inevitable, we will hope it will be a change for the better."<br/>
"That’s our goal today. If the conference goes smoothly, my daughters will gladly visit your stall again."<br/>
"I sincerely hope so too. May the western god Selva watch over you. Asuta and everyone, do your best…"<br/>
"Yes, thank you."<br/>
Uncle Dora backed away, and Donda Wu continued onwards as if nothing happened.<br/>
Tara rushed to the side of Uncle Dora as he watched us go. I looked back at them until they were completely out of sight.<br/>
Whether we can continue living with the people in the Post Station Town— will be decided by today’s conference.<br/>
And so, we went through the Post Station Town, and the sides of the roads became sparse vegetation once again. We continued north, and a road leading to the west appeared. At the end of this road was the city. The rock walls hidden by the trees could now be seen in plain sight.<br/>
The 6 to 7 meters tall rock wall surrounded the city. This was the first time I had seen it while it was still bright out.<br/>
The wall extended to the west seemingly without end. After walking 20 meters, we finally saw the gate. It was a giant arc shaped gate. Merchants wearing lavish clothes and elderly men escorted by guards walked along the suspended bridge leading into the gate.<br/>
And then— When we reached the bridge, a group of men came out of the southern woods.<br/>
"Tribal chiefs, we have been waiting for you."<br/>
One of them walked to Graff Zaza.<br/>
The tall young men wore a hide cape with the head still attached, and was as large as Graff Zaza— He was the eldest son of the Jean house. Behind him were 30 hunters of the Forest’s Edge, a mixed unit of the Zaza, Jean and Sauti houses.<br/>
The towns guard at the gate didn’t make any strange moves— confirming the safe return of the tribal chiefs was part of these hunters’ duty. We were still worried about Pyschkurewuss attacking the Forest’s Edge settlement while we were away.<br/>
"In the city, the bell will ring six times starting from noon till dusk. If the conference still has not ended by the third bell, I will despatch a messenger to you. Before that, you men are to standby here."<br/>
"Understood."<br/>
The hunters disappeared into the woods once again.<br/>
A guard used this chance to approach us from the other end of the bridge:<br/>
"Tribal Chiefs of the Forest’s Edge, welcome."<br/>
This tall soldier had the crest of the Count Tulan house— He was Jimon. He treated Ludo Wu and me very cockily, but his attitude towards the Forest’s Edge Tribal Chiefs was different.<br/>
"I’m the captain of the Count Turan House First Guards, Jimon. Allow me to lead you to the Count Turan manor. There are eight participants, seven criminals and ten escorts, correct?"<br/>
"The numbers are right, but I have to correct you on one thing. Only one of these seven is a criminal. Isn’t the purpose of this interrogation to determine if the rest are guilty of any crimes?"<br/>
Jimon lowered his head expressionlessly: "My apologies for having misspoke…"<br/>
It was hard to tell what he was going through his mind in the presence of so many hunters.<br/>
"Also, there are two other attendees. They are not part of our group."<br/>
When he heard what Donda Wu said, Leito and Barcia walked forth:<br/>
"We are here to attend the conference on the invitation of the Castle guard captain Malfreed. We have our entry pass ready, so please lead the way."<br/>
"… The Count has already notified me about this."<br/>
Jimon said as he issued instructions towards the suspension bridge with his right hand.<br/>
"We have prepared the entry pass for the tribal chiefs, please board the Totos carriage."<br/>
"Totos carriage?"<br/>
A few carriages came our way quietly. There were four large carriages drawn by two totos each. They were box carriages, with the crest of the Count Turan House on their sides.<br/>
"You even prepared carriages, thank you for your hard work. Did you mistook us for some noble princesses?"<br/>
"I won’t dare. However, it is quite some distance to traverse from the gates to the manor on foot, also— this will avoid causing unnecessary alarm to others."<br/>
Jimon explained eagerly, and Donda Wu grunted impatiently.<br/>
"A carriage can seat ten, please board whichever one you like."<br/>
"Hmmp…"<br/>
Naturally, the armed hunters and those who weren’t armed were divided evenly between the carriages.<br/>
The ones seated with me were Ai Fa, Ludo Wu, Darum Wu, Barcia and Leito. We sat three to a row in the spacious carriage. Ai Fa and Ludo Wu sat on either of my side.<br/>
I asked the driver: "Erm, can we draw the curtains on the window?"<br/>
"Please do as you wish…"<br/>
His voice trembled a little, and he didn’t manage to conceal his emotions like Jimon did.<br/>
In any case, I didn’t hold back and opened the curtain on the window.<br/>
"It feels unsettling to not see our surroundings."<br/>
Barcia who sat opposite me also pulled the curtains. She had a scimitar on her waist, and was one of our armed guards.<br/>
"Set off!"<br/>
On Jimon’s orders, the Totos carriages started crossing the bridge one after another.<br/>
We slowly moved away from the woods where our tribemates were hiding.<br/>
Finally…<br/>
It was finally time for the decisive battle.<br/>
Would the complicated relationship between the Forest’s Edge and Genos improve today? No one could tell.<br/>
However, Kamyua Yost planned to use Barcia as the witness to reveal Pyschkurewuss’ crimes, and the tribal chiefs were determined to settle things today.<br/>
Was Pyschkurewuss— Or rather, the landlord of Genos, Marstein, a worthy enough Forest’s Edge Lord for the denizens to serve? They will figure that out in today’s conference.<br/>
With all sorts of thoughts in our mind, we finally stepped into the Genos City.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
2<br/>
So, this is Genos City huh…<br/>
I saw the scenery of the city clearly for the first time while riding the rickety carriage.<br/>
The streets and buildings were made from rock, befitting the name of Rock city.<br/>
The streets were wide, buildings tall, and trees could be seen occasionally. There were barely any mud patches on the ground, and the pedestrians all wore extravagant clothings.<br/>
But foreign merchants like Shumimaru and Dell could enter the city. There were many southern merchants on Totos pulling heavy cargoes, and easterners who wore their hoods low too.<br/>
All the yellowish brown and ivory skinned westerners had lavish attire, and most of them looked like merchants. The area near the gates was probably where the merchants gather.<br/>
Further ahead, there was a plaza with a fountain, and I could see stalls set up here.<br/>
It seems that the citizens have to work and earn a living too.<br/>
Given how big the city was, there must be tens of thousands of residents. The nobles were just a small minority.<br/>
There were men selling piles of vegetables.<br/>
Women promoting beautiful woven products to passersby.<br/>
Children running around the fountain as they ate red colored fruits.<br/>
Everyone look so lively, enjoying this peaceful world.<br/>
The denizens of Forest’s Edge don’t want to threaten the safety of these people either.<br/>
Or rather, the harsh life of hunting kiba was for the sake of protecting these citizens’ prosperous lives.<br/>
In Genos, only the Turan and Taliem houses own large fields. The people in the citizenry probably bought their food from outside the Rock wall.<br/>
Fuwano, fruit wine, all sorts of vegetables and high quality products could be bought in the city at a high price. Someone told me that Post Station Town only sells sour and cheap Tarapa, while the expensive Tarapa were bought by the people in the city.<br/>
That isn’t a bad thing. However… don’t the people in the Rock wall know that they owe their prosperity to the denizens of Forest’s Edge?<br/>
And of course, the denizens of Forest’s Edge didn’t work hard as hunters for the gratitude of the people in the city. Ai Fa who was looking out the window beside me didn’t seem too affected by what she saw.<br/>
However, there was still something I didn’t quite understand.<br/>
Leaving Pyschkurewuss aside, what did the landlord of Genos, Marstein actually thinks? Does he think nothing of the other places, as long as it is peaceful and prosperous in the city?<br/>
The Totos carriage moved along the street briskly, paying no heed to what was going through my mind— and soon, we arrived at that manor.<br/>
"We are here…"<br/>
The moment the driver made that announcement, someone opened the rear door.<br/>
We alighted onto stone paved ground, and a building made from stone loomed before us.<br/>
This was the Count Turan House manor I was confined too six days ago. It was the first time I looked at it in daylight. It was a large building constructed with stones and greyish bricks. Only the roof was yellow. By the way, I remember Kamyua calling the Count Turan manor as the yellow house in the past.<br/>
It was squarish, with structures expanding to the sides like wings. The middle building was four storey tall, while the side buildings had three levels. By the way, I was confined by Lifuria in the building on the right.<br/>
Before reaching here, we saw all sorts of building in the city, but this was by far the most extravagant. To me, this felt like a rather large school.<br/>
Stone walls 4 to 5 meters tall surrounded Pyschkurewuss’ manor. We were standing inside the courtyard within the stone walls, which was big enough to hold four carriages and 30 odd men.<br/>
There was a straight stone paved path leading right into the middle of the building, with green lawns on either side of the path. At night, guard dogs would be set loose on this grounds.<br/>
But… Only two people are living in this grandiose building. This isn’t built to house the numerous servants and guards.<br/>
At this moment, Jimon said: "This way please" and started walking towards the building.<br/>
The Tribal Chiefs led the way, and I followed behind.<br/>
Two guards stood sentry at the main door, hilding silver spears in their hands. Jimon approached them, and one of the guards opened the heavy door.<br/>
"Please come in."<br/>
Jimon continued, but Donda Wu didn’t budge.<br/>
"Wait, only the participants will enter."<br/>
"… What do you mean? We have prepared a waiting room for the escorts."<br/>
Dan Lutim who was right behind Donda Wu answered Jimon:<br/>
"But we will have to turn in our blades for safekeeping if we enter this door, correct? What good are escorts that aren’t armed!? So we won’t go in."<br/>
"However… I don’t think you can perform your duties if you don’t accompany the Tribal Chiefs."<br/>
"Don’t worry! We will protect the Tribal Chiefs and this building!"<br/>
Dan Lutim laughed heartily after saying that.<br/>
Jimon nodded and replied softly: "I see."<br/>
"In that case, we will assign a few guards to stay with you, please follow the instructions of the guard leader. Will that be fine?"<br/>
"Yes, of course!"<br/>
"We will leave this to you then. Tribal Chiefs… this way please."<br/>
We entered the manor under the watchful gaze of the smiling Dan Lutim, serious Ludo Wu and the ferocious gazes of Darum Wu and Dick Dom.<br/>
Beyond the door was a wide hall with yellowish brown carpet.<br/>
After entering, the doors closed heavily behind us.<br/>
"Welcome…"<br/>
There were ten or so servants dressed in yellow waiting for us. They had yellowish brown or ivory skin, and were boys younger than me. They stood in a line with their head bowed, and didn’t show any expression as if they were wearing masks.<br/>
"We will safekeep your blades…"<br/>
A few of them reached out their hands politely.<br/>
Donda Wu and the others surrendered their blades from their waist wordlessly.<br/>
"… Would you like to deposit your cape…?"<br/>
"No need. This is the honor of a hunter."<br/>
Donda Wu sounded calm as usual, but the youth who spoke just now shirked away fearfully.<br/>
After glancing at that youth, Donda Wu turned back to his companions and said: "Take out all the daggers and needles in your hunter’s cape. You won’t have any complains if we don’t bring any weapons with us, correct?"<br/>
On his orders, the hunters emptied their capes of all these weapons.<br/>
And so, everyone was disarmed. We already expected that, but it was still unnerving when it happened.<br/>
"This way please."<br/>
We followed behind Jimon along the carpeted corridor.<br/>
We took a left at the end of the corridor, and the passageway became narrow like a maze. We were now in the left branch of the building. I had never been here before, but the cramp and dim sensation felt really familiar.<br/>
There were a few doors in our path, but we ignored them and continued down the meandering path. The complicated route was probably a defensive measure against infiltrators.<br/>
We were slowly getting farther away from Dan Lutim and the others outside the manor. However, I already told Donda Wu about the structure of the Pyschkurewuss’ manor, and he already made preparations outside the building. There was no need to worry— but my heart was still racing.<br/>
And finally, we climbed up a spiral staircase, then walked to the other end of the passageway before Jimon stopped. Before us was a door guarded by two spearmen.  Jimon shouted at the door: "The guests from Forest’s Edge are here!"<br/>
A hoarse voice answered him, and Jimon opened the door. He went in quickly, and we followed right behind him.<br/>
And so, I met Pyschkurewuss again.<br/>
"Tribal Chiefs of the Forest’s Edge, well met… My apologies for the inconvenience I caused because of my health."<br/>
The hoarse voice of Pyschkurewuss echoed out.<br/>
This was a large square hall more than ten meters wide on each side.<br/>
The floor was covered with reddish brown carpet, with large screens covering the walls on the side. At the far end of the room was a large drape that appeared to be made from silk. Pyschkurewuss was seated under that giant drape that had a large emblem of the Count Turan House on it.<br/>
Dali Sauti swept his gaze across the hall, and answered crudely: "I heard you aren’t feeling well, but I’m glad to see that you have enough strength to talk."<br/>
I also took a peek around the place.<br/>
It was an annoyingly extravagant room. The screens and rugs looked lavished, and stools that matched our numbers had been laid out. The room would feel less empty if there was a large table in the center, but right now, it felt strangely barren.<br/>
Pyschkurewuss and someone I had never seen before sat right before us. A few meters to the side, Malfreed and an unfamiliar silver haired elderly man sat opposite us.<br/>
"This person here is the Captain of the Towns Guard, Shileru. Beside Lord Malfreed is the Chief Justice of Genos, Lord Xylas."<br/>
The person opposite us drew my attention; so that was Pyschkurewuss’ brother. He was a stout middle aged man in simple white armor. His flat nose was very prominent, his face was fat and he had a funny looking, mushroom-like short brown hair.<br/>
He should be in his forties, and wasn’t frail like the old Pyschkurewuss. His only feature that resembled Pyschkurewuss was his gripping eyes.<br/>
On the other hand, Xylas was a skinny old man dressed in a white robe, with golden accessories glittering on his chest. From my position, I could only see the side of his face, and he looked irritated.<br/>
"By the request of Lord Malfreed, Shileru and Lord Xylas are also participating in this conference. Tribal Chiefs, do you have any objections…?"<br/>
Donda Wu nodded without a word. Leito already explained this to us ahead of time.<br/>
By making Shileru, who was Pyschkurewuss’ accomplice, and the Chief Justice who was the master of Genos law attend this meeting, Kamyua Yost plans to reveal Pyschkurewuss’ wrongdoing.<br/>
However, Kamyua Yost was absent from the conference. Despite his absence, Malfreed was still here with us. I peeked at Malfreed worriedly.<br/>
I already heard from Kaslan Lutim, but this was the first time I saw him without his helmet. He had light brown hair, a thin nose and a tight jaw. His features were more delicate than I imagines, and had an air of nobility about him. His tall toned body was covered in a simple white armor, giving off the image of a sharp warrior.<br/>
However, his grey eyes were still as cold as a reptile. It was icy in a different way from Yamiel Lei.<br/>
"Tribal Chiefs of the Forest’s Edge, please be seated…"<br/>
Dali Sauti raised an eyebrow at Pyschkurewuss’ urging.<br/>
"Thank you for your reminder, but the denizens of Forest’s Edge do not have the custom of sitting on chairs."<br/>
"I have heard that before. However… today’s conference might take a long time, may I request you all to follow the custom in Genos for just this once? It feels unsettling for me to be the only one sitting."<br/>
Dali Sauti wanted to argue some more, but he seemed to remember something, and followed Pyschkurewuss’ advice. So we decided to sit down too.<br/>
It was a simple wooden stool without any backing, As Pyschkurewuss and his brother were seated in wide chairs with armrests and a big backing that befits a noble, it felt like they were looking down at us from a high vantage point.<br/>
And because of our large numbers, our seats were divided into the left, center and right group, as if we were surrounding Pyschkurewuss from a distance.<br/>
Leito, Barcia, Ai Fa and I were seated on the right, beside Malfreed. The Tribal Chiefs entourage sat on the left, while Zuro Tsun’s group of seven took the bottom seats.[2]<br/>
"Please call for me if you require my presence."<br/>
Seeing that we were seated, Jimon left the hall.<br/>
At this moment, I finally realized the reason for the dissonance I felt.<br/>
Pyschkurewuss didn’t have any guards beside him.<br/>
I heard that he would attend meetings with 20 guards, but this time, even Jimon left the room. Only Pyschkurewuss’ plump brother was with him.<br/>
Ai Fa sensed my suspicion and whispered: "Asuta, don’t let your guard down… their soldiers are hiding behind that large drape."<br/>
"There are twenty… No, maybe more. No matter how much they try to conceal themselves, they couldn’t be completely silent."<br/>
"I see. They plan to hide themselves and throw us off our guard."<br/>
"If that is true, then they are laughably shallow. But it seems that even Malfreed can’t bring in a blade."<br/>
That surprised me, so I peeked at Malfreed who was beside Barcia. It was true, Malfreed’s trademark dual swords weren’t by his waist.<br/>
"During the last meeting, Kamyua Yost and him were permitted to bring in their blades… Maybe the rules in Count Turan’s manor is different from the city. In any case, don’t let your guard down."<br/>
There were probably tens of armed soldiers hiding behind Pyschkurewuss. In contrast, we have seven Forest’s Edge hunters— including Mida, that would be eight. Barcia and Malfreed were formidable too, but none of us were armed. I couldn’t help worrying about what might happen if a clash happened.<br/>
At this moment— Dali Sauti suddenly cried out.<br/>
And a strange smell whiffed over.<br/>
Shileru shouted with a slurred voice: "What’s this weird smell!?"<br/>
"Pardon me, I accidentally crushed a kiba repelling fruit when I was sitting down."<br/>
"K-Kiba repelling fruit!?"<br/>
"It’s a rarely seen fruit used by the Sauti clan. The pungent smell can repel kiba for half a day, and is a very precious fruit. Such a waste."<br/>
It was an unpleasant stinging smell.<br/>
"Don’t worry, it’s harmless. But we should open the windows to ventilate the hall."<br/>
Pyschkurewuss showed a cringey smile and showed his hospitality: "… It’s still early, so all the windows are open. Please don’t mind and take a seat, Tribal Chief of the Forest’s Edge."<br/>
Dali Sauti raised his butt with a "Yes", then sat his ass down again.<br/>
The windows should be on behind the screens to my right. There were light shining from the small windows at the top of the wall, and the ventilation wasn’t bad either.<br/>
However, the Kiba repelling fruit was very pungent, and made me choke.<br/>
"A month ago, when we were guiding a caravan, we also used these Kiba repelling fruits. However, someone used a large amount of Kiba attracting fruit that rendered the repellent ineffective. That was why that horrible incident happened again."<br/>
Pyschkurewuss said with a smile still on his face: "… There’s no need to rush, the bell for noon hasn’t rang yet. Let us have a good chat and clear any misunderstandings…"<br/>
His face was still a sickly green, but he didn’t seem too ill. His small body leaning on the armrest seemed to be quivering a little, and he looked a little weak.<br/>
"However… That blondie who said all those slanderous things to Malfreed isn’t here, huh?"<br/>
Pyschkurewuss looked at Malfreed with his cringey smile.<br/>
"He slandered Shileru and me, and then failed to show up… this is both infurirating and a let down. What are your thoughts on this, Lord Malfreed?"<br/>
"I don’t see any issues here. Kamyua Yost told me in advance that he might not make it back in time, and his representative is here in his place."<br/>
Leito was all smiles, while Barcia stared at them unwaveringly.<br/>
I heard Barcia mumbled: "I see…".<br/>
"I see… So that’s how it is."<br/>
Ai Fa and I who were seated near her were probably the only ones who heard her. Barcia showed a brave smile and glared at Pyschkurewuss’ brother, but not Pyschkurewuss himself.<br/>
Pyschkurewuss’ brother shouted in a slurred voice: "What nonsense! How dare that wanderer who happened to be acquainted with Marquis Genos slander me and my brother!"<br/>
"As the Captain of the Towns Guards, I have many duties to fulfill! Our workload is different from the Castle guards keeping peace in the city! Lord Malfreed, don’t you think so…?"<br/>
Malfreed didn’t answer, and just glared back at Shileru with his cold grey eyes.<br/>
Shileru stomped his feet while seated like a child.<br/>
"Hmmp, forget it. This is the end of that wanderer’s scheme! As the eldest son of the Marquis Genos house, your sins are heavy for believing the wild ramblings of that despicable man, Lord Malfreed."<br/>
"Shileru, enough of your angry talks… The truth will be unveiled today."<br/>
After Pyschkurewuss said that, the dull clang of the bell came from afar.<br/>
The sun was at its peak.<br/>
A creepy smile appeared on Pyschkurewuss’ darkish green face, and he announced: "Well then, let’s start the conference…"<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
3<br/>
"Let me start off by relaying the message from Marquis Marstein Genos. The Marquis mentioned that two issues need to be resolved with today’s conference."<br/>
Pyschkurewuss lifted his index finger and said: "First."<br/>
"For the Tsun clan members who committed the grave sins of desecrating the grace of the forest, the laws of Genos need to be clear on how heavy their punishment should be…"<br/>
Zuro Tsun’s group of seven listened to Pyschkurewuss without blinking their eyes.<br/>
Zuro Tsun hung his head low, while Diga and Doddo seemed troubled for the first time since their arrival in the manor. Yamiel Lei and Aura showed no emotions, Zwei had a sour face— and Mida had a dumb expression as usual.<br/>
Pyschkurewuss raised his middle finger: "Number two."<br/>
"Determine the true identity and goal of Asuta of the Fa house, the foreigner who claims to be part of the Forest’s Edge… The Marquis made it clear that this two points must be resolved."<br/>
Dali Sauti said unhappily: "Hmmp, so to Marquis Genos, our doubts on whether Count Turan is really innocent doesn’t matter, huh."<br/>
Pyschkurewuss bared his teeth in a smile and said:<br/>
"Don’t worry, Tribal Chief of the Forest’s Edge. I’m certain that everything is closely related. By the time the conference ends, we will come to a consensus of the facts and mutual understanding."<br/>
"When that moment comes, we will give gracious thanks to the Mother Forest and the western god."<br/>
Dali Sauti shrugged his massive shoulders. Pyschkurewuss slowly averted his gaze, swept by Zuro Tsun, and fixed onto me.<br/>
"Well then, let’s start with the questioning of Asuta of the Fa house…"<br/>
I straightened my back and looked right at Pyschkurewuss.<br/>
"Asuta of the Fa house, a few days ago, my daughter did something terrible to you… But ironically, this allowed us to know your true identity. You are not a citizen of Amusehorn, created by the four Great Gods, but a Migrant. Is that true?"<br/>
"Yes. I had never called myself a Migrant before, but it is true that I’m not from this continent."<br/>
"Hmm… Indeed, Migrants won’t call themselves that. Well then… Can we follow your custom and refer to you as Citizen of the Dragon Deity?"<br/>
"Citizen… of the Dragon Deity?"<br/>
"Migrants worship the Dragon Deity that rules over the sea… Therefore, the Migrants call themselves Citizen of the Dragon Deity, correct?"<br/>
This was the first time I heard that. I could only tell the truth. I grew more tense as I adjusted my posture on the uncomfortable chair.<br/>
"I was born on an island nation that wasn’t part of this continent, but I don’t worship the Dragon Deity, or think of myself as a Citizen of the Dragon Deity. In that sense, I’m not a Migrant."<br/>
"You aren’t a… Migrant?"<br/>
Pyschkurewuss’ eyes seemed to be burning in silence.<br/>
Shileru beside him roared: "Bollocks!"<br/>
"Everyone who came from beyond the ocean are Migrants, and Citizen of the Dragon Deity! Brat, don’t mock us with your foolish ramblings!"<br/>
"No, I’m not trying to fool you."<br/>
"Hmmp! I heard that the Migrants and Mahildra are the same race! Legends say that in ancient times, Mahildra people who abandoned the continent became Citizen of the Dragon Deity! That’s why Migrants don’t trade with Mahildra! Since the blood of Mahildra flows in your veins, then you are our sworn enemy!"<br/>
I didn’t give an immediate answer.<br/>
But I had to prove my innocence.<br/>
However, before I could formulate a rebuttal, Pyschkurewuss restrained his fuming brother.<br/>
"… From what I have heard, the Migrants resembles people from Mahildra. Tall barbarians with blonde hair, purple eyes and reddish skin…"<br/>
Pyschkurewuss then looked at my body.<br/>
"However, you have black hair and eyes, and your skin tone is similar to westerners… Which means… You really aren’t a Citizen of the Dragon Deity…?"<br/>
"That’s right. I was born in an island nation named Japan, and we don’t call ourselves Citizen of the Dragon Deity."<br/>
"Japan… Where exactly is that island nation…?"<br/>
"I’m not sure either. I was brought into the middle of the continent against my own will."<br/>
I answered as I observed Pyschkurewuss’ face. His gaze was a little strange as he leaned forth enthusiastically. He looked as innocent as a toddler that found a new toy, which was incredibly creepy.<br/>
"You are talking nonsense again! Genos is in the middle of the continent, and far from any oceans! No matter who you are, anyone who wanders where from overseas is suspicious! You even claim that you didn’t come here by your own will— Brat, are you hiding some nefarious scheme!"<br/>
Shileru was yelling as usual. Seeing him remind me of Diga and Doddo before the Tsun clan’s demise. Those who couldn’t suppress their emotions and possess authority had an inflated ego. The air about him was like a two bit villain, but something about him felt more more dangerous than Diga and Doddo.<br/>
"I’m not planning anything nefarious. When I came to, I was already collapsed in the Morga Forest— and was saved by Ai Fa of the Fa house. I realized that I couldn’t return home, and decided to settle down in Forest’s Edge."<br/>
I took care not to anger Shileru, and answered with a firm tone.<br/>
"What crimes am I guilty of? I might be born overseas, but I still wish to become a member of the Forest’s Edge. Since the Forest’s Edge denizens are citizens of the western god Selva, then I want to become a citizen of Selva too."<br/>
"… Abandoning one’s faith and becoming a citizen of Selva…?"<br/>
"That’s right. I had the resolve to do so when I came here."<br/>
Pyschkurewuss leaned back on his chair, and looked at the elderly Xylas.<br/>
"Lord Xylas, what do you think… Can a Migrant become a citizen of Selva…?"<br/>
The elderly man answered with his voice void of any emotions: "Hmm. There are no precedence, so I would like to seek the advice of the Bishop and the Church."<br/>
Unlike Malfreed, Xylas seemed to be intentionally concealing his emotions. He was probably nervous about dealing with the denizens of the Forest’s Edge.<br/>
"Well then, we will have to consult with the Bishop first… Asuta of the Fa house, you are a prime suspect."<br/>
"Prime suspect?"<br/>
"Yes… the suspicion of working with that outlaw Kamyua Yost to drive a rift between Genos and the Forest’s Edge."<br/>
Ai Fa said quietly: "Nonsense."<br/>
A blue flame burned in her eyes.<br/>
"Count Turan. I have been living with Asuta for these few months. I know very well that Asuta doesn’t have such maleficious thoughts. What you said is an insult towards me."<br/>
"Is that so…? No matter how long you have lived together, you can’t completely know what someone is really thinking…"<br/>
Raging flames erupted from Ai Fa’s eyes, and she said quietly: "Asuta isn’t just someone, he is my family."<br/>
"Asuta won’t betray me. Only someone who understands that can take Asuta in as family. Please retract your words…"<br/>
"Allow me to share my thoughts."<br/>
Kaslan Lutim spoke calmly:<br/>
"When Asuta approach us with regards to setting up business in the Post Station Town, the head of the Wu clan Donda Wu expressed his doubts too. Hence, he set a condition Donda Wu. If Asuta and Kamyua Yost has any nefarious schemes, he will cut off his right arm. Asuta’s right arm is still there, which means he has earned Donda Wu’s trust."<br/>
"Oh… Trust huh…"<br/>
"There are many in the Forest’s Edge that opposes Asuta’s business. But no one suspect Asuta of conspiring with the people in the city. I think your statement is not just a slight against Asuta and Ai Fa, but slander towards all Forest’s Edge denizens."<br/>
"I see… Regrettably, we don’t have enough proof to believe Asuta, young hunter of the Forest’s Edge."<br/>
Pyschkurewuss said slowly:<br/>
"Asuta of the Fa house, I heard you first visited the Post Station Town on the 14th of the Green Month… Is that so?"<br/>
"Hmm? I don’t really remember. It should be around two months ago."<br/>
"It is recorded in the police station of the Post Station Town. That day, you had a scuffle with the second son of the Tsun clan, and was rescued by Kamyua Yost, right?"<br/>
Doddo’s shoulders quivered from fear.<br/>
"Less than half a month later, you started a business in the Post Station Town, and brought wealth to the Fa house and Wu clan… Another half month later, the Tsun clan’s crimes were uncovered, and they fell from grace as the Tribal Chief clan… Is all that a coincidence?"<br/>
"Are you saying that this is not a coincidence… but intentional? Kamyua Yost did advise me to start a business in the Post Station Town, but that’s it. As you know, he came up with a plan together with Malfreed to uncover the Tsun clan’s crimes, and advised me to start my business to avoid souring the relationship between the Forest’s Edge and the Post Station Town. I only knew that after the fact."<br/>
"Hmm… But aren’t you and the Wu clan members the first ones to uncover the Tsun clan’s crimes? Kamyua Yost’s plan only bore fruit after that."<br/>
Pyschkurewuss had a creepy smile on his face.<br/>
That was the ‘Munto-like smile’ that Kaslan Lutim mentioned before.<br/>
"Kamyua Yost and you manipulated Lord Malfreed and the Forest’s Edge denizens respectively, leading to the demise of the Tsun clan… Isn’t that why you are pretending to be a member of the Forest’s Edge…?"<br/>
"What do you mean by pretending!"<br/>
Ai Fa’s eyes started burning with rage, and Shileru hollered: "Why is that woman so fierce!?"<br/>
But Pyschkurewuss was smiling as usual.<br/>
"This is the only explanation that will work… After Asuta of the Fa house and Kamyua Yost appeared in the Post Station Town, the Tsun clan fell in a month. And the two of you are closely related to their demise. It’s too unnatural to think of this as a coincidence…"<br/>
"The Tsun clan fell from grace because of the unrest they brought to Genos and Forest’s Edge. What good will that bring us anyway?"<br/>
"You are a migrant, and Kamyua Yost is a Mahildra half breed… Do you need any reason to bring disaster to the western kingdom?"<br/>
Pyschkurewuss’ voice was so viscious that it seemed physical.<br/>
"And… On top of that, my Turan county employ many laborers from Mahildra. It is only natural for Mahildra people to bear a grudge…"<br/>
"But like I said, I’m not a Citizen of the Dragon Deity, and isn’t related to Mahildra. I don’t have any reason to bring harm to the western kingdom."<br/>
"Migrants are basically Citizen of the Dragon Deity. You might not look like them, but we can’t be certain just from that."<br/>
I never expect Migrants to be closely related to Mahildra.<br/>
However, even when I state that I wasn’t from this continent, the people of Genos didn’t display any hostility towards me. Migrants being people from Mahildra was probably just a theory that Pyschkurewuss was trying to push for.<br/>
But I wasn’t sure how to respond. Furthermore, Kamyua Yost and I were on the same side, making it even harder to clear my name.<br/>
"I heard that you are rather skilled as a chef… That’s why your business in the Post Station Town is a success, and brought great wealth to the Fa house and Wu clan. You gained their trust from this… Isn’t that right, Asuta of the Fa house…?"<br/>
"That isn’t so. I’m doing my business for the sake of bringing more wealth to the Forest’s Edge settlement. I know that it is foolish for a foreigner like me to think this way, but Ai Fa and Kaslan Lutim’s encouragement gave me the resolve."<br/>
These were my true feelings.<br/>
However, I didn’t think Pyschkurewuss listened at all.<br/>
That was only natural, to them, the truth didn’t really matter. They just want to acknowledge things that are advantageous to them.<br/>
There wasn’t any meaning to present one’s true feelings to people without any sincerity— But I couldn’t suppress the emptiness I was feeling inside.<br/>
As I was formulating what to say, someone spoke:<br/>
"Lord Pyschkurewuss… what’s the reason in discussing all this?"<br/>
It was Malfreed.<br/>
"Even if Asuta of the Fa house and Kamyua Yost are compatriots, their goals have nothing to do with us. It won’t change the fact that the Tsun clan committed a grave crime, or remove the suspicion on you and Sir Shileru."<br/>
"…There is a good reason."<br/>
Pyschkurewuss restrained Shileru who was about to yell, and continued: "The Tsun clan did commit a serious crime… But the only ones who can prove that are Zattsu Tsun, Tay Tsun, and your fake caravan group… The other matter is their assault of that caravan ten years ago, so that’s the only two issues, correct?"<br/>
"Hold it. Aside from that, there’s also the issue of the Tsun clan desecrating the forest. That’s the reason why Zuro Tsun is apprehended and awaiting sentencing."<br/>
Dali Sauti said in a shrill voice.<br/>
Pyschkurewuss turned and look at him with a sinister smile.<br/>
"We didn’t witness the crimes of the Tsun clan… We can only believe what you say."<br/>
Dali Sauti said agitatedly: "Are you saying that we are pinning falsified crimes on the Tsun clan?"<br/>
Those who were usually calm would also get agitated before the people from the city. As Dali Sauti and Kaslan Lutim were the more rational ones of the group, the two of them handled the negotiations with Pyschkurewuss together.<br/>
"Not everything you say is a lie… But even the noble Forest’s Edge denizen might get deceived by the people in the city."<br/>
"So, the ones who deceived the Tsun clan is—"<br/>
Pyschkurewuss cut off Dali Sauti:<br/>
"Tribal chiefs of Forest’s Edge, have you not been deceived by Asuta of the Fa house and Kamyua Yost? The Tsun clan might have damaged the Morga Forest… But who uncovered their crimes? On the day of the House Head Conference, didn’t you mentioned that Asuta was the one who revealed their wrongdoings?"<br/>
"That is correct. Because Asuta was tending to the hearth, so he realized the truth before anyone else did. There is nothing strange about that."<br/>
"Then you should be grateful to Asuta of the Fa house. After all, the Tsun clan had been violating the rules of the Forest for more than a decade…"<br/>
"What do you want us to say to thank him?"<br/>
Dali Sauti was gradually losing his calm.<br/>
Pyschkurewuss smiled, as if he was soothing Dali Sauti.<br/>
"Isn’t this the scheme of Asuta of the Fa house… Kamyua Yost and Asuta of the Fa house gained the trust of Lord Malfreed and the Forest’s Edge denizens by revealing the Tsun clan’s crimes. And now, they are pinning crimes onto the Tsun clan and me in order to bring chaos to Genos."<br/>
"I see. So you are saying that the Tsun clan’s only crimes are desecrating the Morga Forest and attacking the caravan, and everything else are just conjectures by Kamyua Yost."<br/>
Kaslan Lutim answered calmly.<br/>
"Attacking the Banam envoy, the murder of the Town guards Captain— and framing the ‘Red Beard Gang’ for these crimes are just slanders by Kamyua Yost. Is that your argument, Pyschkurewuss?"<br/>
"That is so, young hunter of the Forest’s Edge. Kamyua Yost attempt to gain our trusts with half truths, what a devious scheme…"<br/>
Pyschkurewuss crossed his arms over his thin stomach, and said pretentiously:<br/>
"That man claims to be a half blood from Mahildra… so he could have lived peacefully in Semu or Jagaur that didn’t bear any hostility towards Mahildra. However, he went out of his way to spend half his life in Selva, and held a grudge towards this country… I couldn’t help feeling pity towards the denizens of Forest’s Edge and Lord Malfreed who got dragged into his evil schemes."<br/>
"… Why are you insisting that we are morons who can’t tell right from wrong, Pyschkurewuss?"<br/>
Graff Zaza couldn’t take it anymore and said in a coarse voice:<br/>
"We never thought of that foreigner Kamyua Yost as a comrade. However, we felt that some of his words can be trusted, that’s why we are holding this conference to determine the truth, Pyschkurewuss."<br/>
"So…? You only trust Kamyua Yost, and suspect me of lying, is that really the right way…?"<br/>
Pyschkurewuss said as he turned to look at Zuro Tsun.<br/>
"Zuro Tsun… the former Tribal Chief of Forest’s Edge…"<br/>
Zuro Tsun looked up at Pyschkurewuss with hollow eyes.<br/>
"It has been more than twenty years since I was tasked as the liasion with the Tribal Chief of the Forest’s Edge. I worked with Zattsu Tsun for the first decade, and build up a relationship with you for the next decade… And I have seen the truth with my own eyes."<br/>
"……"<br/>
"Zattsu Tsun is filled with wild ambitions. I have always been worried about him turning his ambition towards Genos… But I have never felt that from you."<br/>
"……"<br/>
"You might have led the Tsun clan down the wrong path… However, you are merely treading down the road paved by Zattsu Tsun. In that case, it is too pitiful to condemn you alone as a criminal…"<br/>
Graff Zaza interjected anxiously: "What do you mean by pitiful. We have already discussed this in Forest’s Edge. The sins of neglecting to hunt kiba and desecrating the Morga Forest for over ten years is too grave. Also… many had died from despair in the Tsun clan village."<br/>
"So… the denizens of Forest’s Edge decided that Zuro Tsun will be responsible for all these crimes…?"<br/>
"Zuro Tsun is the tribal chief and the head of the Tsun clan. Zattsu Tsun is no longer the clan head, so Zuro Tsun will have to take responsibility for the crimes for the past decade."<br/>
Graff Zaza’s eyes were burning with rage.<br/>
The one closest to Zuro Tsun would be his former kin Graff Zaza.<br/>
The Tsun clan and Zaza house had been linked through many marriages throughout the years. I had no idea just how complicated the relationship Graff Zaza shared with the Tsun clan.<br/>
However, Pyschkurewuss didn’t know anything about all that, and mocked:<br/>
"Yes… Like what you said, no matter how pitiful Zuro Tsun might be, we still need to give him a sound judgement. However… if you had been deceived by outsiders, then the situation will be different…"<br/>
"… Are you insinuating that Asuta of the Fa house and Kamyua Yost are deceiving us?"<br/>
"Yes… If you don’t agree with me, you can ask the Chief Justice of Genos, Xylas to comment on this from a fair and neutral perspective…"<br/>
With that, Pyschkurewuss looked towards the old man.<br/>
Xylas who was seated beside Malfreed frowned a little confusedly:<br/>
"Sir Xylas… Should Zuro Tsun who had led the his people down the wrong path be punished for his crimes?"<br/>
"Yes… As the tribal chief and clan head, it is a heavy crime to forcefully coerced others to break the law."<br/>
"Then, should his family be punished for this crime too…? The family of Zuro Tsun over there had been stripped of their family name and forced to join the other houses as punishment…"<br/>
"That is not in accordance with the laws of Genos."<br/>
Xylas answered emotionlessly:<br/>
"From what I know, the house heads are the ones ruling the families in Forest’s Edge. In that case, the family members has no choice but to follow the head’s orders. Since the branch house members are innocent, those six are not guilty either."<br/>
"I am not saying that the branch house members are innocent. We feel that this is a road of redemption for them to live properly again as a denizen of Forest’s Edge."<br/>
Kaslan Lutim interjected calmly:<br/>
"This also applies to the six members of the Tsun clan main house. They had more or less suffered the unhealthy influence of Zattsu Tsun. We feel that they need to discard their Tsun family name in order to break off this bond holding them back."<br/>
"Hmm… So, you have stripped the Tsun clan of their rights to be the tribal chief clan?"<br/>
A strange light glimmered in Pyschkurewuss’ eyes, and he said with a smile: "I don’t agree with you on that… Considering the fact that there was interference from outsiders, I’m against it even more."<br/>
"Asuta wasn’t involved in their sentencing. Asuta’s action was crucial to uncovering the Tsun clan’s crimes, but the decision was made by all the house heads that had gathered for the House Head Conference."<br/>
"However, if this was all part of the scheme to pull the Tsun clan off their position of tribal chief, that changes everything. And you people had even been conned by Kamyua Yost and slandering me. We can’t believe the tribal chiefs elected under such a dubious situation… I have reservations on accepting you."<br/>
Silence engulfed the entire room.<br/>
I caught a glimpse of how Pyschkurewuss would try to let the Tsun clan off their crimes.<br/>
There were points we expected, and arguments we didn’t thought of. How should we counter his words— As the tribal chiefs fell into deep thought as they fumed, someone spoke:<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
"Well then… If you don’t trust the current three tribal chiefs, then what is your goal? Are you trying to reinstall the Tsun clan back as the tribal chief clan?"<br/>
With a cold laugh— Yamiel Lei’s voice broke the silence.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
4<br/>
"… I didn’t have the chance to learn your name…"<br/>
Pyschkurewuss slowly shift his gaze to Yamiel Lei.<br/>
Yamiel Lei answered with a flirty smile:<br/>
"I was formerly the eldest daughter of the Tsun clan, Yamiel Lei. Besides me are Diga, Doddo and Mida. These two are Aura and Zwei. Aura was Zuro Tsun’s former spouse, and the rest of us are his children. However… Aura’s only child is Zwei, the other children are borne by different mothers."<br/>
"Yes… You do have the audacity befitting a successor of Zattsu Tsun’s bloodline."<br/>
"Should I feel honored and offer my sincere gratitude in response?"<br/>
Yamiel Lei’s tone was combative, and it made us all break out in cold sweat.<br/>
"I have been meaning to ask, did you summon us here because you think the Tsun clan’s punishment is too light? We came here with the resolve to accept the punishment as dictated by the Genos law."<br/>
Yamiel Lei swept her gaze across her former family as she said that.<br/>
The one who reacted to her gaze was Mida.<br/>
"Yes… Mida did many wrong, so Mida properly… a-tone…? Wu clan people tell me I need to atone…"<br/>
It wasn’t clear how much Mida understood about the conversation earlier, and he stuttered badly like a child. But his words were filled with sincerity.<br/>
"Mida wants to live in the Wu clan as a Forest’s Edge denizen… No matter what punishment there is, Mida won’t cry…"<br/>
The hall feel silent once more.<br/>
Shileru muttered: "Freak", which could be heard in the entire hall.<br/>
For a moment, I felt my veins were going to burst from anger, but someone grabbed my arm to stop me from losing myself. I turned back, and saw Ai Fa who was as furious as me leaned towards my ears and whisper:<br/>
"Don’t be rash. Our tribes mate feels the same way as you do."<br/>
I quickly steadied my breathing, then apologized with a nod.<br/>
Yamiel Lei sneering voice echoed in the hall once again:<br/>
"As you can see, even Mida who is the most childish among us has made his resolve. However, for some reason, you are discussing that the punishment decided by the tribal chiefs are inadequate?"<br/>
"… In the previous meeting, we didn’t know about Kamyua Yost and Asuta’s schemes. It doesn’t change the fact that we need to re-examine the seriousness of your crimes."<br/>
"I see… but no matter what you plan to do, it is impossible for the Tsun clan to become the tribal chief clan again, Count Turan."<br/>
"Is that so… but why…?"<br/>
"Isn’t it obvious? Right now, no one in the Forest’s Edge settlement wishes for the Tsun clan who had betrayed their tribe mates to be reinstalled as the tribal chief clan."<br/>
Yamiel Lei said coldly:<br/>
"The Forest’s Edge can’t forgive depravity and betrayal. If the Tsun clan becomes the tribal chief clan again, everyone in the Forest’s Edge will probably revolt. Maybe they would abandon the Morga Forest. Lord Count… is that what you wish for?"<br/>
"But… the Forest’s Edge tribe also respects the law, right? Since you have judged that except for Zuro Tsun, all the other Tsun clan members are innocent, then another clansman can…"<br/>
"No, the Tsun clan had neglected to hunt for more than a decade. The branch house members just started learning to hunt from the other houses. And as you can see, this is the current state of the main house."<br/>
Yamiel Lei pointed at Diga and company with her soft finger.<br/>
"The Forest’s Edge denizens will never accept a clan that can’t hunt kiba to be tribal chief. No matter what, the Tsun clan has lost the rights to be the tribal chief clan."<br/>
Depending on the situation, I will take on the role of tribal chief just like what Pyschkurewuss wants— Yamiel Lei who said that and was stopped by Grandma Jiba and Graff Zaza was now refuting Pyschkurewuss.<br/>
Pyschkurewuss fell into deep thought at this unexpected attack. His brother said impatiently:<br/>
"Woman, you might think you make a lot of sense, but that is just the ramblings of a barbarian! Your nonsense holds no water in the eyes of the law!"<br/>
Yamiel Lei looked towards Shileru coldly.<br/>
Shileru laughed hysterically, and his mushroom-like hair shook along with him:<br/>
"The rights isn’t decided by one’s ability! It depends on one’s bloodline and status! No matter how incompetent or devious one might be, the most important is his bloodline!"<br/>
"… So you are saying, it doesn’t matter how incompetent or evil the heir is, it will be fine if he isn’t a criminal?"<br/>
"That’s right! No one in the world understand this better than me and my brother!"<br/>
Pyschkurewuss made a blank facial expression and closed his eyes.<br/>
For some reason— the air felt strange.<br/>
"Lord Malfreed, Lord Xylas, you must know what I mean. Our father and older brother were incompetent and foolish! They weren’t bad to the bones, but they were mere mortals unworthy of inheriting the Count Turan House! Before my father and elder brother were summoned to meet Selva, we were living in their shadows!"<br/>
Elder brother— so the current house head Pyschkurewuss has an older brother?<br/>
Anyway, a strange emotion was burning in the eyes of the flushed face Shileru.<br/>
"But before Selva opened a path for us, we can only endure! And worry about the future of house Turan! Denizens of Forest’s Edge, if you want to live in Genos, then you have to follow the rules of Genos! Even if your tribal chief is incompetent, even if he is a retard, you have to support him and follow him. That is your only choice!"<br/>
"I don’t know what you have been through… But does the law of Genos dictates that the Tsun clan must be reinstated as the tribal chief clan?"<br/>
Yamiel Lei stared right at the rambling Shileru and answered:<br/>
"The Tsun clan was elected to the position of tribal chief by our tribemates decades ago. And now, all the house head unanimously elect the Wu clan, Sauti clan and Zaza house as our tribal chiefs. I think this has nothing to do with the law of Genos."<br/>
"Since this was decided by the denizens of Forest’s Edge, then we can’t interfere… But it will be a different matter if people who attempts to disrupt the order in Genos are elected."<br/>
Pyschkurewuss has revived.<br/>
His strange face and silence were gone, and he looked back at Yamiel Lei with a cringey smile.<br/>
"I think it is too dangerous to accept the three house heads that got elected because of the schemes of Kamyua Yost and the Migrant Asuta… I’m worried about these three clans bringing more harm to the Forest’s Edge and Genos than the Tsun clan…"<br/>
"So you want the eldest son of the Tsun clan to be the new tribal chief?"<br/>
Donda Wu spoke for the first time.<br/>
Compared to the furious Graff Zaza and Dali Sauti, he looked very calm.<br/>
"If bloodline is so important to you, then Diga would be the most qualified."<br/>
Diga looked back at Donda Wu with surprise, his frail face filled with fear.<br/>
"Diga Tsun, so you are the eldest son…"<br/>
Pyschkurewuss’ cringey eyes locked onto Diga.<br/>
"Your father will be put on trial as the former tribal chief and clan head… As his heir, aren’t you responsible for leading your tribe down the right path?"<br/>
"I… I…"<br/>
Diga stuttered.<br/>
Like a frog caught by a snake.<br/>
"You are still young… I think that you will be the most suitable person to right the wrong of your father and grandfather… What do you think…?"<br/>
Diga gulped.<br/>
And— for some reason, he glanced at Ai Fa and me before saying:<br/>
"I,I… I was stripped of the Tsun family name a month ago. I… don’t have the right to inherit the position of tribal chief."<br/>
"I see… But, if stripping of your family name is a mistake, then you—"<br/>
"I-I didn’t overcome my fear of the villain Zattsu Tsun, and fled from the Dom village! And I also escaped from Zattsu Tsun! I don’t have the right to call myself a Tsun!"<br/>
Diga suddenly shouted.<br/>
Tears flowed out of his sunken eyes.<br/>
"Tay Tsun also fled with us out of the Dom village! But he stayed with Zattsu Tsun to take back the Tsun name… And died a criminal! Doddo and me who abandoned Tay Tsun don’t have the right to call ourselves a Tsun! How could we!? If you still insist on giving the Tsun name back to me, then scalp me together with my father!"<br/>
"…If Diga is executed, then I will be the next in line as the second son."<br/>
Doddo mumbled with a gloomy voice:<br/>
"But I feel the same as Diga. So… Next in line will be Mida."<br/>
Mida looked down at his brothers with eyes wide open.<br/>
Yamiel Lei glanced their way before showing a flirty smile:<br/>
"Mida is just 14, and can only inherit the role of clan head next year. Before that, I will take on the role as the eldest daughter… And of course, I don’t want anything to do with the malicious role of Tsun clan head."<br/>
"… When there aren’t any heirs above 15, according to tradition, the spouse of the head can become the clan head."<br/>
Aura held Zwei’s hand tightly and replied calmly:<br/>
"I don’t want to become the clan head either. Please execute me with Diga and the others."<br/>
Everyone turned down the position of Tsun clan head.<br/>
Yamiel Lei raised the corner of her lips as she looked at the silent Pyschkurewuss:<br/>
"It seems we have run out of candidates from the main house. If there are no heirs from the main house, the branch house that are closer may become the clan head. However… Zuro Tsun’s brothers died without leaving any descendents, so a branch house member that isn’t as closely related has to take on the role."<br/>
"……"<br/>
"But even if someone does take on the role of clan head, they won’t be able to handle being the Tribal Chief. The branch house members living under the tyranny of Zattsu Tsun has already lost the guts to inherit this post."<br/>
Yamiel Lei paused and gazed towards Graff Zaza with a strange look in her eye:<br/>
"If a branch house member becomes the clan head, then they would want to become the subordinate house of their former kin house. In order to revitalize our fallen bloodline, seeking refuge with the most powerful Zaza house will be the best choice. So in the end, Graff Zaza will still inherit the role of Tribal Chief."<br/>
"……"<br/>
"If you place so much emphasis on the Tsun clan’s bloodline, then this is the only choice. Are you satisfied now, Count Turan?"<br/>
"Don’t be ridiculous! Aside from Mida and me, everyone is executed, I can’t accept that!"<br/>
Zwei suddenly stood up.<br/>
"Don’t leave your seat!"<br/>
Shileru shouted, and Zwei responded with an: "Annoying."<br/>
"I have been sitting here listening quietly, but every one of you are so stubborn! We don’t need to be manipulated by you nobles in the first place!"<br/>
"You! Are you looking down on the Genos aristocrats!?"<br/>
Shileru unconsciously reached for the weapon on his waist, but of course, there wasn’t anything there.<br/>
Zwei snort and glared at him:<br/>
"If you call yourself Masters of the Forest’s Edge, then take responsibility! Zattsu Tsun made a mockery of the law, but aren’t you the same? Why are you acting so conceited towards us?"<br/>
"You—!"<br/>
"The denizens of the Forest’s Edge decided to atone for Zattsu Tsun’s crimes together! For the Tsun clan, living on righteously is our way to atone, and for the others, guiding the Tsun clan down the correct path is how they will atone! So the Wu clan, Lutim house and Dom house accepted us into their family!"<br/>
The smallest sized Zwei stood up, and glared at Shileru as if she was protecting her mother. Her sanpaku eyes had an even more intense flame than yesterday.<br/>
"When Zattsu Tsun committed crimes outside the Forest’s Edge, you gave your silent consentment by not interfering, so you are accomplices too! What rights do you have to blame the denizens of Forest’s Edge?"<br/>
"That’s just the wild ramblings of that outlaw Kamyua Yost! And we have no idea of the Tsun clan’s crimes!"<br/>
"Are your eyes just decorations!? The Wu clan and Lutim house who uncovered these crimes first are more competent!"<br/>
Zwei then continued with her eyes half closed:<br/>
"Also— Diga and Doddo already said this before, right? The people from the city is afraid of bringing the Tsun clan members to task. When Doddo and Mida caused trouble in the Post Station Town, didn’t you settle them under the table?"<br/>
"That’s true. When we brought this up during the last meeting, it was brushed off too. Can you give us a satisfying answer this time?"<br/>
Kaslan Lutim reached his long arm out to pull Zwei back to her seat, then interjected calmly:<br/>
"You mentioned that you didn’t know about the crimes of Zattsu Tsun and the others. But you have been unjustly condoning the wrongdoings of Doddo and Mida. Why is that so?"<br/>
"……"<br/>
"I’m asking you, Captain of the Towns Guard, Shileru. The ones covering up for Doddo and Mida are the guards in town, and you are their Captain, correct?"<br/>
"Hmmp! How can I be responsible for the negligence of the guards in the Post Station Town!? My job is to lead the entire Towns Guard!"<br/>
"So managing the guards isn’t your responsibility?"<br/>
Kaslan Lutim pressed calmly, and Shileru responded with an ugly sneer:<br/>
"If you have a problem with, then I can give you the head of the Lead Sergeant. I’m not responsible for that!"<br/>
"So the Lead Sergeant did so on his own digression? I heard that guards rushed down from the city to pay for Mida’s damage to the stall and settle the dispute."<br/>
"How would I know!? Show me proof that someone from the Towns Guard did all that!"<br/>
"… Regrettably, I don’t think anyone will scrutinize your every move."<br/>
Kaslan Lutim remained calm throughout all this:<br/>
"Asuta is actually a born and bred denizen of the Forest’s Edge. Will you believe me if I say that…?"<br/>
"What? What bollocks is that?"<br/>
"In the Forest’s Edge settlement, people with Asuta’s features would be born from time to time. Asuta claiming to be a Migrant is just a joke, so please retract your suspicion of him colluding with Kamyua Yost."<br/>
"What nonsense! Who do you think you are fooling by saying all that—"<br/>
"Then, do you have proof that Asuta is a Migrant? Asuta just happen to look this way, and ventured into the Post Station Town for the first time when he was 17. How then, could he collude with someone from town to bring disaster to the Forest’s Edge and Genos?"<br/>
Kaslan Lutim said all that with a serious face, then smiled.<br/>
"That’s how you sound like. If you won’t believe us, we won’t believe you either."<br/>
Shileru kept his mouth shut with a furious face.<br/>
At this moment, Leito pressed on with a smile:<br/>
"Well then, it’s almost time for us to make our move. Showing the evidence will be helpful to everyone."<br/>
"… Child, you must be the serf of that Kamyua Yost."<br/>
Pyschkurewuss looked at Leito with sly eyes.<br/>
"I heard you are the son of the caravan leader that was attacked ten years ago. I feel sorry for your loss, but a child like you isn’t any good as a witness…"<br/>
"Yes, I have no value as a witness. I’m just attending on Kamyua Yost’s behalf. The witness invited by Kamyua Yost to visit Genos is Barcia over here."<br/>
Pyschkurewuss narrowed his eyes in surprise.<br/>
Leito smiled even more gleefully when he saw that expression:<br/>
"As Kamyua couldn’t make it to this conference, so you think he is pushing me to be a witness? You are mistaken. The person Kamyua was searching for outside Genos, is Barcia."<br/>
Barcia glared at Shileru without a word.<br/>
Leito glanced at her, then continued:<br/>
"Barcia is the wife of the late Goram of the ‘Red Beard Gang’. Do you understand her value as a witness now?"<br/>
"Wife… Woman? She is… a woman…?"<br/>
"How rude. But I’m used to being mistaken for a man."<br/>
Barcia smiled fearlessly. She pulled off the string tying up her hair. Her unexpectedly long dark brown hair fell beside her face.<br/>
"How’s this? Do I look like a lady now? Although the phrase feminine doesn’t suit me at all."<br/>
Everyone probably realized something was different.<br/>
The flushed face Shileru turned stiff like a statue, and the color was fading from his face.<br/>
"For the past decade, I retrained my rusted body. I was slim back then, so you didn’t recognize me, right? As for you… I know who you are at first sight."<br/>
"W-Who are…"<br/>
"Stop pretending to be retarded. Aren’t you the one who asked my husband to attack the Banam envoy, Shileru?"<br/>
An intense fire was lit in Barcia’s eyes.<br/>
"If you are still doubting me, why don’t you pull back your ugle bangs? The wound inflicted by the furious Goram on your forehead should still be there, correct?"<br/>
Shileru pressed his back onto his chair, and started shaking. He probably didn’t even realize that he was covering his forehead with his hand.<br/>
"I didn’t think a noble would subjugate the bandits himself. It seems that Kamyua was right."<br/>
Leito was smiling as usual:<br/>
"Before your appointment as Captain of the Towns Guard, you must be really idle. Kamyua also said that you won’t entrust such unlawful deeds to anyone who isn’t your kin, Lord Pyschkurewuss."<br/>
"I see… So it’s the scheme of that foolish man…"<br/>
Pyschkurewuss smiled gloomily.<br/>
"He thought up this scheme after learning about the old wound on Shileru’s head… That woman over there, if you don’t want to die, then stop your nefarious actions…"<br/>
"Hmmp, you don’t have to worry about that. If I don’t have the resolve to put my life on the line, do you think I will dare challenge you nobles?"<br/>
"Oh… So you do understand…? The wife of Red Beard Goram was a member of a bandit gang before she gave birth, you know…?"<br/>
"I know that very well."<br/>
"Hmm… So you have the resolve to be execute as a survivor of that bandit gang…?"<br/>
Pyschkurewuss shot a viscious gaze towards her.<br/>
"We can’t forgive your crimes even after ten years… Since you claim to be the wife of Red Beard Goram, then before accusing Shileru of his crimes, you will have to be executed as a criminal…"<br/>
"You sure is long winded. Didn’t I say I’m willing to put my life on the line?"<br/>
Barcia glared at Pyschkurewuss with a bold grin.<br/>
"I’m the last member of the ‘Red Beard Gang’, the wife of Red Beard Goram, Barcia. I’m prepared to face all consequences. I wouldn’t have come without this resolve."<br/>
I held my breath.<br/>
And recalled Barcia from this morning.<br/>
She mentioned wanting to see her son Geta— so that was the determination Barcia had when she said that.<br/>
Ai Fa beside me was also staring at Barcia.<br/>
"I swear on my life to the western god Selva, that I’m Red Beard Goram’s wife, and that man over there is the despicable villain who coerced Goram to commit banditry. He told my husband about Banam despatching envoys, the time of departure, the route they will take and details on their security and escorts. He then coerced my husband to massacre the envoy and seize their goods."<br/>
"S-Shut up! A man with the Count Turan House bloodline won’t seek out bandits like you—"<br/>
"Isn’t a count in Genos just an honorary position? Kamyua Yost said that aside from the head and the heir, the others won’t be appointed to crucial roles or given large amount of wealth."<br/>
In contrast to the panicking Shileru, Barcia was high spirit:<br/>
"So you are only running an errand on your house head’s orders? Never mind, I don’t care. The only thing I can do is give my testimony that you are the one who coerced my husband. I will leave the rest to others."<br/>
The hall turned silent once more.<br/>
The one who broke this silence was Malfreed:<br/>
"Lord Shileru, you were appointed as the Captain of the Towns Guard right after the Banam envoy was attacked. I heard that Lord Pyschkurewuss gave his strong recommendation, contrary to the rules."<br/>
"……"<br/>
"And after your appointment, you determined that the ones who murdered your predecessor and the Banam envoy was the ‘Red Beard Gang’, and send out a subjugation team. However… the reason why the ‘Red Beard Gang’ was suspected, was because they were the only bandit gang that was powerful enough to pull this off."<br/>
"……"<br/>
"However, the Morga Forest attack that was pinned on the ‘Red Beard Gang’, was actually committed by Zattsu Tsun’s group. Don’t you think this was because his plan to take in the ‘Red Beard Gang’ as his subordinates fell through, so he framed them to seal their lips?"<br/>
"Bollocks! The ‘Red Beard Gang’ are vicious bandits! There is no doubt that they committed serious crimes for many years!"<br/>
"That’s true. They might have the principle of not killing people, they are still criminals. They can only pay for their crimes for banditry with their lives."<br/>
Which means— Barcia’s fate was sealed.<br/>
Ai Fa gritted her teeth as I turned anxious.<br/>
"That is exactly why, before the sword of justice is brought down on her, we have to make everything clear. Even if they are criminals, we can’t pin crimes on them unjustly."<br/>
"Please wait, Lord Malfreed… This is the scheme of that outlaw Kamyua Yost. That despicable man set many traps in order to frame Shileru and me."<br/>
Pyschkurewuss held back Shileru whose face was turning red and green. His eyes were like a cornered beast, but he still had a twisted smile.<br/>
"That woman might be a survivor of that bandit gang… but she might not be stating the truth…"<br/>
"You mean she is lying? Why would she risk her life to lie?"<br/>
"She probably has personal reasons… For example, if Kamyua Yost has a hostage more important to her than her own life…"<br/>
Barcia said with disdain: "Hmmp! Are you talking about my son Geta? Kamyua Yost might be a formidable guardian, but it’s not easy to catch that silly son of mine."<br/>
Pyschkurewuss looked at Malfreed with a twisted smile:<br/>
"That might not be so… Half a month ago, a small red haired bandit attacked Asuta and some Forest’s Edge denizens. If that little bandit is the son of that bandit gang, then he must have made contact with Kamyua Yost and Asuta. Is that really a coincidence…?"<br/>
"It was a coincidence, Geta and I went our seperate ways a year ago. I acted on my own accord, and that child did what he wanted, we both live our lives apart."<br/>
Pyschkurewuss continued ignoring Barcia.<br/>
"And, there are new suspicion on Kamyua Yost… Lord Malfreed, have you heard about bandits disguised as Forest’s Edge denizens attacking the Taliem farms…? I suspect that is a scheme by Kamyua Yost and others."<br/>
Malfreed listened expressionlessly. He revealed no emotions in his grey eyes.<br/>
"He left Genos with several Forest’s Edge hunters… And shortly after that, bandits attacked the farms… So you are saying Kamyua Yost tricked the hunters accompanying him into committing banditry, in order for the Towns Guard to apprehend them?"<br/>
"That’s right… And of course, Shileru didn’t fall for a scheme that is full of holes. And right now, a subjugation team is patrolling the outskirts of Genos in order to arrest the criminals that are disturbing the peace on Kamyua Yost’s orders. It won’t be long before the Towns Guard bring them in."<br/>
So all that commotion was for the sake of framing Kamyua Yost, and not the Forest’s Edge denizens, huh.<br/>
Pyschkurewuss’ top priority must be sealing Kamyua Yost’s lips.<br/>
In that case, it will be better if Kamyua Yost didn’t make it back in time. But… it’s hard for the conference to progress if Kamyua is absent.<br/>
At this moment, I heard a voice from behind:<br/>
"Lord Count, a guest is here!"<br/>
The voice of Jimon came from behind the thick doors.<br/>
Pyschkurewuss’ scary smile slowly turn stiff:<br/>
"Guest…? All the participants should be here already…?"<br/>
Leito said cheerfully: "That’s not true, I’m just a stand in after all."<br/>
Everyone realized who that person was.<br/>
"Sorry for being late, I’m glad that I made it here before everyone went home."<br/>
A loud, lazy voice echoed through the hall.<br/>
Kamyua Yost who I had not seen for half a month sauntered into the hall.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
5<br/>
Shileru yelled: "Impossible!"<br/>
"Why are you here… What are my men doing!?"<br/>
"The townsguards completed their mission dutifully. I was really startled by that large unit situated all around town."<br/>
Kamyua Yost looked at Donda Wu with a cocky smile.<br/>
"Donda Wu, the three men from the Wu clan has returned safely. They don’t have entry passes, so they linked up with the hunters standing by at the city gates."<br/>
Donda Wu nodded quietly.<br/>
The ignored Shileru stomped his feet again:<br/>
"You are still suspected of coercing bandits to attack the farms! Could it be— you killed the Towns Guards?"<br/>
"No no, I merely persuade them sincerely, and they grant me passage. You might suspect me of this crime, but there aren’t any official warrants for my arrest."<br/>
Kamyua Yost was the same as usual.<br/>
The long journey dirtied his clothes, but his lazy attitude and carefree smile was the same as usual. Kamyua Yost reached his long arms to the door that was still open.<br/>
"I also brought a guest. Malfreed, the entry pass I requested from you didn’t go to waste."<br/>
At this moment, a young man in elegant dressing appeared.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
He had black hair that was rare among westerners, and his skin was ivory skin that seemed untouched by the elements. The boyishness was still on his serious face, and he was neither fat nor slim. Like Kamyua Yost, he wore a long cloak, and only his extravagant pants and leather boots were visible.<br/>
Sharp gazes fell on him, and no one seemed to recognize this young man.<br/>
"This is Sir Wellhyde from the Marquis Banam house. The second son of the current Marquis’ sister, and sixth in the line of succession."<br/>
Shileru yelled in a shrill voice: "F-From the Marquis Banam house?"<br/>
That youth had steely nerves as he looked at Shileru with pursed lips.<br/>
"The envoy that was attacked ten years ago was led by Sir Wellhyde’s father. I think Sir Wellhyde has the right to know the truth, so I invited him to accompany me."<br/>
Pyschkurewuss stared at Kamyua Yost who responded casually as he muttered:<br/>
"Jimon……"<br/>
"Are they the only guests…? Then close the doors."<br/>
"Yes, my liege—"<br/>
Jimon hesitated for a moment, but he didn’t defy his master’s orders and closed the heavy doors.<br/>
"My apologies for being late and bringing an unexpected guest. No need to bother with a chair. Leito, would you kindly give up your seat to Sir Wellhyde?"<br/>
Leito stood up, and the youth named Wellhyde sat down silently.<br/>
"Kamyua Yost… What are you trying to do…?"<br/>
"Your question is right on point, I have been meaning to invite Sir Wellhyde to this conference. I think we need a witness who can remain calm. And so… I think Sir Wellhyde who is related to this incident is a suitable candidate, and managed to convince him yesterday."<br/>
"……"<br/>
"I requested Lord Malfreed to prepare a letter of recommendation, since I was just a wanderer. It took me a lot of time to get an audience with the Marquis house. And during this time… I heard there were bandits disguised as Forest’s Edge denizens causing trouble, but between the 6th to the 13th of the White Month, we had the alibi of being in Banam. And there is no chance the innkeeper will not recognize my Mahildra dressing and my Forest’s Edge companions."<br/>
When I was confined in Pyschkurewuss’ manor, the bandits kept harassing the farms until the 9th. Did Kamyua Yost stayed in Banam to give himself an alibi?<br/>
"I seemed to be suspected of coercing banditry, but you can’t produce any proof of that. I explained that I was escorting Sir Wellhyde, a noble of Banam, to Genos and the Towns Guard grant me passage."<br/>
"Are you… Trying to drag the Marquis Banam house into your schemes?"<br/>
"The one who dragged them in wasn’t me. It was the people who attacked the envoy ten years ago. If that tragedy didn’t happen, Sir Wellhyde wouldn’t be visiting Genos."<br/>
Wellhyde who was sitting beside the shrugging Kamyua Yost spoke for the first time: "I—"<br/>
"I’m here for the truth. I heard that I can find out the truth behind my father’s death if I come here. I will visit Marquis Marstein Genos to apologize on another day for my unannounced visit."<br/>
The son of the envoy that was attacked, which means that this young man had the same experience as Milano Mast. It’s true that he wasn’t here on Kamyua Yost’s invitation, but to seek the criminal behind that incident ten years ago.<br/>
"Well then, everyone is here. Barcia… I’m grateful that you came."<br/>
"Yes, I felt lost up until last night, but I have made my resolve."<br/>
Barcia’s fierce gaze met Kamyua Yost’s unfathomable eyes.<br/>
Barcia who was here as a witness would also be executed as a felon— Kamyua Yost definitely knew this from the start. Kamyua Yost looked at Barcia with his clear eyes, then turned towards Pyschkurewuss:<br/>
"The interrogation seemed to have ended. Eldest son of the Marquis Genos house, Lord Malfreed, Sir Wellhyde of the Marquis Banam house, and that gentleman over there must be the Chief Justice of Genos. You have yet to confess your crimes before these men?"<br/>
"Kamyua Yost… Why are you trying to bring disaster to Genos…?"<br/>
"Bring disaster to Genos? No, what I wish for is the prosperity of Genos and a just trial."<br/>
Kamyua Yost spread his arm with a smile. His cloak was lifted up, making him look like a large bird spreading one wing. Kamyua Yost used his left hand to clutch at his heart.<br/>
"I’m a believer of the western god Selva. I already disavowed the northern god Mahildra 15 years ago. What I wish for… is peace in the Selva territory of Genos."<br/>
"Arrogant… if you are not sincere towards the gods, your soul will be decimated…"<br/>
"Yes, why would I bring disaster to Selva at the expense of my very soul? The western kingdom didn’t treat me very well, but Mahildra was even harsher towards me."<br/>
Kamyua kept his ‘wing’ with a cocky smile:<br/>
"If that isn’t true, why would I change my faith? I was born in Mahildra, but my mother was persecuted by others. After I lost my mother, I didn’t hesitate in switching my religion. If I was vengeful enough to sell my soul, I would wish to bring disaster to Mahildra, and not Selva."<br/>
"……"<br/>
"Fortunately, Genos is far away from Mahildra, so someone like me won’t be persecuted. That’s why I can safely wish for Genos’ prosperity. Or rather… aren’t you the one who cursed the world, Lord Pyschkurewuss?"<br/>
"……"<br/>
"You are only concerned about growing your own wealth. Instead of the prosperity of Genos, or growing the influence of the Turan house, but your own power. That is how this tragedy started."<br/>
Kamyua Yost chuckled with a clear light in his eyes. This strange gaze reminded me of Grandma Jiba.`<br/>
"Lord Pyschkurewuss, you are the second son of the main house, correct? In Genos, being from the Count house isn’t that prestigous. Sir Polarse from the Count Taliem house told me that the second son will have to live their entire life in the shadows."<br/>
"……"<br/>
"Sir Polarse didn’t have the ambition of gaining wealth and fortune by eliminating his father and brother, but what about you? As the second son of the Count Turan house that was given just a thin strip of land, what plans did you have?"<br/>
"… You want to slander me even more…?"<br/>
"This isn’t slander, I’m impeaching you."<br/>
Kamyua Yost aimed straight for the heart of the matter:<br/>
"All these matters with the Forest’s Edge denizens and the ‘Red Beard Gang’ ten years ago— coercing the Forest’s Edge tribal chief Zattsu Tsun to attack the caravan leaving for Semu, the Banam envoy and the Captain of the Towns Guard. I only caught wind of these three matters, but you definitely committed numerous other crimes. I even suspected you of murdering the former head and heir of the Count Turan House, your own father and brother."<br/>
"What—"<br/>
"You can’t stand living in the shadows, so you murdered your father and brother, correct? I can’t produce any proof, but your brother died after falling off a Totos and snapping his neck. And less then a year later, your father succumb to illness. I suspect his death was due to you feeding him Semu poison herbs."<br/>
"How… dare you accuse the head of the Count Turan House without proof…?"<br/>
Pyschkurewuss’ gaze clinged to the tall Kamyua Yost like an amoeba.<br/>
But Kamyua Yost’s eyes remained clear with an easy smile on his face.<br/>
"You want to accuse me of disrespecting a noble? If you are innocent, then please go ahead. I will do something more disrespectful later. What I just said was all in the past. But that’s not the full extent of your ambition, correct?"<br/>
"You—"<br/>
"I tried pushing my imagination to the limit. First, you murdered your father and brother, accumulated wealth by using slave labor, and amassed further fortune by exploiting the Forest’s Edge denizen— I wonder what kind of future you have in store for us."<br/>
"……"<br/>
"Of the three Count houses, the Turan house is the most powerful, and can even rival Marquis Genos. Hence, your next target will be the fortunes of the Marquis Genos house. After monopolizing the food industry, you set your eyes on the steel market. Last month, you signed a contract with a Jaguar steel merchant from Zealand."<br/>
He was probably talking about the merchant group led by Dell’s father.<br/>
"The exclusive contract with the Zealand steel merchants was for the supply of cookware and weapons to the city. Are you going to target the stones and construction industry next? And seize all the profits in the market while Marquis Marstein Genos is distracted by his work, Lord Pyschkurewuss?"<br/>
"… Baseless slanders…"<br/>
I could feel a dark miasma coming out from Pyschkurewuss’ petite body.<br/>
His light colored eyes had a feral-like gaze.<br/>
In contrast, Kamyua Yost had a faint smile:<br/>
"If there are no evidence, then all my deductions can be brushed off by calling it slander. Honestly, I could only impeach you with this incident that happened ten years ago. If I can prove this crime to be true, then the match is decided. Your sentencing will then be decided by Marquis Genos."<br/>
"… Fools! Who will believe a mongol like you who has Mahildra blood in your veins!"<br/>
Shileru exploded again.<br/>
"Lord Xylas! Please share your opinion as the Chief Justice! Give these outlaws a lashing and exile them from Genos!"<br/>
"… If you are saying this man is guilty of insulting a noble, then I will try him in accordance to the laws of Genos."<br/>
The old man said calmly:<br/>
"However— before we do that, we will need to have a proper trial with regards to that incident ten years ago, that Kamyua Yost mentioned."<br/>
"What!? Don’t be ridiculous! That’s just his retarded attempt to set me up!"<br/>
"Then we have to prove him wrong. That’s why we have a witness with us."<br/>
With that, Xylas glanced at Barcia.<br/>
"When the trial formally begins, let us bear witness on who is telling the truth, Barcia or you."<br/>
"Bollocks! How can the words of a mere bandit compare with a noble!?"<br/>
"The bandit confessed her crime, and then revealed your crimes. Her words have enough weight."<br/>
"Lord Xylas, aren’t you— a distant relative of the Count Satolas house?"<br/>
Shileru pressed the issue.<br/>
Pyschkurewuss closed his eyes again as Shileru’s emotions erupted.<br/>
"The Count Satolas house was incited by the second son of the Count Taliem house, and bared their fangs towards the Count Turan House! Are you all trying to do the Count Turan House in with your schemes!?"<br/>
"That’s baseless ramblings. I’m not here as a member of the Count Satolas house, but as the Chief Justice of Genos."<br/>
"How can I trust you!? The goal of you lot is to rob the wealth of the Count Turan House! You are all munto beasts that feed on carrions!"<br/>
Xylas frowned his white brows to express his displeasure.<br/>
"Sir Shileru, please watch your words. Compared to the reasonable questions raised by the tribal chiefs of Forest’s Edge, your language is vulgar, resort to intimidation and avoid answering the questions. Even before a formal judgement is reached, it is clear which side is more logical."<br/>
"Who cares about the Forest’s Edge! They are just barbarian that feeds on the deplorable kiba!"<br/>
Shileru had completely lost it.<br/>
Xylas shut his mouth with a sour face, and Kamyua Yost spoke with a smile on his behalf:<br/>
"Captain of the Towns Guard, Sir Shileru, the truth is, we don’t have any deciding proof either. In that sense, you can think of my words as just baseless slander."<br/>
Shileru looked at Kamyua Yost with confused eyes.<br/>
Kamyua Yost squinted his eyes and looked at him with a smile:<br/>
"All the crimes I mentioned couldn’t be done without you and Lord Pyschkurewuss working together closely. As the head of the Count Turan House is Lord Pyschkurewuss, so I kept referring to him as the mastermind— but my impression of that changed after meeting you for the first time."<br/>
"……"<br/>
"Could it be… The mastermind behind this isn’t Lord Pyschkurewuss, but you, Sir Shileru?"<br/>
The moment Kamyua Yost said that— Shileru reached for his waist. On his waist was a round silver accessory, and didn’t appear to be a weapon.<br/>
Instead of a weapon, it was something like a bell. Shileru shook it, and the drapes behind him was drawn to the left and right.<br/>
Just as Ai Fa sensed earlier, there were tens of guards behind the drapes, and they had drawn their bows fully.<br/>
Shileru laughed cockily: "Don’t move! If you move, all of you will go and meet Selva!"<br/>
Xylas groaned: "Damn it…"<br/>
"A-Are you insane, Sir Shileru? Lord Malfreed, and the child from the Marquis Banam house are here…"<br/>
"Peerage don’t matter to dead people! My foolish father and elder brother are testaments to that!"<br/>
Shileru roared as he pulled his fat body behind his chair.<br/>
Was that large chair reinforced with steel plates to protect him from bolts?<br/>
Half of the soldiers leaned forth and the other half took a stance above their comrades. There were 30 of them, and if they fired their arrows, there would be no place to hide in the room.<br/>
"Foolish Kamyua Yost! And… the ones tricked by him! After the Count Turan House destroy you, we will rule Genos forever!"<br/>
Beside the crazed Shileru, Pyschkurewuss closed his eyes again. His smile was gone from his greenish black face. His face void of any expression looked like an old and frail patient.<br/>
After that, Ai Fa and the hunters of the Forest’s Edge— flame of rage burst out of their eyes, and none of them faltered.<br/>
"You are confessing before we even interrogate you, huh."<br/>
Kamyua Yost said casually:<br/>
"That saves me the trouble… However, you can’t escape from your crimes. You are just deepening your sins."<br/>
"Shut up! All of you will die here!"<br/>
"You really want to make enemies of the Marquis Genos house and Marquis Banam house? Even if you are from a Count house, you will still be sentenced to death."<br/>
"… The Forest’s Edge Tribal Chief attempted to attack us during the conference. We merely ordered the soldiers to retaliate with arrows to protect ourselves."<br/>
Shileru wet his lips with his tongue, and said with his murky voice that seemed to take all his strength.<br/>
"Unfortunately, Lord Malfreed and our guest from Banam were dragged into the fight… Marquis Genos will be devastated to lose his precious heir."<br/>
"I see. That’s why you confiscated Malfreed’s blades. But Malfreed is as formidable as a Forest’s Edge hunter—"<br/>
"Enough talk!"<br/>
Shileru shook his bell again.<br/>
All the bows fired at the same time— I thought I would see that, but I didn’t. When the bell rang, someone kicked my chair and I fell down. As I nursed my back, I heard two sounds. First was someone groaning, and the other was the grass flute whistling by a denizen of Forest’s Edge.<br/>
"…Asuta, are you hurt?"<br/>
Ai Fa’s voice came from above.<br/>
The one who kicked my chair was Ai Fa. I looked up, and saw Ai Fa kneeling beside me. In her hand was the stool with a few arrows embedded in it. Since there was no place to hide, she used the stool to block the arrows. We were just 5 to 6 meters from the soldiers, and her reflex and physical abilities were amazing.<br/>
I looked around while I was still down, and all the hunters protected themselves and their comrades in the same way. Graff Zaza and Dali Sauti stood before the Tsun clan members like a pair of Nioh, Malfreed protected Xylas and Barcia guarded Wellhyde.<br/>
I breathed out in relief, and Kamyua Yost’s voice entered my ears.<br/>
"Well, that was dangerous. I didn’t expect them to act so forcefully."<br/>
I was wondering why he sounded so close, and saw Kamyua Yost crawling behind me.<br/>
He hid Leito in his cloak like a child. With no stool to use as shields, Kamyua Yost prone behind Ai Fa to seek refuge.<br/>
"W-Where’s P-Pyschkurewuss and the others—?"<br/>
"It’s fine. An unexpected guest came."<br/>
I didn’t understand what he was staying and stood up. An unexpected scene appeared before my eyes.<br/>
Shileru’s fat body hung in mid air. The one holding him was Donda Wu. Donda Wu stood in the middle of the hall, his left hand holding a stool covered in arrows, and his right hand grabbing Shileru’s chest.<br/>
"How dare you try to harm my comrades, villain."<br/>
Donda Wu’s thunder-like voice made Shileru whimpered and tremble. His heavy chair had fallen over right by their feet.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Pyschkurewuss was deprived of his freedom too.<br/>
I looked over the shoulder of someone in hunter’s garb putting a scimitar at Pyschkurewuss’ throat. He had red fluffy hair and slender limbs— Even from behind, I could tell that the Marsala hunter had captured Pyschkurewuss.<br/>
Barcia asked quietly: "Geta… What are you doing here?"<br/>
Geta didn’t answer.<br/>
The one who answered her was Ai Fa, who was helping me up while holding a stool cautiously.<br/>
"He was hiding in the ceiling. He showed his presence several times, didn’t you notice Barcia of Marsala."<br/>
"It’s regrettable, but I didn’t notice at all. It seems that I’m no match for my foolish son."<br/>
Barcia hung her head low, and her profile had a hint of sadness.<br/>
"Geta, don’t hurt that man. What we want isn’t vengeance, but justice."<br/>
Geta didn’t respond.<br/>
Hiding in the ceiling means— he heard about Barcia’s resolve. I held my breath when I realized his feelings.<br/>
Donda Wu said sternly: "… What will you do now? Your master has fallen into my hands."<br/>
The soldiers before us was ready to fire a second volley, but they stood stiffly in place as if they were petrified.<br/>
"Your puny arrows can’t seal our lips. Want to try drawing the blades on your waists? What ever you choose… the results will be the same."<br/>
I couldn’t see the expression on the soldiers’ faces as they were obscured by their helmets.<br/>
I could feel several of them peeking at Malfreed.<br/>
"What are you doing… Kill them all!"<br/>
Shileru wailed as he hung in midair:<br/>
"You all shot at Malfreed! If you don’t kill them, all of you will be hanged! If you don’t want to die, then kill them all!"<br/>
"No, Shileru alone will be responsible for this treason."<br/>
Malfreed said without any emotions.<br/>
"The Townsguard can’t defy a direct order. But this man has been removed from his post of Captain. You only need to obey the orders of the Castle Guards Captain, which is me."<br/>
"Don’t believe his lies! If you put down your weapon, all your families and friends will get executed!"<br/>
The drawn bows wavered, as if they were searching for a target.<br/>
At this moment, someone opened the door, and Jimon ran in. No, Jimon didn’t enter on his own volition. He collapsed on the rug and started moaning in pain.<br/>
"Hahaha! We really wrecked the place, Donda Wu! I was afraid that I won’t have the chance to shine!"<br/>
It was Dan Lutim.<br/>
Ludo Wu, Darum Wu and the others also barged in with sabers and machetes.<br/>
"What’s this, I thought you wanted to crash in through the windows, Dan Lutim?"<br/>
When he heard Dali Sauti’s question, Dan Lutim started laughing again:<br/>
"All the windows in this room are barred! So I climbed into the window in the next room and came in from there! Dick Dom’s group has beaten off the soldiers below the window!"<br/>
Dan Lutim then rubbed his round nose:<br/>
"But this really reeks! It’s easy to use, but the Lutim house don’t need this kiba repelling fruit!"<br/>
I had already forgotten about that stench, but Dan Lutim must have found this room through the scent of that kiba repelling fruit. He then rushed over with at Kaslan Lutim’s flute signal.<br/>
Anyway, the match has been decided.<br/>
Dan Lutim, Ludo Wu, Darum Wu and Rau Lei stood before us with their blades and fury in their eyes. Just the four of them were enough to keep the 30 soldiers in check, that’s how intimidating they were.<br/>
"… Lower your weapons and yield. I give you my word, those who follow my orders will be pardoned."<br/>
On Malfreed’s orders, the soldiers lowered their bows.<br/>
"You morons!"<br/>
Shileru roared as Donda Wu flung him onto the ground.<br/>
Shileru rolled around like a dying toad.<br/>
"You are Malfreed, right. Son of the Genos landlord, I have a question for you."<br/>
Donda Wu slowly turned to Malfreed and said:<br/>
"The crimes of Shileru is clear as day. But we still have not figured out how heavy the crimes of Pyschkurewuss are… Do we still have to communicate with the Landlord of Genos through him?"<br/>
"…Shileru’s crimes are clear, but Lord Pyschkurewuss’ sin will need to be determined through a trial."<br/>
A cold light shone in Malfreed’s grey eyes, and he answered:<br/>
"Before the trial ends, he would be relieved of all official duties as per Genos law."<br/>
"I see. However… he could push everything to his brother and escape a conviction."<br/>
"No, he won’t escape the hammer of justice unless he is truly innocent."<br/>
An unfamiliar voice interjected.<br/>
Rau Lei who was closest to the door cast his sharp gaze outside.<br/>
"Who goes there? Are there more soldiers?"<br/>
A group in white armor and a chilling air entered the hall. Ludo Wu quickly faced the new group of soldiers, but they just formed a rank and stopped with precision comparable to a machine.<br/>
After that— a tall man walked forth from that group.<br/>
It was a middle aged man with light brown hair. He had a tidy beard and a lean body. He wore a collared Jaguar style shirt without any frills, simple pants and a refreshing smile on his face.<br/>
Although he was in Jaguar attire, he was a westerner with yellowish brown skin. He was a confident noble that wasn’t too old.<br/>
"Oh, long time no see, Sir Wellhyde. I haven’t seen you since the wedding of Marquis Banam’s eldest son. I’m glad to see you are well."<br/>
Wellhyde who was looking at Donda Wu and the others speak with a pale face suddenly lowered his head. The soldiers who lowered their bows also sound shocked.<br/>
"I already ordered the guards outside to lay down their arms. Our Forest’s Edge comrades aren’t hurt, so please be at ease."<br/>
Donda Wu glared at that man without a word.<br/>
Kamyua Yost beside me said with a pretentious attitude:<br/>
"What brings you here? I never thought a lazy ass like you will come."<br/>
"What the hell was that? You are the one who sent a messenger to tell me Sir Wellhyde is here. It had already come to this, so how can I continue sitting on my thumb?"<br/>
When he saw Geta holding a blade to Pyschkurewuss’ throat, he sighed softly:<br/>
"It is regrettable that things turned out this way, Lord Pyschkurewuss. You are very capable in your capacity as the Count of Turan, just thinking about the future gives me a headache."<br/>
Pyschkurewuss who laid weakly on his chair opened his eyes slowly. There wasn’t any life in his greenish black face, and his wrinkled skin was filled with sweat.<br/>
"… Is this the end for me…?"<br/>
"Yes. I will take care of the aftermath, so don’t worry and wait for your judgement."<br/>
Donda Wu interjected: "Hmmp… I want to know how you will do that."<br/>
Everyone had probably guessed the true identity of this person. He bowed towards Donda Wu with a smile:<br/>
"If I’m not mistaken, you must be one of the new tribal chiefs of Forest’s Edge. The first thing I need to do is to build a cordial relationship with you. In the name of Marquis Marstein Genos… I offer my sincere apologies for my earlier lack of manners."<br/>
After spending 80 days in the Forest’s Edge settlement— I finally met the man with the highest authority in Genos.<br/>
But his gaze didn’t rest on me. It will be days before I speak with him face to face.<br/>
In any case, the third conference between Pyschkurewuss and the tribal chiefs of the Forest’s Edge ended chaotically<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
