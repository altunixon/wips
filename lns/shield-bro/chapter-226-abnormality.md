Abnormality<br/>
Elena: "Oh, well isn’t it the Hero of Shield"<br/>
Naofumi: "You are-"<br/>
At the town’s clinic, was someone that I knew.<br/>
If I remember right, she was one of Motoyasu’s companion, Elena.<br/>
Like before she was attentive and calm, even as a clinic receptionist.<br/>
Her personality when she was a companion of Motoyasu seemed like a complete lie.<br/>
Naofumi: "Why are you here?"<br/>
Elena: "To help my parents"<br/>
Now that I think about it, her mother was a merchant.<br/>
And I recall her saying that she might come and visit my land soon.<br/>
Elena: "While I was going to your town, I somehow was attacked by bandits but I was saved. I believe the one who helped me was the demi-human right next to you."<br/>
Elena: "Just as I thought, the nice man that saved me was you! You have my utmost gratitude"<br/>
You already have gone under a class up, so fight them yourself.<br/>
Elena explained that while she was under attack by the bandits, Imia’s Uncle protected her and let her escape, but he sustained pretty bad injuries in the process.<br/>
When we found Imia’s uncle, he was covered in wounds and his carriage was nowhere to be found.<br/>
Even though Imia’s uncle should be at the level where he can easily protect himself.<br/>
Imia’s Uncle: "You shouldn’t worry about me. If anything I should be more concerned about the sparks from the forge."<br/>
Naofumi: "I see"<br/>
Imia’s Uncle: "Also…I was debating whether to tell the Hero of the Shield this, but the bandit was well-dressed despite being a bandit, though I could be mistaken. "<br/>
Hmmm…Right now, I am more concerned about the condition of Imia’s Uncle.<br/>
Should I tell the Old Man of the Weapon store?<br/>
For now, I decided to wait and see what kind of state he was in.<br/>
Naofumi: "For now, I’ll keep quiet about your condition."<br/>
Imia’s Uncle: "Yes!"<br/>
Naofumi: "Elena, was it? It’s a shame but for the time being please help out with the investigation"<br/>
Elena: "Ah, of course. I also recall a place that was very suspicious"<br/>
Naofumi: "To make sure your innocence, we will go and investigate it"<br/>
Melty immediately had sent her subordinates to investigate the incident, as to ensure that no false charges were made.<br/>
As we talked with the receptionist, we explained the situation.<br/>
Afterwords, she showed us the way to the healer.<br/>
At the examination room, Imia’s uncle underwent a treatment of recovery magic.<br/>
Imia’s Uncle: "Ugh…"<br/>
Imia’s uncle had lacerations covering his body, they were quite bloody.<br/>
Imia’s Uncle: "I’m fine…is what I would like to say"<br/>
To help with the treatment, I took out some medicine as it can work in combination with the magic.<br/>
Imia’s Uncle: "Hey, Hero…"<br/>
Feebly, Imia’s uncle tried to talk with me.<br/>
Imia’s Uncle: "I would like… to apologize… All the effort we put in…was stolen so easily"<br/>
Naofumi: "Don’t worry about. Its fine that it was taken. More importantly, I am glad that you are still alive."<br/>
Imia’s Uncle: "I’m so sorry… ugh…"<br/>
Imia’s uncle painfully grasped his head.<br/>
Would the old man be okay? The bandit’s blade may have been coated with poison.<br/>
I use an antidote just in case.<br/>
When the treatment had finished, Imia’s uncle’s condition had stabilized.<br/>
Looking at his body, you could see the traces of a stab wound and the remainder of a cut.<br/>
It did not look like it could be fatal…but it still seemed strange.<br/>
Recovering from this would be rough.<br/>
There was a possibility of him being under a curse, if so we might need holy water or the dragon pulse to completely cure him.<br/>
Right now Imia’s uncle is fast asleep.<br/>
Naofumi: "Well then…"<br/>
Since he is nearby, I should inform the Old Man of the Weapon shop on the current situation.<br/>
Since I can’t let them run free, I should go and immediately subjugate the bandits in the area.<br/>
Those who go against the shield would not be forgiven.<br/>
But for now, should I go report to the Old man of the Weapon shop?<br/>
Though I should refrain from saying too much.<br/>
Imia: "Uncle…"<br/>
Imia looks anxious while looking at her Uncle’s sleeping face.<br/>
Naofumi: "Don’t worry. His life isn’t in danger. Once he wakes up, you can take him to the village to recover."<br/>
Imia: "Okay…"<br/>
Naofumi: "Well then, I’m going to do a little bandit hunting"<br/>
Imia: "Okay!"<br/>
I won’t stand by and turn the other cheek.<br/>
I will hit back when hit.<br/>
To steal in my territory, you better be prepared to lose everything.<br/>
While Imia is looking after her uncle, I leave with Firo, Atla and Rishia to the place that Elena informed us about.<br/>
It was near a forest at the edge of my territory.<br/>
It is along one of the routes I use to reach Castle town from my village.<br/>
Naofumi: "Firo, can you tell if there is anything here?"<br/>
Firo: "Hmm… There probably isn’t anyone around, I suppose?"<br/>
Hmmm.<br/>
I guess that they won’t be that easy to find.<br/>
Naofumi: "Their hideout might be nearby. Go look for it"<br/>
Rishia: "Yes"<br/>
Firo: "Yes~"<br/>
Naofumi: "Atla, can you sense anything?"<br/>
Atla: "Well… there seems to be some remnants of a malicious power"<br/>
Naofumi: "Malicious?"<br/>
Atla: "It is similar to the power that the Hero of the Spear had, as well as the Hero of the Sword…"<br/>
Naofumi: "Eh?"<br/>
It seems that Rishia noticed immediately.<br/>
As much as she tried to avoid it, she should have known that it was only a matter of time.<br/>
It seems like our encounter with Itsuki was vastly approaching.<br/>
But what could he gain from using bandits to steal from Imia’s uncle?<br/>
It is possible that it was under Witch’s influence that caused the attack on the Demi-Human.<br/>
But…for Elena not to notice would be strange.<br/>
Anyway, how did Imia’s Uncle normally bring shields to me?<br/>
Though I was unable to ask him, it could have been with a push cart.<br/>
Also, Imia’s uncle did not have anything else on him.<br/>
And Elena wasn’t at the scene of the crime, so she didn’t know where they fled.<br/>
I can’t expand the search area.<br/>
Naofumi: "Anyway, I do not know what they are planning. So everyone be careful"<br/>
Rishia: "U-Understood"<br/>
Atla: "Yes"<br/>
Firo: "Yes~"<br/>
Well, ambushing Atla and Firo would be impossible.<br/>
Just in case, I activate Meteor Shield, in the off chance they do launch a surprise attack.<br/>
We spent rest of the day searching, but we were unable to find a single thing.<br/>
Naofumi: "Was it a waste of time?"<br/>
I went back to the town to inform Melty of the situation.<br/>
For the time being, we will let everyone now that there are bandits in the area.<br/>
If I’m lucky, an adventurer will take care of the bandits.<br/>
Melty: "Ah, that’s right. There is something I think Naofumi-san should know"<br/>
Naofumi: "What?"<br/>
Melty: "Lately, there have been less people visiting and leaving the town."<br/>
Naofumi: "Is something going on?"<br/>
Melty: "Now that you mention it…there is something strange going on…Some merchants have suddenly become rather unfriendly, and they seemed like different people"<br/>
Naofumi: "Hmmm…"<br/>
Somehow, I have a bad feeling about all these strange incidents, as if there were indirect attacks.<br/>
Is what I would want to believe.<br/>
Melty: "I have contacted Mother about it, but it is possible that we were infiltrated by a spy"<br/>
Naofumi: "Is security that bad?"<br/>
Melty: "It isn’t bad, rather it seems strange. It best to be careful"<br/>
Naofumi: "I know. But you should be careful too, since you are the next in-line Queen, it would be best to increase your guards"<br/>
You could tell that Melty was nervous.<br/>
I decided to part ways with Melty and Firo, and return to the village.<br/>
Naofumi: "I’ll be going now"<br/>
Melty: "Oh, then take care"<br/>
I saw Ren unloading luggage from the carriage.<br/>
Since they were with a Hero, they all seemed safe.<br/>
Rather, I want to ask him if he saw anyone suspicious.<br/>
Naofumi: "There seems to be bandits in the area you were in, did you have any trouble with them?"<br/>
Ren: "No? There was nothing out of the ordinary"<br/>
It seems like Ren didn’t encounter them.<br/>
Ren: "However, I was able to understand my curse a bit better"<br/>
Naofumi: "Ooh…"<br/>
Ren: "Apparently, I won’t gain any experience points that I earned through fighting"<br/>
The Curse of Gluttony.<br/>
I believe the price paid was only a large drop in experience but is seems that it may also stop any experience gain.<br/>
Naofumi: "Was I nearby when you fought?"<br/>
"Ah"<br/>
Before this, I tried investigating the penalties of the Four Saint Heroes with Motoyasu.<br/>
It turns out that experience would not be gained if another Hero was nearby as they would interfere with each other’s growth.<br/>
There may be other penalties, but the experience loss was the most concerning issue.<br/>
As long as there isn’t another Hero within range of one kilometer, the experience gained would fine.<br/>
The area wasn’t small, but quite large.<br/>
This area would not allow any experience gained by fighting.<br/>
Of course, to be that far away and be affected, would not normally be possible.<br/>
But Ren was outside of that range so the possibility it was his curse was quite high.<br/>
Really now, to be hit by the effects of two curses, Ren sure has it tough.<br/>
Well, as long as he puts in some serious effort, even with a little curse, he should have no difficulties.<br/>
Naofumi: "Did Female Knight and Taniko go in already?"<br/>
Ren: "Taniko? Is that what you call Windia?"<br/>
Ren that bastard, does he not know any of the nicknames I’ve given?<br/>
Well, I guess its fine.<br/>
Naofumi: "Yeah. So, did they enter or not?"<br/>
Ren: "No, it was only me"<br/>
Naofumi: "I see"<br/>
Well, they would normally come back soon, since I can trust them to that extent.<br/>
Naofumi: "Ren, there are some guys trying to do something in my territory. One of my subordinates was attacked and suffered grievous wounds. Be cautious"<br/>
Ren: "What? I-I understand. I’ll help out as much as possible. Just say the word"<br/>
Naofumi: "Is that so. Then I’ll leave patrolling to you"<br/>
Ren: "You can count on me"<br/>
I gave the Hero of the Sword the duty to patrol. As it should be something that he can handle.<br/>
I should also be on guard.<br/>
Naofumi: "That reminds me, the others haven’t returned yet"<br/>
I look around restlessly, for the other group that went peddling today.<br/>
Now that I think about it, those guys that left two to three days ago still haven’t come back.<br/>
Did they run away?<br/>
Just in case, I check on the status of the slaves.<br/>
…?<br/>
I both see it and don’t… what’s going on. It seems to be slightly flickering while being filled with static.<br/>
They are alive, and they haven’t violated any orders, but…?<br/>
Naofumi: "That reminds me, Kiel isn’t here either"<br/>
She should have gone peddling in the morning.<br/>
Rather than taking one of the many Philorials, she went out with a Caterpilland.<br/>
Its hard to imagine that loincloth wearing dog who would eat a fallen crepe off the ground, to run away.<br/>
Though I can’t deny the possibility that it was all an act, but the reason for leaving the village was weak.<br/>
And it makes more sense to obey all my orders if you were a spy.<br/>
Taniko: "The Caterpilland has come back!"<br/>
Eh?<br/>
Looks like I was worried for no reason.<br/>
But, as I turned around I was left speechless by a scream.<br/>
Taniko: "What happened!?"<br/>
Taniko was screaming as she rushed over.<br/>
The Caterpilland came back, completely covered in wounds.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
