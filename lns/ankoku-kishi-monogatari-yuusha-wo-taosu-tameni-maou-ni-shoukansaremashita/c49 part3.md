Chapter 49.3 : The Town of Freedom Fighter<br/>
In that sense, Teseshia was a City of Freedom.<br/>
Once we arrived at the headquarters of the Freedom Fighter Association, Chairman Snefowl introduced us to a girl by his side.<br/>
「Hero of Light-sama, this is one of our Freedom Fighters, Shizufaeria.」<br/>
「It’s nice to meet you again, Hero-sama.」<br/>
The girl placed her hand on her chest and bowed to us.<br/>
I did recall meeting her before. She should be the one that was attacked by the Orcs.<br/>
Shizufaeria was requested to act as our guide.<br/>

To be honest, Clasus had first requested Godan, who stood behind Shizufaeria.<br/>
It seemed that he was the best Freedom Fighter in the city and would have no problem entering the labyrinth due to his extensive experience with the labyrinth.<br/>
However, because of what he tried to do to Sahoko a few days ago he was blacklisted. Reiji had been so angry he requested a change of the guide.<br/>
   [TL: F%CK, AND YOU TOLD OTHER MEN TO SHUT UP WHEN YOU SLEPT WIth THEIR WOMEN!!] <br/>
He took the opportunity to demand that the next guide be a cute girl.<br/>
It was my opinion that there were almost zero cute girls among the Freedom Fighters, but I definitely didn’t wish to have a sweaty, burly man as our guide.<br/>
The guide had to at least have a slightly better face than Godan.<br/>
[TL: Poor Godan, even though you were born with that face]<br/>
That was where Shizufaeria came in.<br/>
She had a considerably cute appearance, long chestnut-colored hair, and a thin but not very tall frame. In short, she was cute.<br/>
At least there would be no complaints from Reiji.<br/>
Nevertheless, Shizufaeria’s arms were far thinner than other Freedom Fighter girls. Could she even swing a sword with such thin arms?<br/>

<br/>
<br/>
To be honest, she didn’t seem to be someone who was still growing as a Freedom Fighter at all. Her face and appearance told me she was raised in a warm family.<br/>
Even her name didn’t have a Freedom Fighter-like ring to it.<br/>
The Shizu in Shizufaeria meant calm and Faeria was referring to the Goddess Faeria. Her mother was definitely a follower of the Faeria faith.<br/>
Goddess Faeria, the wife of God King Oudith, was the goddess of marriage and family. Her existence was worlds apart from war and battle.<br/>
If her parents were Freedom Fighters, there would be no way they’d name their daughter Shizufaeria.<br/>
I assumed she was the daughter of a knight or noble house of a destroyed country somewhere.<br/>
Her parents must’ve come to Teseshia after their homeland was destroyed by demons. Such tales aren’t that rare.<br/>
「It’s nice to meet you, Shizufaeria.」<br/>
Reiji took Shizufaeria’s hand, and her face turned bright red. It seemed she had little to no experience with men.<br/>
By appearance, Reiji was like a prince and seemed to have a good head over his shoulders. That was why most women fell for him.<br/>

<br/>
<br/>
But inside, he was a completely lecherous beast.<br/>
Maybe this girl would become one of Reiji’s victims, too. As long as I was around, I could prevent him from laying his hands on various girls. I couldn’t prevent him from doing so when I wasn’t around though.<br/>
Although I knew it was practically impossible to stop him from flirting with girls left and right, I still tried to stop him whenever I could.<br/>
Reiji’s indecent attitude was already getting out of control.<br/>
It was already extremely difficult for me to hear Sahoko’s vivacious voice in the middle of the night while we traveled together.<br/>
I was lucky I shared a room with Shirone during the journey. I still couldn’t believe how Shirone could sleep soundly with such loud moans as background noise.<br/>
It seemed that Shirone simply didn’t care about what Reiji did to other girls.<br/>
Despite having known her for a long time, I still couldn’t understand Shirone’s attitude sometimes.<br/>
「Please call me Shizufae, Reiji-sama. You may order me as you like.」<br/>
Shizufae bowed to Reiji.<br/>
Thus, we secured a guide. We would go to the labyrinth tomorrow.<br/>
◆ Hero of Fire, Novis<br/>
Yesterday was a nightmare.<br/>

<br/>
<br/>
I was bedridden for the whole day and, thanks to that, I couldn’t do anything.<br/>
Thus, the majority of the cleaning up yesterday were left to the Hero of Light and his companions.<br/>
I felt useless despite being hailed as the Hero of Fire.<br/>
That Godan guy’s injury was lighter than mine, thus he returned to Teseshia last night.<br/>
I strolled around Teseshia. The townscape was the same as the one in my childhood memories.<br/>
I wondered how Shizufae was doing. She made a stop before she went to Ariadya but it was for an escort job. She might have gone back already.<br/>
Suddenly I was embraced from behind as someone called my name.<br/>
「Yo~, Vi~s ♪!」<br/>
「B-Big Sis Keyna?! You almost got me there! 」<br/>
Keyna was my childhood friend. It had been a while since I last met her.<br/>
Because of a nominated commission from the northern country, I went by myself and left behind my other comrades. For a certain reason they couldn’t leave Teseshia.<br/>
The last time I met Big Sis Kenya was a month ago.<br/>

     (adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({});<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
「What a rude thing to say. Who do you think was the one who made you a man? 」<br/>
Big Sis Keyna smiled mischievously.<br/>
「Uuuuh…」<br/>
I couldn’t do anything but groan in sorrow.<br/>
Honestly, Big Sis Keyna was someone I could never win against.<br/>
I was born and raised in the Faeria Temple along with Big Sis Keyna.<br/>
I didn’t know anything about my parents.<br/>
Big Sis Keyna was picked up by Shizufae’s father and was entrusted to the Faeria Temple.<br/>
I, Shizufae, and Big Sis Keyna were raised like siblings. In short, Big Sis Keyna knew just about everything about my embarrassing childhood.<br/>
「Big Sis… Please don’t say that to Shizufae…」<br/>
I had bitter memories of being prostrated in front of Big Sis Kenya while she smiled delightfully as she taught me about various things.  [TL: taught what?] <br/>
Thus, I never regretted it.<br/>
But Shizufae could snap if she knew about it. That matter was an absolute secret between us.<br/>
Big Sis Keyna couldn’t hold back her laugh as she patted me on my back.<br/>
「Ka~y!! I won’t tell Shizufae. That girl is too stubborn, after all.」<br/>
「Come to think of it, what about Shizufae? Has she returned to Teseshia? 」<br/>
「Hm? Shizufae has returned, too. She should be in the association right now.」<br/>
「The association? 」<br/>
All Freedom Fighters had to register themselves in the association to get the permit to operate in the area. And they had to register themselves again once every three years.<br/>
But she wasn’t supposed to be registering again this year.<br/>
Why did she go to the association?<br/>
「Ah, she went along with Godan, the Hero of Earth. He didn’t tell us the reason for calling her, though.」<br/>
The way Big Sis Keyna described it worried me even more.<br/>
「WAIT A MINUTE!! DID YOU SAY GODAN?! THEN SHIZUFAE IS IN DANGER FOR SURE!!! 」<br/>
I knew Godan was the violent man I met yesterday. Shizufae’s body was in danger. I was about to run toward the association when Big Sis Keyna stopped me on in tracks.<br/>
「Oioioi, what’s the matter, Novis? No matter how absurd Godan is, he is still a member of the association.」<br/>
「I know that, but still… Big Sis Keyna. What if something really happened? 」<br/>
「 Shizufae isn’t that kind of person. When it comes to swordplay, she’s even better than Novis or me.」<br/>
[TL: Something is strange here, Keyna actually using “Ore” instead of “Watashi”]<br/>
As she said, Shizufae’s swordplay was way better than mine.<br/>
The problem was her lack of strength. In fact, she couldn’t even cut a goblin with her current power. But that critical problem was resolved with a magic sword.<br/>
Even someone like Godan couldn’t do anything to her as long as she used her magic sword.<br/>
「It’s another story if Shizufae allowed it herself. It would be a different matter if the other party was the Hero of Light but I think Shizufae will simply ignore Godan.」<br/>
Big Sis Keyna smiled at me.<br/>
I’ve heard about the Hero of Light. I mean, JUST yesterday I went through THAT nightmarish experience at the hands of the Saint, the comrade of the Hero of Light.<br/>
I heard he was a pretty boy and was far more powerful than the Saint.<br/>
All his comrades were women with beauty on the same level as the Saint.<br/>
I still remembered the soft feeling of the Saint’s boobs.<br/>
To be honest, I was extremely envious of the man who could always enjoy those wondrous boobs. Even Shizufae’s boobs weren’t as big as the Saint’s.<br/>
Nevertheless, why was Big Sis Keyna suddenly talking about the Hero of Light?<br/>
Godan was a clumsy, rock-headed man. Shizufae wouldn’t let someone like him do something strange to her body.<br/>
「You’re right.」<br/>
I agreed with her, but I couldn’t stop worrying about Shizufae. However, even with my Hero status, I’d be in trouble if I suddenly raided the association.<br/>
Hence why Big Sis Keyna stopped me from acting recklessly.<br/>
I was worried to death about Shizufae, but I didn’t want Big Sis Keyna worrying about me.<br/>
「Atta boy, Novis. It’s been a while since the last time we met, so let’s grab some drinks to celebrate.」<br/>
Big sis Keyna entangled her left arm around my neck. My face was unexpectedly buried into her soft and tender breast.<br/>
And thus, I was pulled along by her.<br/>
