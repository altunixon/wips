16-41. [Judicial Nation] Sheriffald (5)<br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
Satou here. Things that are right to you may not necessarily apply to everyone. Self-righteousness sure can easily run wild, surprisingly enough.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
◇<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
"To reiterate, you claim that the people on this list have created a fictitious crime syndicate known as Dujii to be a cover to conceal their criminal activities?"<br/>
<br/>
The Chief of Judicial Bureau sighed as he looked at the list.<br/>
After we were done with preparations, I got to the Central Judicial Bureau through the Main Urion Temple's miko's connection.<br/>
<br/>
The Chief's name isn't on this list.<br/>
<br/>
"However, I only have evidence for around half of them--"<br/>
"And those evidence are?"<br/>
"That will be for the Trial before God."<br/>
<br/>
After I told the Chief that, the henchmen who had their names on the list all began to verbally abuse me.<br/>
Well, I pay them no heed so I've got not clue what they're saying.<br/>
<br/>
"Why not, we should accept it, Chief. It will be a good chance to prove our innocence in front of God and other members of diet."<br/>
<br/>
The man who said that was the one whose name is on top of the list, the handsome vice-chief.<br/>
The Chief turned a dubious look at the guy's unexpected remark.<br/>
<br/>
"Our innocence will be guaranteed by the 『Golden Scale』."<br/>
<br/>
The lackeys open their mouth all at once after the confident remark of the vice-chief.<br/>
<br/>
"T-that's right! Those participating in the Trial before God are our cohorts, ladies and gentlemen with judicial qualification!"<br/>
"They will surely believe in our innocence!"<br/>
"The Scale is always on our side!"<br/>
<br/>
I'm sure they know about the Golden Scale's mechanism too.<br/>
<br/>
"Sir Pendragon, we will acknowledge the exercise of Trial before God. However, I assume you are aware that if you were to lose in this trial, that is the same as throwing mud in the honored faces of your country administrative?"<br/>
"Yes, of course. Whether it's a fine in the number that rivals national budget, or the magic sword Demon Slayer that's slain a demon lord, we would yield you any item you so desired as a reimbursement if it ever comes to that."<br/>
<br/>
Oh crap, Deception skill went haywire for a bit there.<br/>
There's no such thing as magic sword Demon Slayer, I've gotta make one later.<br/>
<br/>
"Very well--"<br/>
<br/>
The Chief gave his agreement after looking at my face for a while.<br/>
The flow of events so far happened exactly like we had arranged last night.<br/>
<br/>
"--Vice Chief Bupa and you guys, you are fine with it, correct?"<br/>
"Yes, everything under the just law."<br/>
<br/>
The vice-chief replied sarcastically at the Chief.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
◇<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
『Arisa, they acknowledged the trial here. How's the preparation for the guest over there, ready to go?』<br/>
『You betcha! I got it under control quick.』<br/>
<br/>
I'm talking with Arisa through space magic [Telephone].<br/>
Even though it was a sudden visit on her part, looks like Arisa cleared it with her charm.<br/>
<br/>
『Coming too fast would throw a wrench in this plan, make sure to match the timing okay.』<br/>
『OK, wanna match our clock so there won't be any [margin of error]?』<br/>
<br/>
Arisa was seemingly referencing something but since I couldn't recall what it was from, I gave her some random "Yeah let's", and changed the call to the next person.<br/>
<br/>
『Satou-san, her highness Sistina's golems are helping with the installation over here, we should be able to make it in time.』<br/>
『Thank you, Sera-san.』<br/>
<br/>
Looks like they're done with installing a device that telecasts video at the plaza.<br/>
It will be showing masterpiece paintings and world's pretty scenery until the appointed time.<br/>
There should be quite a crowd gathered by the time the trial starts.<br/>
<br/>
『Forgive me, Satou-san. I'm still not done with the construction.』<br/>
<br/>
Zena-san gave that reply when I checked on her progress.<br/>
<br/>
『Was there a problem?』<br/>
『Yes actually, I saw the beastkin-san we helped in the first day getting chased by some hoodlums, so I went to save him...』<br/>
<br/>
Being unable to overlook oppression of the weak is truly like Zena-san.<br/>
<br/>
Apparently the people chasing the beastkin weren't the store manager in that trial but the human men who were working in the same store.<br/>
Zena-san suppressed those men and towed them to the guards.<br/>
<br/>
『I'll absolutely make sure to finish it before the time.』<br/>
『Please don't beat yourself over it. Don't worry, I'll send reinforcement your way, Zena-san.』<br/>
<br/>
Selecting personnel is my job.<br/>
After telling the sorry Zena-san not to worry about it, I ask Hikaru at the Solitary Island Palace for help.<br/>
<br/>
『You sure you want to let Shiga Kingdom be wide open?』<br/>
『No worries. There hasn't been any suspicious activity there for a while, and we have guard golems and Echigoya members around too.』<br/>
<br/>
After equipping Hikaru with anti-backdoor items like Arisa and Sera, I Unit Arranged her to the airship at the outskirts and tasked her to help Zena-san.<br/>
<br/>
--Chuii?<br/>
<br/>
When I saw ChuuFat who peeked out of my breast pocket, I remembered that the Sage Mice who make up the information network at Shiga Kingdom had come here.<br/>
<br/>
Well, it's not like we're living in some game or manga, no way the end would immediately begin the moment a flag was raised.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
◇<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
"--Under these suspicion, they are accused to be the ones behind Crime Syndicate Dujii."<br/>
<br/>
Boos and jeers erupted from people who also weren't in the list after the indictment was read aloud at the Trial before God. <br/>
The presiding judge was shouting, "Keep silent!" while waving around a handbell-like thing, but most couldn't shut their mouths.<br/>
<br/>
"Please keep it down."<br/>
<br/>
I silenced the bad mannered people with wind magic [Wide Area Silence].<br/>
As you'd expect from an anti-magician group spell, the effect is outstanding.<br/>
<br/>
I could have used [Compulsion (Geass)] skill if I wanted to, but that would faint people who tried to disobey it, so I refrained.<br/>
<br/>
I cancel the spell on people who are unrelated like the judge, the temple head and miko.<br/>
When I winked at the temple head, he noticed that his voice would come out, and then he proceeded to speak.<br/>
<br/>
"It appears that the disgrace displayed at the Trial before God has brought upon God Urion's wrath."<br/>
<br/>
With the temple head's declaration, the people in the hall turned pale.<br/>
<br/>
The huge Weasel Empire having been obliterated in a single night by way of Divine Punishment seems to be still fresh in their memories.<br/>
Even though my tale of demon lord slaying never reached here, news about the downfall of Weasel Empire probably did through Saga Empire.<br/>
<br/>
"Those who wish to let their voice be known, raise your hand and wait for my approval as a presiding judge before you speak out."<br/>
<br/>
Once the judge reminded them of something really obvious, I canceled [Wide Area Silence] on everyone.<br/>
<br/>
"Are you siding with that swindling foreigner hiding behind God's name! You traitor--"<br/>
<br/>
Suddenly, an old man who was a part of the booers began to sling abusive language along with his saliva, so I made him quiet for a bit with wind magic [Dyspnea].<br/>
This is an arranged version of wind magic [Suffocation] to make it non-fatal.<br/>
The target will breathe normally once they calm down, so this spell is perfect for these troublesome people.<br/>
<br/>
"Quiet. You are in God's presence. Once again--"<br/>
<br/>
The trial finally begins for real once the judge re-state his warning.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
◇<br/>
<TLN: If you're reading this novel at any other site than Sousetsuka .com you might be reading an unedited, uncorrected version of the novel.><br/>
<br/>
"--I understand the content of the indictment. However, aren't all the information come from rumors you've seen and heard, sire? Is that no difference than a false accusation then. Do you have evidence with you, sire?"<br/>
<br/>
Vice-chief objected politely.<br/>
The [Golden Scale] greatly tilted toward him, maybe thanks to his composure.<br/>
<br/>
Yup, just as planned.<br/>
<br/>
"Sir Pendragon, please submit your evidence."<br/>
"Very well. If you'd please witness this--<<Image Projection>>."<br/>
<br/>
I took out a mysterious glittering object from my breast pocket, and recited some convincing-sounding Command Words.<br/>
<br/>
This mysterious object is a gem made from processed special sap called Alua, it produces beautiful glittering light on the surface of the object if you circulate your mana into it.<br/>
By the way, this object is the latest creation of the up-and-coming artist, Tama-sensei.<br/>
<br/>
If I'm not mistaken the title was [Crowd Dancing Millet Jelly].<br/>
<br/>
While thinking about such, I produced a screen in the air and projected the footage recorded yesterday on it.<br/>
At the same time, I put up On-Screen Windows on top of the projection to display the crimes those people have committed.<br/>
<br/>
"""OOOOOOOOOOO"""<br/>
<br/>
While the audience was getting surprised, I added more display windows that had the recording details.<br/>
<br/>
"So you were the culprit of that incident!"<br/>
"You bastard, you were connected to the scoundrels who injured my uncle!"<br/>
"No, those pictures must be some kind of mistakes!"<br/>
"Come to think of it, I saw that guy coming out of your mansion!"<br/>
<br/>
The great hall of the Trial before God is wrapped in tumult of pandemonium.<br/>
Even the usually always calm judge seemed to be overwhelmed by the impact of the moving pictures.<br/>
<br/>
Well, since it's a world where recording equipment are artifacts you'd excavate from Furu Empire era, this reaction is probably only natural when they're shown near-futuristic screening like this.<br/>
<br/>
And thus, the [Golden Scale] scoops out the change in the audience's deep psyche and tilts toward me.<br/>
<br/>
My victory is all but guaranteed as long as this keeps up.<br/>
However, that would not satisfy the condition of God Urion's Trial then.<br/>
<br/>
The sound of a bell resounded once the [Golden Scale] completely tilted to one side.<br/>
<br/>
That sound greatly lowered the tumult volume.<br/>
<br/>
"Everyone, be quiet--"<br/>
<br/>
The Vice-chief calmed people down in place of the flustered judge.<br/>
I muted the sound while the footage is still rolling.<br/>
<br/>
Of course there were people who kept on hammering on without caring, so I shut them up with [Dyspnea] chantlessly.<br/>
<br/>
The vice-chief who had a refreshing martyr-like expression on his face continued on while pointing at the completely tilted scale.<br/>
<br/>
"--It appears that I cannot shirk away any longer from this. With our dignity as the watchdogs of law, let us confess to all our crimes and serve our sentence."<br/>
<br/>
The vice-chief called for the people around him.<br/>
The majority of those people were looking down on the ground in despair, but some were turning their eyes all over the places, still stubbornly trying to look for a way out.<br/>
<br/>
The Chief is glaring at that Vice-Chief with a puzzled expression.<br/>
He must have felt something odd with the Vice-Chief who acted too gallantly.<br/>
<br/>
The Chief glanced at me.<br/>
He might have sensed something wrong considering it went way too smooth.<br/>
<br/>
"Those who have objection may come forward. Otherwise, I will proceed to read the sentence."<br/>
<br/>
The judge announced that with a carrying voice.<br/>
<br/>
"Well then--"<br/>
<br/>
A sound of door getting violently flung open stopped the judge who was going to state the sentence.<br/>
<br/>
"--OBJECTION!"<br/>
<br/>
A boy donning blue colored armor stood in front of the door. <br/>
