<br/>
Interlude: Their Morning Together<br/>
I opened my eyes, and Ai Fa’s sleeping face appeared before me.<br/>
We were so close that my heart almost stopped.<br/>
Her pink lips were slightly open, making rhythmic breathing sounds. Her blonde eyelashes were long, and her similarly colored hair covered her forehead and cheeks like a decoration.<br/>
Ai Fa’s slumbering face was peaceful, as if her pained expression last night was just a dream.<br/>
Her sleeping face made her look more childish than her actual age, as unguarded as a baby, pure and innocent. But her face was just a few centimeters from my nose, that was too close.<br/>
Ai Fa rested her head on my left shoulder and was sound asleep.<br/>
An indescribable feeling of happiness welled in my heart, yet, I felt confused at the same time.<br/>
Ai Fa’s body leaned to the right as she slept on her side.<br/>
She was asleep while leaning on me.<br/>
When I realized that, my left half of the body sticking close to Ai Fa rapidly heated up.<br/>
My left arm was a bit numb, probably due to poor blood circulation.<br/>
… I had to calm down first.<br/>
My heart was thumping, but I still needed to deal with this situation calmly.<br/>
I searched my memory in a hurry to find out how I fell asleep last night.<br/>
<br/>
Yesterday, Ai Fa suffered a serious injury during her hunt. Her left elbow dislocated.<br/>
She slept until dinner.<br/>
I fed her dinner myself.<br/>
The fever medicine had probably taken effect, so Ai Fa was drowsy the entire time. If I let her eat herself, she would probably drop the utensils onto the floor.<br/>
Besides, we don’t have a dining table in our house, and she couldn’t eat with one hand. I spent half an hour feeding her soup, hamburg steak, and grilled poitan slowly.<br/>
After dinner, Ai Fa leaned against the wall in a daze and didn’t move. Her fever had subsided, and her dislocated elbow didn’t seem to hurt too badly, but she still sat there without moving.<br/>
Lome leaves might have sedative effects. Ai Fa back then wasn’t tense like she usually was, and looked pure, innocent and frail.<br/>
Seeing Ai Fa not acting like herself breaks my heart, but I still had to prepare the food for tomorrow. I started cooking the tarapa sauce and cut 90 portions of kiba meat needed for the "Myam-roasted meat".<br/>
As I did my preparations, Ai Fa was silent and dozed in and out of sleep.<br/>
When I was finished, Ai Fa was in a daze again because of her fever.<br/>
I fed her some fever medicine, but Ai Fa seemed to still be in pain. I kept wiping Ai Fa’s face with a wet piece of cloth, but that would only bring her a moment of relief.<br/>
「Enough… Sit by my side…」<br/>
「Your side?」<br/>
I answered confusedly, and Ai Fa leaned her entire body on my shoulder.<br/>
Her body was very feverish, and her forehead was blazingly hot.<br/>
「This is enough… When my fever subsides, I will recover my strength…」<br/>
Ai Fa’s body shivered a little.<br/>
Her forehead and body were hot, but the fingers on her right hand grabbing my chest were as cold as ice.<br/>
I held her icy fingers tightly, and Ai Fa’s eyes that were moist because of her fever stared at me.<br/>
「… I want to be like this, will it make you unhappy?」<br/>
「Not at all, don’t worry about me for now.」<br/>
Until the candle burned out, I kept staring at Ai Fa’s pained profile.<br/>
The candle burned out, yet, I could see her due to the light of the moon.<br/>
When her face turned peaceful again, I could hear her steady breathing.<br/>
That’s great— I remembered being relieved, and didn’t have any further memories after this.<br/>
Which meant, I fell asleep.<br/>
<br/>
The sunlight shone through the window.<br/>
I observed the brightness in the room and noted that we didn’t oversleep.<br/>
On a closer look, Ai Fa was right next to the wall in our house. We fell asleep leaning against the wall and probably slid down onto the floor. I hoped my body had cushioned her and protected her left arm from any harm.<br/>
I would gladly cushion her fall, but our positions were really awkward right now.<br/>
But I was afraid of aggravating her wounds if I moved, so I had to wake Ai Fa.<br/>
「Ai Fa, it’s morning… Can you get up?」<br/>
「Hmm…」<br/>
Ai Fa grunted angrily.<br/>
Speaking of which, it was rare for me to get up earlier than Ai Fa.<br/>
Furthermore, Ai Fa opened her eyes immediately when I called out to her.<br/>
That was why I felt so flustered. Her childish and pouting face was so cute that it was a crime.<br/>
「Get up first, then sleep later. I can’t move like this.」<br/>
「… You are noisy…」<br/>
Ai Fa complained softly, then rubbed her head against me.<br/>
Sigh, how did things turn out like this? After finally calming down, my brain was in a mess again.<br/>
「I’m the house head… you can’t speak in such an arrogant tone…」<br/>
She was still half-asleep.<br/>
The sight of Ai Fa who was in a daze due to sleepiness was rare, like Darum Wu’s smile.<br/>
But I couldn’t keep admiring her cute face.<br/>
「Dear house head, it’s time for morning chores. I need to clean up dinner from last night, so can you please get up for a while?」<br/>
「Hmmm…」<br/>
Ai Fa made a cute sound again and opened her eyes.<br/>
Her unfocused blue eyes looked at me from a close distance.<br/>
「…Asuta, it’s you…」<br/>
「Yes, it’s your family member Asuta.」<br/>
「…Hmm… It’s Asuta…」<br/>
Ai Fa needlessly repeated herself, then smiled sweetly.<br/>
The prim and proper Ai Fa was actually smiling so sweetly.<br/>
Ai Fa showed a pure and innocent smile unlike her usual smile, then slowly closed her eyes.<br/>
「… So it’s Asuta…」<br/>
「N-No, that’s not it! It’s morning! It’s already morning, house head!」<br/>
She finally opened her eyes wide when she heard me saying that.<br/>
After sighing in relief, Ai Fa’s looked at me quizzingly with her bright eyes.<br/>
「…Asuta, why are you sticking so close to me?」<br/>
「N-No matter how I look at it, aren’t you the one sticking close to me…? Last night, we accidentally leaned on each other and fell asleep.」<br/>
「… I see, I don’t remember.」<br/>
Ai Fa closed her eyes quickly.<br/>
「Thanks to you, my fever is down… Phew…」<br/>
She then let out a cute snore.<br/>
「Don’t sleep anymore! Work! We still have work to do!」<br/>
Seeing that Ai Fa wasn’t in pain anymore, I felt relieved and couldn’t help yelling.<br/>
Ai Fa opened her eyes for the third time and looked at me unhappily.<br/>
「… It’s morning.」<br/>
「Of course. The house is already so bright.」<br/>
「That’s true. Lome leaves disrupted my sleep cycle. I want to rest a bit more.」<br/>
While she was saying that, Ai Fa rubbed her head on my chest again.<br/>
She then ignored the dumbfounded me and sat up suddenly.<br/>
「But I can’t let myself sleep anymore. Asuta, sorry for troubling you.」<br/>
「Not at all… I’m glad that you feel better now.」<br/>
These few minutes were the most difficult of them all. I complained in my heart and got up slowly.<br/>
Ai Fa sat cross-legged on the bed and stretched her right arm.<br/>
「My fever is gone, and my wound doesn’t hurt that much. I can start doing the morning chores now.」<br/>
「Ehh? Go and rest, I will wash the things.」<br/>
「What are you saying? What will you do if the Tsun clan people go there?」<br/>
「They are not that senseless, and won’t attack us so early in the morning! In a way, this is the most prominent time… More importantly, you are hurt now and can’t protect yourself, right?」<br/>
「Hmm? Only my left arm can’t move, you think I will lose to them!」<br/>
Ai Fa pouted unhappily.<br/>
「As long as my right arm can move, I will be fine even if all three Tsun clan brothers were to attack me… In case of the eldest son of the Wu clan I would have to run.」<br/>
The denizens of the Forest’s Edge could determine their opponent’s strength accurately.<br/>
Speaking of which— if Ai Fa didn’t dislocate her left arm, she had the confidence of defeating Jiza Wu?<br/>
What Ludo Wu said flashed across my mind. He said that only Donda Wu could defeat Kamyua Yost.<br/>
「… You can’t wash anything with your hands anyway. If I run into danger, I will sprint home, so you just need to have a good rest.」<br/>
「Hmm… never mind, I don’t want to walk around the village like this. I will leave the chores involving the water source to you.」<br/>
Ai Fa said with a hint of unhappiness on her face.<br/>
「Well then, I will take care of the chores at home then. Be careful, alright?」<br/>
「Okay. But shouldn’t you rest? It will be bad if you get a fever again.」<br/>
「I already said that I’m fine. My bones don’t hurt anymore, and my limbs are filled with strength. I need to move my body as usual to heal myself faster.」<br/>
She looked at me solemnly.<br/>
「Besides, I can feel that last night’s dinner has become a part of my flesh and blood. Compared to my injury last year, my fever subsided faster this time. It’s all thanks to you, Asuta.」<br/>
「… I’m glad to hear that.」<br/>
I finally started smiling.<br/>
Ai Fa’s eyes were smiling too.<br/>
「Asuta, let’s get to work.」<br/>
<br/>
Naturally, I wasn’t assaulted by the Tsun clan during my trip to the water source.<br/>
Unless under the infuence of alcohol, the Tsun clan didn’t dare to make any trouble in public. So there was no need to be so tense in the morning.<br/>
However, I did run into Mida Tsun and Tay Tsun in the Post Station Town last time.<br/>
They probably wouldn’t create havoc by acting drunk.<br/>
But they had a creepy air about them, which made it hard to predict how they would act.<br/>
Even if the head of the Tsun clan ordered them to not stir up trouble, was Mida Tsun smart enough to understand his clan head’s orders? Tay Tsun, on the other hand, was hard to understand. Hence, we could only be on guard for 24 hours a day.<br/>
「Hmm? Why are you dressed like that?」<br/>
When I returned home after cleaning the utensils , Ai Fa had already changed into her hunting attire.<br/>
She didn’t just wear her cape, she was fully armed with the sabre on her waist.<br/>
「Do you even need to ask? I already finished the house chores and am going to forage for firewood and pico leaves.」<br/>
「No, your injury is recent, so you should rest for today. Going into the forest while you are injured will be too hard on you.」<br/>
I placed the pot I just washed onto the stove, scooped two ladles of water into the pot and started burning wood. Before heading into the edge of the woods, I had to cook the poitan.<br/>
I then hung the freshly washed clothes on the wall. My only t-shirt and the white towel were all worn out.<br/>
Ai Fa stood majestically in the center of the room, her eyes tracking me as I walked around the house. She said unhappily:<br/>
「Don’t worry about my injury. Resting will just increase the load for tomorrow’s work. Anyway, after we started running a business in the Post Station Town, the pico leaves are spoiling even faster, right?」<br/>
Of course, I noticed that.<br/>
Pico leaves were a type of spice and could absorb the moisture within the meat and had the effect of a preservative. I buried the meat patty and meat slices into pico leaves one day earlier, and the larger surface area of the processed meat resulted in the pico leaves absorbing even more moisture.<br/>
「We might need to change all the pico leaves in less than a month. In that case, we need to forage as much pico leaves as we can.」<br/>
「Hmm〜 That’s true…」<br/>
「And I sweated a lot yesterday. I want to bath, it feels really uncomfortable.」<br/>
Ai Fa said while scowling her nose.<br/>
「The cape will conceal my injured arm, so don’t worry.」<br/>
Even if she said that, I still felt troubled. When she saw my face, Ai Fa’s expression changed.<br/>
「Asuta, I know you are worried. But you don’t really need to be concerned. I’m just following what my body is telling me… You have to trust my judgment.」<br/>
「… I know.」<br/>
Ai Fa’s gaze was strong and unwavering, filled with strength and reliability.<br/>
Ai Fa was proud of herself as a hunter and wouldn’t be stubborn and push herself, which would delay her recovery.<br/>
I had to believe in her.<br/>
After drying the poitan for the stall and for dinner, we picked up the sack to hold firewood and pico leaves and headed for the edge of the woods.<br/>
It was the usual morning scene.<br/>
However, Ai Fa adjusted the opening of the cape slightly to conceal the left half of her body. She tied her blonde hair loosely to the side. Ai Fa usually bundled her hair above her neck into a complicated pattern, but her hairstyle today was not much different from Vena Wu.<br/>
「Ai Fa, your hairstyle is really refreshing today. It’s hard to tie your hair into your usual complicated pattern with just one hand, right?」<br/>
「Yes, that is tough.」<br/>
「It’s nice to change your hairdo every now and then; it suits you.」<br/>
Anything looked good on a beautiful girl. I added in my heart.<br/>
Ai Fa snorted disinterestedly as we walked along the dirt path.<br/>
「Long hair is a hassle, I always wanted to cut it. I really hope that denizens of Forest’s Edge will abolish the rule about hair.」<br/>
According to the rules of Forest’s Edge, women can’t cut their hair before marriage.<br/>
In the future, will Ai Fa’s beautiful long hair be trimmed short?<br/>
We reached the Lante river as we chatted.<br/>
This was a slow-flowing river at the edge of the woods. The river bank was covered in rocks; the greenery was dense upstream, and loads of pico leaves could be found there.<br/>
Going by our usual habits, the members of the Fa house were supposed to bath in the stream before picking the pico leaves.<br/>
「Will you really be fine? Don’t get washed away by the water, okay?」<br/>
「Shut up.」<br/>
With those words, Ai Fa handed me her necklace and cape for safekeeping.<br/>
As I held the cape, Ai Fa took out a cloth for wiping her body from inside the cape and a change of clothes that had swirly patterns.<br/>
「Oh right, you didn’t go to the water source today.」<br/>
Ai Fa usually changed her clothes early in the morning and washed them at the water source.<br/>
「Can you do your laundry with one hand…? Never mind, you can’t let me help either.」<br/>
「… If you already know, then don’t say it out loud.」<br/>
After glaring at me with squinted eyes, Ai Fa went around to the cover of the boulder. This was the usual scene too.<br/>
I had lived in Ai Fa’s abode for almost 40 days. During my first morning in the Fa house we were attacked by a madarama snake and a kiba consecutively.<br/>
After that, we didn’t encounter such a crisis again. Even now, I still prayed that god wouldn’t let us meet with such a disaster in the morning when Ai Fa was injured.<br/>
While I was leaning against the boulder and keeping an eye on the woods, Ai Fa called out to me from the stream.<br/>
「What is it?」<br/>
「… You have lived in the Fa house for over a month now.」<br/>
So Ai Fa was thinking about the same thing. This made me a little happy.<br/>
「That’s right, 40 days passed in a blink of an eye— but I also think that a lot happened in these 40 days.」<br/>
「Yes… Today is the second day of the blue month.」<br/>
It was rare for Ai Fa to mention the date.<br/>
In order to grasp the migration cycle of the kiba, Ai Fa knew the dates very well. However, everyday life wouldn’t be an inconvenience even if one didn’t know the calendar, so I was clueless about it.<br/>
「Is that so. Then Kamyua will be heading to the eastern kingdom in another 13 days… And are there any events in the blue month?」<br/>
「No, nothing important.」<br/>
「Is your birthday coming soon?」<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
「My birthday is in the red month.」<br/>
When the hell is the red month?<br/>
At this moment, I realized I even lost my birthday.<br/>
If I was to count backward, I could calculate when my next birthday would be. But in this world, the solar calendar was not of much use. According to the calendar in this world, there was an additional 13th month every third year. So there wasn’t much meaning in calculating my birthday.<br/>
No matter what, in my original world, I was just a second-year high schooler that was just 17. It had only been half a month since my birthday when I ran into that disaster.<br/>
In that case, could I treat the day I appeared in this world as my second birthday?<br/>
Will I still be here in a year or two?<br/>
Or will I be pulled back into the scene of the fire, and let fate run its original course?<br/>
Or maybe I will be transported to another world— no, please, just no.<br/>
If that happened, I would lose everything I had. I was weak mentally, and wouldn’t be able to bear such an experience.<br/>
While I was lost in these thoughts, Ai Fa called me again:<br/>
「Asuta, come over here.」<br/>
「Ehh? Are you done bathing?」<br/>
「Yes.」<br/>
「Are you clothed?」<br/>
「… Just what are you thinking?」<br/>
There was anger simmering in Ai Fa’s voice. I quickly moved behind the boulder.<br/>
Ai Fa sat there cross-legged and glared at me with a slightly ferocious face.<br/>
And of course, she was already wearing her clothes, and even her left arm had been bandaged. Her head was tilted slightly to the right, and her long wet hair flowed to the ground.<br/>
「It’s hard for me to dry my hair with one hand.」<br/>
Ai Fa handed me a cloth angrily.<br/>
「I see.」<br/>
I knelt on one knee in the rocky ground and tried to carry out my mistress’ request. If performing such a trivial task could help Ai Fa, I was glad to do so.<br/>
「… Long hair is such a bother.」<br/>
Ai Fa complained as she scowled her mouth.<br/>
「Don’t say that, you have really nice long hair.」<br/>
「Hmmp, my hair reflects the light and gets in the way of my hunt. If I had black hair like my father Gill—」<br/>
Ai Fa stopped a little unnaturally.<br/>
「What’s the matter?」<br/>
When I asked that, she lowered her eyelids and said:「It’s nothing.」<br/>
「I suddenly remembered that a long time ago, I also mentioned this to Grandma Jiba and Rimee Wu.」<br/>
「I see.」<br/>
Speaking of which, I felt that I had grown apart from Grandma Jiba and Rimee Wu. Our lives were getting on track now, but I still missed the time we spent in the Wu village.<br/>
「…Oh right. Ai Fa, you can’t hunt like this, right?」<br/>
「Of course. I need to recuperate between ten days to half a month.」<br/>
「During this time, do you want to stay in the Wu clan village during the day?」I suggested while drying her hair.<br/>
Ai Fa looked up at me in surprise.<br/>
「But why? I have no reason to do that.」<br/>
「You can only rest if you stay at home, right…? Besides, we need to be wary of the Tsun clan.」<br/>
「The Tsun clan don’t know that I’m hurt.」<br/>
「Even if they don’t know, they might still come and pick on us?」<br/>
「If that happens, they will suffer my fury. I can’t hold back now, so those Tsun clan retards will be in danger instead.」<br/>
「But…」<br/>
「Asuta, we are not the kins of the Wu clan, we shouldn’t rely on them.」<br/>
Ai Fa’s stern eyes looked straight at me through her wet fringe.<br/>
「We are merely paying an adequate amount of copper plates in exchange for the help of the Wu clan’s women. We don’t have any special relationship with the Wu clan.」<br/>
「But Rimee Wu and Grandma Jiba are both special to you. I think this is a good chance for you to chat with them.」<br/>
Ai Fa’s eyes turned gentle.<br/>
She poked my chest gently.<br/>
「Thanks to you, I renewed my bonds with Rimee Wu and Grandma Jiba. I have no other wish other than that… even without any dialogue, my heart is still bonded tightly with them.」<br/>
「Yes.」<br/>
「Leaving my relationship with them aside for now, I don’t think I should rely on the Wu clan. I have turned down their marriage proposal before. Besides, when a member of the Wu clan suggested that you should join another house, I also rejected them.」<br/>
I see. I kept quiet.<br/>
But even so, I still thought the Fa house should work hard on building a normal relationship with the Wu clan. However, Leina Wu thought that it was dangerous for me to stay in the Fa house. If we were to go to the Wu clan because of Ai Fa’s injury, it would be a slap in her face.<br/>
「I understand. Let’s ignore what I just said, I didn’t think it through properly.」<br/>
「Your thinking is always too shallow.」<br/>
「…Hey.」<br/>
「You never think things through, right?」<br/>
「Hey! The truth hurts, you know?」<br/>
「I’m just kidding, don’t be mad.」<br/>
Ai Fa said nonchalantly.<br/>
She poked my chest gently again.<br/>
「You are always saying things I don’t understand, but I don’t always feel unhappy about it. If it makes me uncomfortable, I will just beat you up. So don’t hold back and say whatever you want in the future.」<br/>
「… I don’t want to get beaten up, so I will talk less.」<br/>
I answered without much thought, and Ai Fa answered sternly:<br/>
「You can’t, you have to tell me how you feel and what you are thinking, don’t hide anything.」<br/>
「… Will you also do the same?」<br/>
When she heard my answer, Ai Fa pouted a little and replied:「… I’m doing my best.」<br/>
I felt a fluttering in my chest, and I patted Ai Fa’s head.<br/>
「Alright, your hair is almost dry.」<br/>
「Yes.」<br/>
Ai Fa nimbly manipulated a string with her mouth and right hand and tied up her long hair again.<br/>
「… Right now, the most troubling person isn’t the eldest, nor the second son of the Tsun clan, but the youngest. In that case, your situation is more precarious than mine.」<br/>
「That’s right. I’m very cautious every day.」<br/>
「Eh?」<br/>
「Since I can only rest and recover, it makes no difference whether I’m home or in the city, right? If we can see each other, we will both be more at ease.」<br/>
Ai Fa stared at me closely.<br/>
「I won’t get the way of your work, and I can help carry some luggage too. If I feel sleepy, I can rest adequately… It won’t inconvenience you, right?」<br/>
「Not at all. I will feel more at ease if you are with me.」<br/>
I said sincerely.<br/>
The Post Station Town wasn’t safe, but compared to leaving Ai Fa home alone, I would be able to rest easier if she was with me<br/>
We never imagined that this day would not end normally.<br/>
Our business in the Post Station Town was going smoothly, and we had no idea that starting from today we will have to stay in the Wu clan village.<br/>
Staying in the Wu clan had nothing to do with Ai Fa’s injuries. While we were operating our stall in the Post Station Town, the appearance of a certain person threw our plans awry.<br/>
A member of the Tsun clan we had never seen before was finally targeting Ai Fa and me.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
