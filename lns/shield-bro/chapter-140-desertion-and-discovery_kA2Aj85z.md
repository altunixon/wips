Desertion and Discovery <br/>
 <br/>
 <br/>
Everyone's appetite had been sated, the slave merchant had also returned and night had descended. <br/>
 <br/>
“Hey? Are you really going to do it?” (anon slave 1) <br/>
“I-isn't it obvious” (anon slave 2) <br/>
“But....everyone was nice and the food was great?” (anon slave 1) <br/>
“No, those guys are definitely trying to deceive us!” (anon slave 2) <br/>
 <br/>
It was noisy outside.  <br/>
It was dark and hard to see but, for some reason, the new slaves were running towards the fields. <br/>
 <br/>
“Haa....Haa” (anon slave) <br/>
 <br/>
There was a somewhat strained atmosphere. <br/>
Just what were they planning? <br/>
*Rustling* They tried to push their way through the Bioplant's field. <br/>
............ <br/>
 <br/>
“ “Waaaaaaahhhh!?” “ (runaway slaves) <br/>
 <br/>
Ah, they got caught in the defences I established. <br/>
Hearing the scream, the other slaves left the house and headed towards the fields to examine the situation.  <br/>
*Sigh*.....For the time being, I have to go out and have a look. <br/>
 <br/>
“Shield-niichan. We heard a scream” (kiel) <br/>
 <br/>
When I exit the house, a concerned-looking Kiel rushes over to me. <br/>
It seems like Raphtalia went ahead to look at the situation. <br/>
 <br/>
“It's alright. There won't be any deaths. I've already prepared for the worst case scenario and only implemented some defensive measures” (naofumi) <br/>
“Worst case scenario?” (kiel) <br/>
“I could bind them with the slave crest but then there's the problem of being unable to give detailed orders. Well in short, I'm talking about desertion” (naofumi) <br/>
 <br/>
Yes, the slave crest has the possibility of prohibiting desertion itself. <br/>
Once they leave the grounds, inducing death was even possible but, as one would expect, I paid no small amount for these guys so killing them would be bad. <br/>
Besides, I have plans to designate slaves to peddle outside the village. That's why I configured the penalties to only cause chest pains for all the slaves staying in the village at night. <br/>
 <br/>
“ “Waahhhh! He-helpー!” ” (runaway slaves) <br/>
  <br/>
The monsters I used to maintain the soil, Dunes, had emerged from underground, coiled around the three slaves who tried to escape and hung them up in mid-air. <br/>
I had given instructions to the Dunes so that anyone fleeing from the established site would be apprehended. <br/>
 <br/>
“To abscond so suddenly, aren't these guys courageous." (naofumi) <br/>
“Naofumi-sama!” (raphtalia) <br/>
 <br/>
After discovering the circumstances, Raphtalia joined us with an urgent-looking expression. <br/>
I thought this commotion of escaping would happen sometime, but it was later than I had expected. <br/>
That was because Raphtalia's old friends became attached to me for some reason or another. <br/>
Moreover, many of them had lived here to begin with. <br/>
 <br/>
“Now then you guys, where were you planning to go after you escaped?” (naofumi) <br/>
 <br/>
I faced the slaves who were hanging in mid-air and inquired. <br/>
 <br/>
“Wh-Who's going to say anything!” (anon slave 2) <br/>
 <br/>
The boy who was acting as the leader, replied. <br/>
Hm.... he definitely has a lot of spirit. <br/>
It would be a great contest between Kiel and him. <br/>
 <br/>
“Is that so, if you don't talk then I’ll let that fellow play around, but is that alright with you?” (naofumi) <br/>
“Gr...” (anon slave 2 – runaway slave leader) <br/>
 <br/>
By the way, Dunes also have their own personality, their appearance may be of a huge earthworm but they're quite amiable and love to play. <br/>
If it's this kind of rebellious kid then I should let them play all night. <br/>
To be honest, I don't have any obligation to raise a slave who just attempts to run away. I'd like to sell them back to the slave merchant immediately but I will give them a chance. <br/>
 <br/>
“Look, just talk” (naofumi) <br/>
“Wh-Who's going to say anything!” (runaway slave leader) <br/>
“If that's the case, I'll turn you into bait for my followers?” (naofumi) <br/>
 <br/>
I looked at the situation and gestured indirectly to Firo. The slaves distanced themselves from Firo. <br/>
 <br/>
“Eh? Firo-chan also eats people?” (kiel) <br/>
“She does have quite an appetite” (naofumi) <br/>
“If you defy Shield-niichan you'll be bait? Seriously?” (kiel) <br/>
 <br/>
The slaves gathered together and whispered. <br/>
She was just standing around in her human form but, read the mood and turn into your monster form―― . <br/>
 <br/>
“No~!” (firo) <br/>
 <br/>
That Firo, she denied it! <br/>
Did she learn some culture when she came here? No way...such unnecessary knowledge. <br/>
Raphtalia whispered to the slaves quietly. <br/>
 <br/>
“Naofumi-sama is......saying that kind of thing but.....” (raphtalia) <br/>
“So really?” (anon slave) <br/>
“Shield-niichan is somewhat naive” (kiel) <br/>
“I can hear you. You brats!” (naofumi) <br/>
 <br/>
Jeez, now I can't use dignity or bullshit. <br/>
 <br/>
“......” (runaway slave leader) <br/>
 <br/>
The leader of the captured slaves also had a doubtful face. <br/>
You should read the atmosphere. <br/>
 <br/>
“But the thing about becoming monster bait is real?  If I order you to, then it won't mean that no one will become bait.” (naofumi) <br/>
 <br/>
Become a Caterpiland, become a Dune, if I say be bait then you might get eaten. <br/>
When I turned my attention to the monster hut, the Caterpilands were sleeping soundly. <br/>
Will they turn into butterflies? <br/>
I cast aside these needless thoughts. <br/>
The Dunes played with the slave children. <br/>
They're huge so they're great for using as threats. If this were an 18+ game, the caterpillars and worms would be used for sexual assault. <br/>
 <br/>
“Now talk” (naofumi) <br/>
“Eep!” (slave leader) <br/>
“Look, if you don't talk then the Dunes might get hungry and eat you~” (naofumi) <br/>
 <br/>
The slaves who originated from this village arbitrarily gave the Dunes names and, “They won't eat him right?” was whispered around. <br/>
 <br/>
I want to say that they only eat dirt but now's not the time for that. <br/>
 <br/>
“At the worst, another Philorial will eat you guys” (naofumi) <br/>
“Eat us!?” (slave leader) <br/>
 <br/>
I could feel a gaze from the hut. <br/>
I shook my head with a *swish*. <br/>
Everyone was raised naively! <br/>
 <br/>
“Look, they're waiting impatiently!” (naofumi) <br/>
“Eat! Eat!” (slaves) <br/>
 <br/>
The chant changed the mood, but for those who didn't know what life in the village was like, it would appear to be excitement. <br/>
It would have been great if I could have used this from the beginning. <br/>
 <br/>
“What's your answer?” (naofumi) <br/>
“......Fine. But you have to spare the others!” (slave leader) <br/>
 <br/>
The runaway slaves' leader reluctantly revealed their story. <br/>
It seems to just be gossip among the slaves but in Melromarc's harbour and other various places there exists a faction that's stipulating the release of slaves. <br/>
In that faction, a plausible rumour is being spread around saying that Demi-humans can have their slave crest unconditionally removed and will be set free in foreign countries. <br/>
 <br/>
Are these Silt Welt's people? <br/>
No, for argument's sake, even if they resembled Silt Welt or Schild Frieden's people, It seems that recognition of the same species is strong. <br/>
If I had a slogan that said that I would unconditionally free them in another country, I would have some sort of scheme to help me make a profit. <br/>
 <br/>
Someone who would do that with good intentions doesn't exist. <br/>
If we could use a boat, it would be convenient as transportation. <br/>
To become the working force or a foreign county from a safe place, or something like that. <br/>
That would be a crueller treatment than just being a slaves....it's felonious. <br/>
Or it could possibly be that slave merchants circulate it to recycle business. <br/>
 <br/>
At the least, I saw that these guys just couldn't wait for their desired ending. <br/>
However, it's a dependable technique for business. Using a smile to deceive the slaves who turn up. <br/>
 <br/>
Come to think of it, the slave merchant said so before he left. <br/>
No matter what, orphans have increased due to the Spirit Turtle's influence. <br/>
There are people who become slaves prior to ending up as orphans, and it seems there are few human slaves but I heard they make humans into slaves in other countries.  <br/>
It seems like the slave merchant is busy thanks to that sequence of events. He did leave pretty quickly after consuming the food I made. <br/>
 <br/>
“Did you guys know?” (naofumi) <br/>
“Now that you mention it, I'm starting to remember” (anon slave) <br/>
“Yeah, there was that kind of story” (anon slave) <br/>
 <br/>
If you knew about it then tell me earlier.......Jeez. <br/>
 <br/>
“Shield-niichan's place is just so comfortable that we totally forgot about it” (kiel) <br/>
“Yeah!” (anon slave) <br/>
 <br/>
It was a good inclination but~....... somehow I feel like I’m being underrated. <br/>
 <br/>
“Next time you'd better tell me these things” (naofumi) <br/>
“Oka~y!” (slaves) <br/>
 <br/>
Because I have no idea where this money-making story comes from. <br/>
Until now, we've just been revising our actions after things happen but if we can read ahead of time, then we can not only keep damages to a minimum but it would even be possible to forestall them. <br/>
Knowledge is power. <br/>
 <br/>
“Now then, desertion is a serious crime. However, I'm not a demon. You guys have only just come here so I'll postpone it for a short while. Think about it carefully” (naofumi) <br/>
 <br/>
I instructed the Dunes to release the slaves, who were then taken in by Raphtalia and the others. <br/>
 <br/>
“Educate them properly. That's all” (naofumi) <br/>
 <br/>
The runaway slaves defiantly glared at me with hostility. <br/>
If it doesn't seem like they've reflected, I'll sell them when the slave merchant comes again. <br/>
I can recover my money back if I raise their levels and if they become stronger than usual with the shield's correction skill, he'll probably buy them happily. <br/>
.......Let's hope that they can get along with Raphtalia and the others until then. <br/>
 <br/>
“It's alright, this won't be like the other places where all you do is suffer pain, that's why we'd like you to help with our....village” (raphtalia) <br/>
“........” (runaway slave) <br/>
 <br/>
The three slaves murmured to Raphtalia and the other slaves and averted their faces uncomfortably. <br/>
 <br/>
“It has been very painful for you, hasn't it. However......a little bit, with just a short time it'll be fine so I'd like you to compare him with your previous masters” (raphtalia) <br/>
“........” (runaway slave) <br/>
“You know, that person is the Hero of the Shield-sama” (raphtalia) <br/>
“Eh!?” (runaway slave) <br/>
“You've heard the rumours, right? He's the one who saved this country and even become a legend in the country of the Demi-humans” (raphtalia) <br/>
“Y-yeah. I heard about it. Some day...... that he's the saint-sama who will save us Demi-human slaves” (runaway slave) <br/>
“Yes, and you know, that person may have a bad mouth but he has been rebuilding the village to save us slaves, and we'd like you to become a part of that power” (raphtalia) <br/>
“But.......” (runaway slave) <br/>
“It's okay if you still don't believe it yet. Little by little, we'll show you proof that it's not a lie” (raphtalia) <br/>
 <br/>
Well, for the time being I'll leave it to Raphtalia and the others. <br/>
I returned to my room and resumed my compounding studies. <br/>
I've become able to do a considerable amount of the difficult compounding. If I have all the ingredients I shouldn't fail. <br/>
I have the materials prepared by the queen so let's give it a try. <br/>
 <br/>
 <br/>
The next day. <br/>
 <br/>
“Is Iwatani-dono here!” (knight) <br/>
 <br/>
The female knight came intruding early in the morning. <br/>
 <br/>
“What's up? Did the Spirit Turtle appear again?” (naofumi) <br/>
“Can you even handle that much excitement!” (knight) <br/>
 <br/>
I'm still in the middle of recuperating. This time I’ll have to rely on the Seven Star Heroes. <br/>
Well.......whatever happens, I also want to be able to participate in it. <br/>
 <br/>
“And? You seem to have some urgent business” (naofumi) <br/>
“I have a message from the queen. I was told to convey it immediately” (knight) <br/>
“The contents?” (naofumi) <br/>
“It seems we've discovered a companion of the Hero of the Spear” (knight) <br/>
 <br/>
What? Discovered a companion of Motoyasu? <br/>
From her words, it doesn't appear to be Bitch. <br/>
So it comes to either Woman 1 or Woman 2. <br/>
From this expression you can't tell who is who. <br/>
Well that's because I don't know their names. <br/>
 <br/>
“A corpse?” (naofumi) <br/>
“Wrong. Everything seems to be that an aristocratic father was worried about his daughter but she's fed up because she was forced to help with her mother's housework.” (knight) <br/>
 <br/>
......It's a story I’ve heard before. <br/>
It's about her. So now I'm supposed to use her to slay Motoyasu, huh. <br/>
And in the end, she returned home and helped with work. <br/>
Her assistance didn't seem very proactive, but that sounds like her. She would have felt it was troublesome. <br/>
 <br/>
“Don't you have to guard her?” (naofumi) <br/>
“It seems we've listened to her circumstances. And so. We'd like Iwatani-dono to meet with that companion and ensnare the Hero of the Spear” (knight) <br/>
 <br/>
I see......there's the possibility of her attempting to rejoin Motoyasu. <br/>
We'll be gambling on whether it'll go well or not, but it would be good if we could catch Motoyasu. <br/>
 <br/>
“Will Motoyasu's companion cooperate with that plan? She might double-cross us and pass information back to Motoyasu” (naofumi) <br/>
“We've already assigned a Shadow for surveillance. We've also received a report that she currently wants to cooperate” (knight) <br/>
“Hmm.......” (naofumi) <br/>
 <br/>
Well, if my assumption is correct, she could discern right from wrong when she cut ties. <br/>
And now she was trying to protect her own position by plea bargaining. <br/>
 <br/>
“Understood. Where should I be heading?” (naofumi) <br/>
“Ah, I'll give you the map” (knight) <br/>
 <br/>
I received the map from the female knight and took Raphtalia and Firo with me to prepare for our departure. <br/>
 <br/>
“You guys, please help the newbies level up” (naofumi) <br/>
“Yeah. Understood.” (kiel) <br/>
“I understand” (rishia) <br/>
 <br/>
Rishia stood in the front and nodded. <br/>
 <br/>
“Sorry, Rishia. If there's information about Itsuki then inviting you will take precedence” <br/>
“Yes. I'll be waiting” (rishia) <br/>
 <br/>
Recently, Rishia's level had risen up to 35. <br/>
It's almost time for a Class Up. <br/>
As that may be, I want her to Class Up together with the others so it'll be a bit later but....for now, the capture of Motoyasu has the highest priority.
