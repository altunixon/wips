Shieldbro is kind of an ass to Firo...... <br/>
 <br/>
Chapter 58 <br/>
Wanted. <br/>
 <br/>
"Umuu......" <br/>
 <br/>
I am observing the situation behind a bush. <br/>
Its been several hours since we picked up the second princess. Since there is a village nearby we must be cautious. <br/>
Nearby is the village that was plagued by the dragon corpse a while ago. <br/>
It seems what the knight said was true. <br/>
 <br/>
"Devil of the shield Iwatani Naofumi slaughtered imperial guard knights and kidnapped the second princess while escaping. Wanted dead or alive. The prize-" <br/>
 <br/>
On the notice board within the village, there piece of paper that has quite a large amount of price money declared on it by the soldiers of the castle. <br/>
Is this seriously only a few hours after? They seemed too prepared for this. <br/>
I knew this was a set up since the beginning. <br/>
For some reason they also assumed I killed off those knights that I caught. <br/>
 <br/>
I heard it. <br/>
If you strap a bomb on yourself and charge you will go to heaven. <br/>
These guys are putting similar insane thoughts to practice. <br/>
 <br/>
"The Imperial guardsmen knights have memorized an image of the criminal! The Imperial guardsmen knight who brought the crystal ball to the castle also died after duty was completed." <br/>
 <br/>
Furthermore. It seems that a hologram of me is being projected by the crystal ball. <br/>
My face was twisted with wickedness and,I am strangling the second princess by her neck, which also appears to be bleeding.  <br/>
......Is that amount of fabrication even possible? <br/>
Should I make a habit of avoiding crystal balls at all costs in the future? <br/>
Though she looks pretty healthy despite being on the verge of death...... <br/>
 <br/>
When I look closely at the second princess's face, despite the fact that she is being strangled, her expression is more shocked than painful. <br/>
By the way, the country of Silt Welt is located south east of Shirudo Furiden which is north east of our current location. <br/>
It seems that it's for us necessary to cross two countries. <br/>
That is considerably further than before. <br/>
We will somehow have to advance without being found. <br/>
 <br/>
"If you see the devil that has a strange bird pulling his carriage. Contact the Country immediately." <br/>
 <br/>
The crystal ball then shows Firo's image, and her expression is that of a bird of prey spitting poison from the mouth. <br/>
That's good. I can use poison since they put that in the forgery. <br/>
This is going to be a problem though, since Firo is our main means of transportation. <br/>
 <br/>
We might have to leave Firo somewhere. <br/>
 <br/>
"So, Firo you understand right?" <br/>
"Noo~!" <br/>
 <br/>
As I finished scouting the village, I went to Firo and to let her know. <br/>
If we continue letting Firo pull the carriage to refuge she will attract a lot of attention. <br/>
If it comes down to it Firo could just abandon the carriage and run off with her superior speed. <br/>
They would have a hard time catching her but we would lose everything. <br/>
So, I have to explain the situation. <br/>
 <br/>
"We can't help it. Because you stand out." <br/>
 <br/>
In the sense that she's an unusual demon. <br/>
She is the reason I am known as the saint of the holy bird after all. <br/>
 <br/>
"Can't Firo just change into a different form before anything happens? Firo will work hard!" <br/>
"How are you-" <br/>
 <br/>
Firo's body shines and starts transforming. <br/>
She will probably pull the carriage in her human form anyway. <br/>
Her neck and feet started extending. <br/>
 <br/>
"Gueeee!" <br/>
 <br/>
Firo has transformed into a normal Philo Rial that resembles an ostrich. <br/>
Well, the size is considerably bigger than average I guess. <br/>
 <br/>
"Can you maintain this figure?" <br/>
"Gueee!" <br/>
 <br/>
She nods. <br/>
 <br/>
"Can you only chirp in that form?" <br/>
"Guee!" <br/>
"I see." <br/>
 <br/>
I guess we will be fine if she can keep this appearance. <br/>
 <br/>
"Firo-chan is amazing!" <br/>
 <br/>
The second princess's eyes sparkles as she begins playing with Firo. <br/>
 <br/>
"Gueeee" <br/>
 <br/>
This high pitched screeching is better than her toxic mouth anyway. <br/>
 <br/>
"When you're in that form be quiet." <br/>
"Guee!" <br/>
 <br/>
My head was gripped by her foot. <br/>
Naturally since Raphtalia and Firo rarely attack me they forget that it violates the slave mark. <br/>
The demon crest appears on her chest and she rolls over in pain. <br/>
 <br/>
"Gueee!?" <br/>
"Firo-chan!?" <br/>
"Seriously, what is it you don't like?" <br/>
"Don't use violence on Firo-chan!" <br/>
"I didn't. The demon crest only activated because she attacked me." <br/>
 <br/>
Though she is still sort of cute in this form, although her communication is lacking. <br/>
But like this I don't know what Firo is saying. <br/>
It seems that this could be from my inner thoughts of "it would be nice if I had a pet that will unconditionally listen to me and not be noisy." <br/>
Firo returns to her human forms and starts whining like a child. <br/>
 <br/>
"It's painful!" <br/>
"You asked for it. Even you understand. Demons can't attack their masters." <br/>
"Ueh......" <br/>
 <br/>
The second princess is strangely worried about Firo. <br/>
Is it because they are friends? <br/>
 <br/>
"For the time being, I'm assuming you are fine with disguising ourselves." <br/>
 <br/>
Up until now we were fine staying hidden as a saint, so it should work out somehow. <br/>
 <br/>
"Raphtalia...... can you make yourself look a little shabby, and wear a hat?" <br/>
 <br/>
So like this, the princess and I hid ourselves within the carriage while the transformed Firo and disguised Raphtalia took care of passing the village. <br/>
 <br/>
"Ah......" <br/>
 <br/>
Raphtalia meets the villager's eyes. <br/>
 <br/>
"......" <br/>
"......" <br/>
 <br/>
We pass silently. <br/>
 <br/>
"......" <br/>
"......" <br/>
 <br/>
The metal carriage passes the village as the soldiers watch. <br/>
 <br/>
"Wait." <br/>
 <br/>
We were halted. <br/>
I begin preparing for being found out, we should be able to deal with the people in this village. <br/>
 <br/>
"O-okay. What's wrong?" <br/>
"The other side of your carriage has a wing mark. It resembles the one on that devil bird......" <br/>
"N-no. I'm just a merchant. <br/>
"Hou......May I confirm what is inside?" <br/>
 <br/>
This is dangerous. <br/>
The soldier puts hand on the door of the carriage. <br/>
What to do. I may be fine since I am wearing common clothing and my shield is in the form of a book, but the princess will be recognized immediately. <br/>
 <br/>
"Ah!" <br/>
 <br/>
The villager who made eye contact with Raphtalia suddenly spoke. <br/>
 <br/>
"What's wrong!?" <br/>
 <br/>
The soldier turns around to face the villager. <br/>
 <br/>
"I heard that someone spotted the demon of the shield a while ago over there." <br/>
"Really!?" <br/>
 <br/>
The villager nods his head. <br/>
The soldier starts running towards the direction indicated by the villager. <br/>
 <br/>
"Over here." <br/>
 <br/>
The villager knocks on the carriage. <br/>
 <br/>
"Hurry, before it's too late." <br/>
 <br/>
It seems he's going to provide a hiding place for us. <br/>
What to do...... the deceived soldier will come back soon and that will be disastrous. <br/>
 <br/>
"Please go. I'll stall them here." <br/>
 <br/>
Raphtalia senses my hesitation and decides for me. <br/>
 <br/>
"But-" <br/>
"I planned to do this since the beginning." <br/>
 <br/>
Is that so? <br/>
The second princess and I get off the carriage when we arrive at the house, I cover her with a mantle as the villager guides us. <br/>
 <br/>
"There is nothing." <br/>
"Huh? Was I wrong?" <br/>
"No, you reported as ordered and even gave details, he just got away." <br/>
"I see" <br/>
 <br/>
The villager finishes deceiving the solder and he checks the carriage. <br/>
 <br/>
"Hmmm......there are only miscellaneous goods. Is this medicine?" <br/>
"Yeah, an adventurer asked me to transport it. hahaha" <br/>
 <br/>
While in disguise Raphtalia answers with a wry smile. <br/>
 <br/>
"I see, well sorry I bothered you." <br/>
"No it's fine." <br/>
 <br/>
The soldier leaves to patrol somewhere else. <br/>
The villager points Raphtalia in the direction of the inn and she responds obediently. <br/>
 <br/>
"Hmm......" <br/>
 <br/>
We were peeping from the window of the private house. <br/>
I was very nervous. <br/>
That was pretty dangerous. If that villager choose not to help us there would have been an uproar. <br/>
 <br/>
"Saint-sama are you all right?" <br/>
"Ah yea......somehow." <br/>
"After saint-sama saved the village we noticed you were actually the Hero of the shield-sama." <br/>
"And you guys don't condemn me?" <br/>
"Condemn!? No way. The saint saved the people of this village. There is no way we will repay kindness with enmity." <br/>
"......Are we safe?" <br/>
 <br/>
The second princess anxiously asks. <br/>
 <br/>
"You're going to side with the devil?" <br/>
"We received various things from the Three Heroes church. But, the devil of the shield kindly saved us from the disaster that the god of the sword caused." <br/>
 <br/>
The fight here was harsh. I also learned various things from this village. <br/>
It seems that the village is still recovering from after-effects of the plague. <br/>
 <br/>
"Although you might be called a devil,under these circumstances we would be even worse than devils if we do not repay our favour." <br/>
 <br/>
The villager points at the second princess is about to ask. <br/>
 <br/>
"This is just a little conspiracy." <br/>
"Well it's fine if the princess went willingly." <br/>
 <br/>
The princess nods at the villager's words. <br/>
 <br/>
"Currently there are those within the country aiming for my life. The Hero of the Shield-sama saved me......" <br/>
 <br/>
The villager nods in understanding at the princess's answer. <br/>
 <br/>
"I get it. Some of us might be ungrateful though.So you should quickly escape." <br/>
"......I know." <br/>
"There is a cart in the back that is fully loaded with straw. Please hid in it, and several villagers will carry you to your companion who is at the inn." <br/>
"I am grateful." <br/>
 <br/>
Thanks to the villagers who carried the cart of hay and distracted the soldier, we rejoined Raphtalia. <br/>
 <br/>
"As I thought we are in considerable danger in this carriage. Let's ditch it for something else." <br/>
"Gueee!?" <br/>
 <br/>
Transformed Firo informs me of her displeasure. <br/>
Her neck is shaking back and forth. <br/>
 <br/>
"Gue! Gue!" <br/>
"We can't help it! Do you want to be found and caught? The second princess, Mel-chan will be killed." <br/>
"Gu......" <br/>
 <br/>
Firo reluctantly falls silent at the mention of the second princess's life being in danger. <br/>
It seems she has become quite an important friend for her to care this much...... <br/>
 <br/>
"You're great, Firo. You can let go of important things for your friend." <br/>
"Gue?" <br/>
 <br/>
I pat her kindly. <br/>
Even if I don't understand what she is saying, she choose correctly. <br/>
 <br/>
"After this is over we'll certainly take it back." <br/>
"Gue!" <br/>
 <br/>
Absolutely. I understand.  <br/>
 <br/>
"Sorry. Would you mind looking after the carriage here?" <br/>
"......Sure." <br/>
 <br/>
The villager seems to understand the situation and accepts it. <br/>
 <br/>
"I will be very grateful." <br/>
"You've already done enough for us." <br/>
"I see. alright, second princess,come here. Change your clothes, we'll be discovered instantly with what you're wearing now." <br/>
"O.....okay" <br/>
 <br/>
The second princess doesn't seem very happy about the idea of wearing cheap clothing but given the situation she has no choice. <br/>
It seems that the apprentice's clothing from villager barely fits. <br/>
It's probably due to the villager having no children. <br/>
Compared to the second princess's usual clothing, now she looks like a shabby little villager. <br/>
Albeit a well-bred one since blue hair is only asserted with noble born children. <br/>
Well I can worry about that as we travel. There is no reason to discard her old clothes. <br/>
It will be a little awkward to bring it around though. <br/>
 <br/>
"Fill the bags with miscellaneous goods." <br/>
 <br/>
I put the more valuable things inside the straw cart and cover it. <br/>
Anything bulky was given to the villagers. <br/>
We should be fine going for two weeks like this. This stuff will be useful for the revival of the village. <br/>
 <br/>
"Alright, let's go." <br/>
"Okay" <br/>
 <br/>
We leave the village quietly and while the villagers see us off. <br/>
Well, we were still seen by another villager. <br/>
After this, our best bet would be to avoid towns and villages as much as possible. <br/>
The wagon made a rumbling sound as we began to run north east. <br/>
If possible I hope the village won't be punished for helping us.
