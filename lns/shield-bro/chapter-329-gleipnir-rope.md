Kookie was lazy and promoted the first person to volunteer the last time Kookie complained about finding an editor. Please welcome RebelGoRound~~<br/>
I haven’t actually given him a test so I’ll let you readers decide on his fate (but please no being mean >w<)<br/>
P.S. Good luck Yoraikun for his Exams<br/>
ED: Thanks for the shoutout. I hope you all treat me well. Yoroshiku! Ganbatte, Yoraikun!<br/>
Gleipnir Rope<br/>
"Well, I don’t hate that kind of rotten behaviour, but it’ll lessen the entertainment so I’ll stop with the hostages. Be grateful." (Naofumi)<br/>
I feel a little refreshed but I’ll enjoy that later.<br/>
Otherwise it just stinks of villainy.<br/>
"Besides, I also feel like I should get serious soon." (Naofumi)<br/>
As expected, it’s quite useful.<br/>
Although I wasn’t able to use it seriously when Ren and the others were my opponents.<br/>
I invoke the Fenrir Rod’s special ability, Gleipnir Rope.<br/>
Chains manifest from the ground, with Witch as their designated target.<br/>
"Sto―" (Tact)<br/>
I bind up Tact as well, who was still putting on an act.<br/>
It might be that the damage from before hadn’t quite faded, but I was able to bind him easily.<br/>
"Argh… my power.." (Tact)<br/>
"Ah, I don’t think those chains will come apart so easily." (Naofumi)<br/>
The effect duration of Gleipnir Rope depended on the users’ magic.<br/>
In my world, these chains were used to bind the famous god-killing wolf. [T/N: In Norse mythology, Gleipnir is a dwarven-made chain used to bind Fenrir]<br/>
It’d be a disgrace if it was easily torn apart.<br/>
"Ku… how about this!" (Tact)<br/>
Tact deployed the shield he stole from me with a frustrated countenance.<br/>
The shield was, judging from its appearance, the Wrath Shield.<br/>
I suppose he should be angry enough towards me.<br/>
I’ll have to be wary of Blutopfer and Iron Maiden.<br/>
I don’t know if he’ll get any negative effects, but I suppose I’d have the advantage if he does use them?<br/>
No, dominating him with attacks would be safer.<br/>
"Right, I’ll make an allowance then. Take it…. properly. Otherwise it’ll hit the women behind you, you know?" (Naofumi)<br/>
Tact turned towards the women who couldn’t move due to fear, and then glared at me with eyes full of frantic determination to protect them.<br/>
Right right, that’s the expression I wanted to see.<br/>
You – who stole the lives of Atla, the Queen, Granny, the villages, the Allied forces and the other people I have a relationship with – your face stained with hatred.<br/>
"Don’t glare like that. You still haven’t suffered enough." (Naofumi)<br/>
I finished charging and fired my Skill again.<br/>
"Fenrir Force V!" (Naofumi)<br/>
This time I foresaw the recoil, and without putting my spirit into it, I anticipated that he would probably be able to endure it and fired.<br/>
A thick beam fired towards the tied up Tact from the tip of the cane.<br/>
"Gu…." (Tact)<br/>
Oh, that’s only to be expected of the shield stolen from me.<br/>
It seems the women behind Tact haven’t received any damage at all.<br/>
But how was Tact, who had to bear the full brunt of it all?<br/>
"Uguuuu….." (Tact)<br/>
"Ah, I forgot. The legendary cane I’m holding is called Fenrir Rod. Its special ability is something called Rebellion Against God. Its effects are…" (Naofumi)<br/>
This is something that was established when I first obtained the cane and sparred with Ren and the others.<br/>
Fohl had a measure for my attack and didn’t take much damage but Ren and the others were different.<br/>
I was told it hurt more than they anticipated.<br/>
Rebellion Against God’s effect must be that when a Seven Star Weapon attacked a Four Saint Weapon, the power increases.<br/>
Well thinking about it normally, a weapon whose ability rises when against the Four Saints is impossible based on the laws of the world.<br/>
There wasn’t any other weapon with the same skill, and the Spirit of the Cane might have lent the power to fight against the stolen shield.<br/>
In other words, I felt it was like a special, only for now kind of thing.<br/>
In reality, the Fenrir rod was a item.<br/>
"You probably used the shield because you anticipated its high defense but the damage you incur will rise with that shield, you know?" (Naofumi)<br/>
Of course, the shield itself has a high defense so there would be no problem if it was me.<br/>
The beam shot for 5 seconds and stopped.<br/>
There, emitting smoke throughout his body, was a worn-out Tact who was out of breath and barely managed to stand.<br/>
It seems Tact incurred a befitting amount of damage for taking Fenrir Force’s beam.<br/>
"Gu….u…" (Tact)<br/>
"Oi, oi. Don’t collapse yet. I’m still not satisfied yet, and we’ve got to continue playing until Fohl comes." (Naofumi)<br/>
It kind of feels like bullying.<br/>
But I feel like doing what I like so it can’t be helped.<br/>
Because I’ve been eagerly awaiting this moment since the day we fought Houou and lost Atla.<br/>
"P-protect Tact! Everyone!" (Woman)<br/>
The women came to their senses and at a earnest-looking, different coloured female knight-like fellow’s supreme command, they readied their rifles.<br/>
Is that it, or rather, is there nothing else?<br/>
Or so I thought, but they also started casting ritual magic.<br/>
It looked like they were thinking somewhat.<br/>
With me alone, you can’t stop me no matter how much you try.<br/>
Of course, this sort of thing was part of our expectations.<br/>
I feel quite nostalgic, but I experienced pain firsthand when I first had that duel with Motoyasu.<br/>
When this sort of fellow gets in a pinch, he composedly pulls off a cowardly attack despite in a fair and square fight.<br/>
So naturally we have considered the enemy’s followers attacking and supporting.<br/>
We only provoked Tact to begin with, so we’ve assembled tactics with the assumption it’d be few vs many.<br/>
Fortunately, the ones high leveled enough to be a threat are fighting Raphtalia and the others so I can take it easy.<br/>
I feel like some of them could be reliable allies.<br/>
"SHOOT-!" (Woman)<br/>
The women aim their rifles at me and pull the trigger.<br/>
Gunshots resound throughout the surroundings.<br/>
But…. in the middle of that, I deployed the defensive measures I had planned.<br/>
In an instant, lead balls came flying towards me.<br/>
Because it’s the marksmanship of rifles fired by level 250 guys,<br/>
they demonstrated an ability that wouldn’t even lose to the rifles from my world.<br/>
Well… I’ve never seen an actual gun in my own world though.<br/>
The women probably believed their attacks hit me.<br/>
In reality, they showed a face of trying to protect their comrade mixed with a hint of impatience.<br/>
I wondered why they didn’t understand if they could show this kind of expression, but it’s not something I care about.<br/>
I’ll trample over that kind of thinking.<br/>
The bullets that tried to penetrate me.<br/>
….Those bullets all hit Tact.<br/>
"Guhaa!" (Tact)<br/>
"Wha―" (Woman)<br/>
The women became speechless and dropped their rifles.<br/>
"Wh-why…." (Woman)<br/>
"Oh dear… what are you doing. You guys are merciless." (Naofumi)<br/>
I rile them up with a smile.<br/>
"Why did our bullets hit Tact!?" (Woman)<br/>
Right, I…. used the techniques I thought out with Atla, [Collect] and [Wall], to change the trajectory of the bullets the women fired and deliver them to Tact.<br/>
Originally [Collect] was very effective for formless attacks such as magic attacks.<br/>
Solid bullets were difficult. However, the current me can do it.<br/>
After that I made use of [Wall] and had the bullets ricochet to hit Tact.<br/>
"How is it, Tact? The taste of the bullets fired by your own women, some of whom are even level 250." (Naofumi)<br/>
"H-how dare you! How dare you make us shoot Tact!" (Woman)<br/>
The woman repeatedly hurled abuse at me while in a rage.<br/>
I’m in a good mood.<br/>
….For me to be in a good mood with this kind of thing, I’ve also changed.<br/>
If the old me was flooded by women screaming jeers in my original world, it probably wouldn’t be strange for me to want to cry.<br/>
It can also be taken as me getting stronger but it’s questionable about whether it’s a good or bad thing.<br/>
"As if I care. Or rather, what are you preaching about justice for when you guys used the cowardly tactic of outnumbering us?" (Naofumi)<br/>
At my reply, the woman was taken aback and sank into silence as if she came to her senses.<br/>
As expected, she probably understood that she had been lacking reason.<br/>
"I’m nice so I’ll cast recovery magic on Tact. Dreifach Heal." (Naofumi)<br/>
Casting Revelation is a pain.<br/>
My Heal must have been effective, Tact’s glare strengthened and he bit his lips.<br/>
"Now then, we’re still continuing. Try putting up with it." (Naofumi)<br/>
In the middle of talking, lightning rained down from the sky.<br/>
If I’m not mistaken, it was the ritual magic, Judgement.<br/>
With their levels all above 250 and enough people to cast Choral Magic, they fired.<br/>
They converged the power of Judgement so that it wouldn’t hit Tact.<br/>
"You’re pretty obstinate." (Naofumi)<br/>
Half mixed with a sigh, I deploy my mirrors in the sky.<br/>
"Sto―" (Woman)<br/>
Oh? There were several people who realised.<br/>
But it’s too late.<br/>
"Go to hell with this!" (Woman)<br/>
Thunder roared and Judgement rained down towards me.<br/>
and adjusted the angle of reflection.<br/>
Ah…. as I expected, the strength is high.<br/>
One of the mirrors broke.<br/>
However the second one was fine, and successfully reflected in accordance with my predictions.<br/>
"Guhaa!" (Tact)<br/>
"Tact!?" (Woman)<br/>
"What are you doing! This guy… seems to have… the power to direct all our attacks to hit Tact." (Woman)<br/>
The women stared at the tattered Tact while lost for words.<br/>
Among them were some who tried to run up and stop it.<br/>
"Hmm… how is it? The taste of the magic your own comrades fired." (Naofumi)<br/>
Even if it’s bad, I have no obligation to take it.<br/>
Or rather, who am I fighting?<br/>
I was meant to be fighting Tact but I’m fighting his followers before I know it.<br/>
As far as it goes, Tact had prepared the shield so it seems he didn’t receive that much damage but even so, it’s only at this level, huh?<br/>
<br/>
