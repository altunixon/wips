“Reason to live, you say……” (Naofumi) <br/>
 <br/>
What kind of relationship do you have?　It’s getting harder to understand. (TL: Between Sadina and Raphtalia) <br/>
Chivalry or Bushido, it seems such a culture existed long ago in my world, but is it close to that? <br/>
 <br/>
“During the first wave, I was unable to protect Raphtalia-chan’s parents. No, when the wave occurred, I was far away and did not rush over. Because it was too peaceful back then, I had let my guard down.” (Sadina) <br/>
 <br/>
Sadina drinks her alcohol while muttering something that sounds like regret. <br/>
This appearance is…… even if I’m wrong, it doesn’t seem like a prank. <br/>
Putting the helplessly drunk Raphtalia to sleep in a plain bed, Sadina continues talking. <br/>
 <br/>
If it’s a serious talk, there’s no reason to handle it cruelly. <br/>
I’ll hear you out sincerely. <br/>
 <br/>
“……But when I finally managed to return a few days later, there was no one left in the village.” (Sadina) <br/>
 <br/>
Sadina continues talking. <br/>
 <br/>
“I looked for her desperately, hoping she had surely survived. However, I was not able to approach the dark side of this country as a Beastman. That’s why I became a battle slave in Zeltbur, which specializes in slaves, and began looking. That place has many connections so I thought I would manage if I accumulated some money.” (Sadina) <br/>
“You took quite a detour.” (Naofumi) <br/>
 <br/>
In reality, Raphtalia was sold ridiculously cheaply. <br/>
Although Sadina was looking frantically, Raphtalia was in the unlikeliest of places. <br/>
 <br/>
“It took too much time trying to find a slave named Raphtalia with the appearance of the Raccoon species. I did find some children from the village though.” (Sadina) <br/>
“Come to think of it, you were protecting slaves from the village.” (Naofumi) <br/>
“Yes. And I was surprised when I found Raphtalia-chan. To think she was with Naofumi-chan, the Hero of the Shield.” (Sadina) <br/>
“It’s full of drama. Raphtalia’s life is.” (Naofumi) <br/>
 <br/>
If possible, I hope that Raphtalia can live in peace after the world has become peaceful. <br/>
Precisely because this child believed in me, I want her to be happy. <br/>
These feelings have not changed even now. <br/>
Even though I think the world ought to be ruined, I will endeavor to make the world peaceful for Raphtalia’s sake. [TC: Naofumi hates the world but will save it so Raphtalia can live in it] <br/>
 <br/>
“You say the appearance of the Raccoon species, but isn’t Raphtalia different?” (Naofumi) <br/>
“Just like I may be mistaken for the Ruka species, she is similar to the Raccoon species but is still a different kind.” (Sadina) [TC: Ruka species = Dolphin species, but Sadina is an Orca] <br/>
“Hmm…… well, Raphtalia is Raphtalia no matter what race she belongs to.” (Naofumi) <br/>
 <br/>
I see. <br/>
That explains why Raphtalia is a beautiful girl, despite supposedly being of the Raccoon species whose appearance is not valued very much. <br/>
 <br/>
“……That’s the good thing about Naofumi-chan. Hey Naofumi-chan…… if you have no intention of taking care of Raphtalia-chan until the end…… why not make do with this Onee-san?” (Sadina) <br/>
“What?” (Naofumi) <br/>
“I hope you have the resolution to be in a relationship with Raphtalia-chan. If there is no resolution, please use Onee-san to let it out if you can no longer endure it.” (Sadina) [TC: ‘If you aren’t resolved then do it with Onee-san if you get horny’] <br/>
“Do you think I am the Devil or something?”  (Naofumi) <br/>
 <br/>
Oh, I am aware of that sort of thing. But even if I die, I don’t want any relations with women. <br/>
If I consider what you are saying… I think you’re talking about a relationship with Raphtalia. <br/>
Of course, I trust Raphtalia. <br/>
If it’s a question of like or dislike, I would say I like her. <br/>
This I can affirm. To the extent of being able to assent if I was told to say it to the person in question. <br/>
 <br/>
But when it is the feeling of love that is called into question… I don’t know. <br/>
For me Raphtalia is a reliable partner, she is the friend with whom I shared my joys and sorrows, and at the same time I think of her as something like a daughter. <br/>
Meaning I think of myself as a foster father, like what Motoyasu has been saying. <br/>
Raphtalia is prioritizing her mission until the world becomes peaceful, and she has parental affection for me rather than having an interest in romance. <br/>
Hey, I’ll lose if I get caught up in Sadina’s pace. <br/>
 <br/>
“What is Raphtalia’s race? I would like to ask for the time being.” (Naofumi) <br/>
“Will you take responsibility since you want to know? Will you look after Raphtalia until the end?” (Sadina) <br/>
 <br/>
When Sadina said until the end, she probably didn’t mean until the wave is over, but until the day Raphtalia dies. <br/>
……I think that I can’t take responsibility in that sense. <br/>
When this world has become peaceful, I intend to return to my original world. <br/>
 <br/>
“I understand. Then I wont ask.” (Naofumi) <br/>
“Is that so… That’s disappointing~” (Sadina) <br/>
 <br/>
Sadina’s numerous acts of interference after Raphtalia came back is probably done out of fear that will I lay a hand on Raphtalia, and she’s learning about my personality as well as making fun of me. <br/>
Sadina’s repeated attack of annoying stories and harassment is probably so I don’t do anything to Raphtalia. <br/>
This person usually plays around, but somehow she has developed the technique of calmly observing the behavior of people and guiding them. <br/>
I’ve overlooked it because there’s no mischief that has been done to me, but I wouldn’t want to be her enemy. <br/>
She said this in a playful tone, but her smile doesn’t reach her eyes. <br/>
 <br/>
“You had a reason to say all this, right? Tell me about it a little, otherwise I won’t be able to protect her.” (Naofumi) <br/>
“Oh, you’ve got a point. Then, just a little bit.” (Sadina) <br/>
 <br/>
Sadina begins talking while lightly stroking Raphtalia’s hair. <br/>
 <br/>
“You might not know, but Raphtalia-chan’s father was of a noble lineage, and I was the priestess who governed that lineage.” (Sadina) <br/>
“Oh…… Silt Welt or Shirudo Furiden?” (Naofumi) <br/>
“It was on the outskirts, but I can’t give you a specific location. Because even this is big service.” (Sadina) <br/>
 <br/>
Was it not a Demi-human country? <br/>
And what position did Sadina have? <br/>
She did say it was a priestess just now…… <br/>
 <br/>
“To be honest Raphtalia’s father didn’t want to succeed his House so he eloped with Raphtalia’s mother. I wonder if he knew that I agreed with his thinking and escaped here?” (Sadina) <br/>
“Did you Lv reset then?” (Naofumi) <br/>
 <br/>
An image of the punishment for rebelling against the law comes to mind. <br/>
 <br/>
“Yes, various things were lost, but there was no dissatisfaction because I had gained a lot of things. I was essentially banished.” (Sadina) <br/>
“Did you get the divine protection of a water dragon by working as a priestess? And compared to the lineage of Raphtalia’s father, who was superior?” (Naofumi) <br/>
“Raphtalia-chan’s father was the most admired in the area.” (Sadina) <br/>
“More so than the Four Saint Heroes?” (Naofumi) <br/>
“There is no folklore of the Heroes, but they have been described by visitors.” (Sadina) <br/>
 <br/>
What kind of area is it? <br/>
It’s lacking in credibility and is becoming dubious. <br/>
But I feel like I have understood what kind of family Raphtalia came from. <br/>
 <br/>
In a certain country she would be worshipped as a descendent, like a child of God. <br/>
Let us deduce from the variety of material that has been provided until now. <br/>
The atmosphere and the name of the knockdown technique Raphtalia invented by herself, the appearance of Sadina’s human form …… <br/>
 <br/>
She’s a Japanese beauty. Sadina in her human form, that is. <br/>
And she habitually uses a loincloth. <br/>
So with ‘Japanese Style’ as a keyword, the eastern place that the Old Man from the weapon shop was talking about before comes to mind. <br/>
 <br/>
“The country where Raphtalia father was born….. was it in seclusion?” (Naofumi) (TL: Sakoku or “locked country” was the foreign relations policy of Japan under which no foreigner could enter nor could any Japanese leave the country on penalty of death) <br/>
“Wow, Naofumi-chan is amazing. It is so. It’s been that way since the past. There are many of such countries besides our country but it is a particularly exclusive area among those countries. ” (Sadina) <br/>
 <br/>
When I look and think about it, it’s such rotten world. <br/>
I have heard that there was also cases where some heroes were summoned in a peaceful time without waves. <br/>
It’s not strange for those guys to escape from the countries that summoned them, and use their knowledge of the modern world to make a Hidden village-like country. [TC: So a larger scaled version where the whole country is secluded] <br/>
That’s why it isn’t weird to have a Japanese country. <br/>
 <br/>
Or rather, it’s weirder for civilization to be stuck in the middle ages despite heroes regularly being summoned from different worlds, especially if you include the super element of magic. <br/>
……Perhaps there is a reason for that, but it doesn’t really matter now. <br/>
 <br/>
“Are you worried about that country?” (Naofumi) <br/>
 <br/>
The country is secluded in the east. <br/>
There is a country which looks like Japan, and Raphtalia has relatives with noble linage there. <br/>
Does she feel like a pursuer will come to retrieve Raphtalia if it gets badly exposed? <br/>
 <br/>
“You’re only half-correct, but that’s alright. I’ve been worried about Raphtalia’s own happiness.” (Sadina) <br/>
“Uhh……” (Raphtalia) <br/>
 <br/>
Sadina puts a cloth soaked in cold water on Raphtalia’s forehead when she hears her groan. <br/>
 <br/>
“She will be waking up soon. Is there anything else you want to ask?” (Sadina) <br/>
“Why don’t you speak to Raphtalia about this?” (Naofumi) <br/>
“It’s the directive of Raphtalia-chan’s father.” (Sadina) <br/>
 <br/>
Pardon me for being involved with Raphtalia’s family affairs like this though. <br/>
Let’s deal with this after the world is at peace. <br/>
But then the Church of the Three Heroes and the nobles are also like that. <br/>
 <br/>
“Is it alright?” (Naofumi) <br/>
“I think so. They won’t come unless you know too much.” (Sadina) <br/>
“……About their domestic affairs?” (Naofumi) <br/>
 <br/>
Sadina nods silently. <br/>
Ah, so it comes to that, as I expected. <br/>
So Raphtalia comes from a troublesome lineage. <br/>
To me, an ordinary beauty of the Raccoon species would have been good. <br/>
I see, so Sadina wants me to continue keeping it that way. <br/>
 <br/>
Lets assume I got involved with Raphtalia and made a child with her. <br/>
Then Raphtalia, pregnant with a child by me who is considered a God by some countries, might get targeted. <br/>
Sadina is concerned about the possibility and is taking precaution. <br/>
 <br/>
“If you really want a child with Raphtalia no matter what, do it after you stop worrying about the whole country being destroyed. It’s a promise with Onee-san. The current Naofumi-chan is capable of doing that.” (Sadina) [TC: ‘Stop worrying about the waves and focus 100% on Raphtalia’] <br/>
“Aren’t you being too paranoid?” (Naofumi) <br/>
 <br/>
She’s thinking too much about understanding the big picture. <br/>
Of course it’s better to be a bit cautious. <br/>
 <br/>
“That may be true but you must not underestimate a priestess or user of unique abilities. If someone like me is idling about, they may be aiming for Raphtalia’s life.” (Sadina) <br/>
“I see.” (Naofumi) <br/>
 <br/>
A country full of people with abilities like Sadina…… I would like to ask them to help save the world. <br/>
Since Raphtalia is extremely strong, she won’t be killed easily. <br/>
But even so, I won’t do something so irresponsible. <br/>
 <br/>
“I wonder if Naofumi-chan has arrived at an actual decision. Onee-san doesn’t want you to do things that would make a girl cry. Though it’s fine because Onee-san is not a girl but an adult woman.” (Sadina) <br/>
“Various reasons are being piled up now.” (Naofumi) <br/>
“Nuu, Onee-san is troubled.” (Sadina) [TC: Nuu = no, but more colliquial-ish? Idk how to describe it] <br/>
 <br/>
There was also the problem of Raphtalia’s parentage of course, but Sadina wanted to ask about my own feelings. <br/>
That much was conveyed. <br/>
 <br/>
“Uhh…… Naofumi-sama?” (Raphtalia) <br/>
 <br/>
Raphtalia, who has recovered consciousness, gets up. <br/>
 <br/>
“Are you okay?” (Naofumi) <br/>
“Ah, yes. I feel fine, strangely.” (Raphtalia) <br/>
“That’s good.” (Sadina) <br/>
“Did anything happen while I was passed out?” (Raphtalia) <br/>
“……Not really.”  (Sadina) <br/>
 <br/>
Sadina probably doesn’t want to tell her the truth. <br/>
I also pretend I didn’t hear anything because I don’t want to cause unnecessary trouble. <br/>
 <br/>
“That’s right. I just said that Raphtalia is like a daughter to me.” (Naofumi) <br/>
“Right!?” (Raphtalia) <br/>
______________________________________________________________________________________________ <br/>
“That’s right. I also mentioned that Raphtalia is something like a Fluffy-Tailed Waifu to me.” (Naofumi)* <br/>
“Hai!?” (Raphtalia) <br/>
 <br/>
*gag line by Rarstyak <br/>
______________________________________________________________________________________________ <br/>
 <br/>
Raphtalia, who raised her voice in surprise, tentatively nodded in agreement. <br/>
‘If I have come to like Raphtalia then show my resolution’…… it’s a troublesome topic. <br/>
I won’t permanently reside in this world. <br/>
I think so at least. <br/>
 <br/>
“I was told by Sadina, with her noninterference policy, to protect Raphtalia as a parent.” (Naofumi) <br/>
 <br/>
I say sarcastically and in an ostentatious way. <br/>
Because despite wanting to protect you, I neglected you while you were out training. <br/>
 <br/>
“Isn’t that called ‘If you love your children, send them out into the world’, Naofumi-chan.” (Sadina) [TC: Japanese idiom…. But Naofumi didn’t say that aloud, is Sadina reading his thoughts? o.0] <br/>
 <br/>
Sadina murmurs absent mindlessly. <br/>
 <br/>
“Naofumi-chan may not realize, but someone who becomes the slave of a Hero has an unnaturally good experience rate, and there’s also the growth of the status. To the extent that half-hearted opponents are no match for us.” (Sadina) <br/>
“How good is it?” (Naofumi) <br/>
“In my experience, it should have taken several years to reach the same Lv. Please keep that in mind.” (Sadina) <br/>
 <br/>
I see, becoming a slave to a Hero can give you good experience gain. <br/>
That reminds me, Fohl also said something similar. <br/>
Moreover, there’s the influence of growth correction. <br/>
 <br/>
“Then, getting a good Lv is possibly due to Naofumi-sama’s influence?” (Raphtalia) <br/>
“That’s right. Onee-san has done many Lv resets and guarantees it.” (Sadina) <br/>
“Now that you mentioned it, Teacher also said something similar. About Leveling quickly.” (Raphtalia) <br/>
 <br/>
Somehow it seems as though the Hero correction thing also has some influence on companions. <br/>
I have felt it a little bit though. <br/>
 <br/>
“That’s why Onee-san has also become very strong.” (Sadina) <br/>
“You couldn’t possibly have been going easy on me as an opponent?” (Raphtalia) <br/>
“I couldn’t have done something like going easy on you. Raphtalia-chan has become very strong. Onee-san could have been defeated.” (Sadina) <br/>
 <br/>
We finished chatting like this and returned to our respective homes to sleep. <br/>
By the way, Gaelion enjoyed drinking the liquor he got from Sadina.
