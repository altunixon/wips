Thank you, everyone, for purchasing the sixth volume of "Cooking with Wild Game".<br/>
Time flies, and the first volume has been out for more than a year.<br/>
As I’m writing this afterword, February is coming to a close; I hope everyone can take care of me this year too.<br/>
And so, this is already the sixth volume of this series.<br/>
This volume detracts from the business in the Post Station Town and focuses on the Forest’s Edge settlement again.<br/>
The denizens of Forest’s Edge face off directly with the negative influence of the Tsun clan.<br/>
Some readers might browse through the afterword before reading the main story so I will refrain from mentioning the story, but, compared to the struggles in the Post Station Town, this volume’s content has a different appeal to it.<br/>
Asuta and Ai Fa’s goals remained unchanged; I hope they can overcome all obstacles and move towards a bright future.<br/>
Ai Fa finally got onto the cover of Volume 6 after a long absence.<br/>
Speaking of which, the main heroine didn’t appear on the cover of the volumes four and five.<br/>
Ai Fa can finally smile again.<br/>
Whenever a new volume is published, this series will illustrate new characters. And this time, they are all male.<br/>
And there are six of them. This is the first time we are adding illustration for so many characters. Three of them were drawn due to the strong demand by the author, so I’m very grateful for this.<br/>
To avoid spoilers, I won’t mention who they are, but they made their debut at the same time.<br/>
Their names aren’t revealed in this volume, but they are key characters for this arc, so I strongly wished for them to be illustrated.<br/>
In a sense, they were scarier than Papa Donda.<br/>
When I first received the draft illustration, my heart skipped a beat from how intimidating they looked.<br/>
This humble author realized once again how fortunate I am that Kochimo-sensei is doing the illustration for me.<br/>
Next is the mid-meal snack that is published for the first time. I chose the easterner Shumimaru who didn’t show up in this volume as the main character.<br/>
As the main story was rather serious, I was planning to write about the wonderful lives of a cute girl in the mid-meal snack, but when I realized it, the mid-meal snack was as serious as the main story.<br/>
The author really likes Shumimaru, and I hope everyone will like this story as well.<br/>
Well then, in the next volume, Asuta and the others will get embroiled in new tribulations.<br/>
They will restart their business in the Post Station Town.<br/>
Kamyua Yost who had been quiet for some time will make an appearance again.<br/>
In order to let the readers enjoy this work, the author will strive forth too.<br/>
Well then, I will sign off with the usual by thanking my editor from HOBBY JAPAN, the illustrator Kochimo-sensei, all the staff who helped in the publishing of this volume, and all the readers who bought this book. Allow me to give you my most sincere thanks.<br/>
Let’s meet again in the next volume!<br/>
