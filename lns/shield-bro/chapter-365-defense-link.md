Chapter 365: Defense Link<br/>
"Queen Melty, hurry and evacuate!"<br/>
"I am the Queen here! I cannot flee from the battlefield."<br/>
The enemy’s forces had pushed all the way to Melty, who was giving orders in the rear.<br/>
Including Itsuki, and the other Heroes, even Firo is being hard pressed by the advancing armies.<br/>
In a situation like that, Melty rushed to the field herself, and started offering support fire.<br/>
"Guhah!"<br/>
One of the soldiers protecting her was cut down.<br/>
They’re at a complete numerical disadvantage.<br/>
If you think about it normally, they’ve been pushed to a state where their defeat is all but assured.<br/>
The reincarnators attacks are reaching back far enough to damage Melty, the commander.<br/>
"Ah…"<br/>
A weapon wraps around Melty, and drags her off. She lets out a small voice at the event.<br/>
But even the Reincarnator holding it hesitates when it comes to killing a small girl like her. He opens his mouth.<br/>
"Is this the enemy commander? She’s just a child, isn’t she?"<br/>
"Hey take her in, I’ll let her into my Harem."<br/>
"Mel-chan!" (Firo)<br/>
"Queen Melty!"<br/>
Firo starts her assault to save her friend from the men who were saying things she didn’t understand.<br/>
Her Vassal, the Claw, lets off a soft light.<br/>
Yes, while Firo is like that, she’s the Hero of the Claw, and Melty’s best friend.<br/>
There’s no way she’ll lose against any normal enemy.<br/>
"Don’t get in the way, bird!"<br/>
"Move! Mel-chan!" (Firo)<br/>
But the Reincarnator halts her advance.<br/>
While Firo’s gotten stronger as the Hero of the claw, her enemy also holds a vassal, and has received a strange power from the Goddess.<br/>
「Spiral Claw Ten」!<br/>
Ever since the Goddess Descended, the Reincarnators have been imbued with powerful support magic.<br/>
Because of that, they can be considered stronger than the Heroes.<br/>
Or else there’s no way Firo and the others would be driven to a corner so easily.<br/>
"Whoa."<br/>
The powerful attack Firo unleashed was dodged by the man.<br/>
"That was dangerous, bird."<br/>
"Ku… move!"<br/>
Female Knight presses Musou Kassei to the limit, and starts slashing at him.<br/>
But with his unnaturally high support effects, it’s hard to contest with the reincarnated soul.<br/>
"It seems this she’s pretty important, this girl."<br/>
"I mean, we were told it was alright if all we did was capture her, right?"<br/>
"She’s a bishojo, so I’ll have her fall for my charms."<br/>
"W-who would fall for someone like you!?" (Melty)<br/>
"This is the last time you’ll be able to say that. You’ll soon realize my true appeal."<br/>
"Melty! Get your hands off of my daughter!" (Trash)<br/>
Trash yells out.<br/>
But if he were to fire a skill, Melty would be hit too.<br/>
"Father!" (Melty)<br/>
"What a Foolish King…. My planning was so many levels over yours, was it not?"<br/>
"What the hell are you saying!? You merely used your numerical advantage! And whenever anything bad happened, you relied on that woman!" (Melty)<br/>
Displeased with Melty’s response, the Reincarnator began to glare at her.<br/>
At the same time, Melty chanted magic.<br/>
「Dreifach Aqua Slash」!’<br/>
A blade of water slices him point blank.<br/>
It inflicted a light cut on his face, before coming to a stop.<br/>
"So you’ll lash out at me? Never mind, it doesn’t seem you’re worthy of my charms. Die! For world peace!"<br/>
The Reincarnator’s scythe swings down towards Melty…<br/>
Melty clenches her eyes closed.<br/>
And…<br/>
"For me to appear at a time like this, there must be something wrong with me."<br/>
With perfect timing, I protect Melty in a heroic fashion.<br/>
I stop the Scythe with one hand, and hide Melty under my mantle with the other.<br/>
Just like that day… It was the same scene as when I protected her from the Three Hero Church Knights trying to kill her.<br/>
"So you were aiming for that timing?"<br/>
As he guessed the situation, Ren lifted his sword, and pointed it at the other Reincarnator.<br/>
Well, it’s not strange for him to think that by looking at that display.<br/>
"No, I really did arrive at the nick of time." (Naofumi)<br/>
"N-Naofumi!?" (Melty)<br/>
"Yeah." (Naofumi)<br/>
It’s an emotional reunion.<br/>
In Manga and Games, this would be where she would cry tears of Joy and cling to me, but…<br/>
"I who has understood the origin of power command…"<br/>
"Why are you firing magic at me without giving me a chance to speak!?" (Naofumi)<br/>
"So she’s finally revived Naofumi to torment us! Damn you Goddess!"<br/>
Ah… yeah, it seems quite a bit has happened.<br/>
So much that the Four Holy Weapons’ Manual wasn’t able to contain it all.<br/>
But why are they firing magic the second they see my face?<br/>
"Mel-chan! Fake Master, release Mel-chan!" (Firo)<br/>
Even Firo is glaring at me.<br/>
She even released a skill.<br/>
「Screw Claw Ten」!<br/>
I hold my hand out front, and stop Firo’s kick.<br/>
Why do I have to take both of these girls on at the same time?<br/>
Even Female Knight’s giving me the evil eye.<br/>
My risen tension’s been crashed all at once.<br/>
Wel, I also feel that I was getting a bit ahead of myself having gained a new power, so maybe this is for the best.<br/>
"Well, I know you won’t believe me, but the Spirits allowed the Four Heroes to escape to their original worlds. And like this, I’ve now returned." (Naofumi)<br/>
"That’s a lie! The Naofumi I know can’t stop Firo-chan’s kick!" (Melty)<br/>
"I wasn’t that weak!" (Naofumi)<br/>
If it was a Firo-Class attack, I think the past me could have stopped it.<br/>
… Right? I could have stopped it, right?<br/>
"Now then… For now, I was able to get in easier than I thought." (Naofumi)<br/>
I ignore Melty’s magic, and turn to the Reincarnator.<br/>
This is… I don’t think I’ll have to show any of my trumpcards here.<br/>
From what I can see, it looks like Trash has mastered Revelation Class magic.<br/>
I can tell from the supports cast on Firo.<br/>
Itsuki is… fighting on the front lines, it seems.<br/>
Fohl is quite close by.<br/>
He’s evenly fighting back right now.<br/>
"Fumu."<br/>
I activate the Shield, and look for a skill I can use.<br/>
As long as the world allows it, all skills that the Shield can use in the world have been unlocked!<br/>
… No, I can’t really say that. Just how long is this list?<br/>
Well, if it’s just to the extent of the skills a normal Hero can learn, I can use them. That’s a bit of the power I have.<br/>
「Defense Link EX」!<br/>
I hold out the Shield, and call out a Skill Name.<br/>
This is the first time I’m using this one.<br/>
It’s the first time I’m learning a skill directly from the Shield, but there’s no way I can’t use it.<br/>
The Skill Defense Link was just as it sounds.<br/>
Its effect was… all attacks those I consider allies take are treated as attacks directed at me. I can shoulder all the damage.<br/>
EX is… a Hero’s limit.<br/>
There are some levels above, but so the Goddess won’t notice, I’ll stop at this.<br/>
A barrier-like membrane is deployed around a large area, as I activate the skill to protect my comrades.<br/>
With half-hearted defense, the skill is suicide.<br/>
Of course, the current me can take this with ease.<br/>
Protect everyone. That’s my role.<br/>
Never again will attacks reach my comrades behind me.<br/>
The radius is about 20 meters. If I raise the output further, I feel the bitch will notice it.<br/>
I don’t really have a reason to hold back, but I don’t know what will happen, so I’ll do it in moderation.<br/>
Now’s not the time for me to get serious yet.<br/>
If they run after realizing they can’t beat me, that would be terrible.<br/>
I’ll wait for Raphtalia and the others to get here before I really start exerting myself.<br/>
"Ren." (Naofumi)<br/>
"What?" (Ren)<br/>
"Don’t dodge, just cut at them." (Naofumi)<br/>
"Wha—Are you telling me to die!?" (Ren)<br/>
"I used a power to make it alright. Just go do it!" (Naofumi)<br/>
The sound of metal hitting metal echoes all over my body.<br/>
I mean, I’m taking the damage of all those around me at once, so it’s to be expected.<br/>
"A-ah."<br/>
The surrounding solders find themselves dumbfound after feeling no damage while being cut.<br/>
Seeing that, Ren timidly drops his defense as he struck his sword at the reincarnators.<br/>
"You’re not dodging? Are you an idiot?"<br/>
"Take this! 「Variable Messiah」!"<br/>
"What!?"<br/>
I’ll bet the Reincarnator intended to cleave Ren in half in that single swing.<br/>
He was smiling, but as he saw Ren standing intact, his expression warped.<br/>
And Ren’s sword starts glittering brilliantly. It becomes giant, and he starts swinging it downward on the enemy.<br/>
Oh, that’s quite a flashy skill.<br/>
Ren definitely didn’t know that one before.<br/>
Oh right. Ren did say he went to another world once.<br/>
It’s probably a Sword Skill he acquired at that time.<br/>
Does he hold anything else you can only find in another world?<br/>
No, I don’t really need them, but I’ll bet the others do.<br/>
"Uuu… I feel like I shouldn’t be alive, Naofumi." (Ren)<br/>
"But you’re fine, right?" (Naofumi)<br/>
If you move your body along with the blade, and dodge by a manner of millimeters, you can eliminate all unnecessary movements, but that sort of style doesn’t suit me.<br/>
If the enemies can’t do any damage in the first place, you can just ignore their attacks without dodging.<br/>
That means, by nature, they can now attack faster than anybody else.<br/>
Well, it’s not really a strategy to be praised, though.<br/>
"Even so, it’s not something I’d like to use often. I’m scared for when the time comes where it seems natural." (Ren)<br/>
"If you show such leisure before the enemy, you’ll die!"<br/>
The Reincarnator tries to act cool as he attacks Ren from behind.<br/>
"Leisure? I’d like to call it trust, you know." (Ren)<br/>
"Guwah!"<br/>
Holding his sword behind him, Ren lightly parries the reincarnator’s attacks before slashing him.<br/>
"Oh my… you’ve gotten better." (Naofumi)<br/>
His movements are sharper.<br/>
On the contrary, his basic abilities have risen a few levels.<br/>
It’s like a fight between an amateur and a novice, he’s showing a complete difference in power. Something like that.<br/>
It appears that his claims to be stronger were no lie.<br/>
"By the way… Melty, Firo. I’d like it if you stopped already." (Naofumi)<br/>
For a while now, Melty and Firo have been unleashing a stream of coordinated magic attacks and skills ayt me.<br/>
‘You must be in pain, being controlled by the enemy. Don’t worry, I’ll give you peace.’<br/>
‘Master, Firo will get over your death. Firo will try harder, so you can sleep now.’ It’s like they’re saying those sorts of words of parting.<br/>
I thought I had made quite a dramatic entrance, but I’m being treated like a Zombie.<br/>
"I keep telling you I’m not Dead!" (Naofumi)<br/>
"I’ll reveal your true form!" (Melty)<br/>
"Yeah, Master is…" (Firo)<br/>
"Just quit it already!" (Naofumi)<br/>
"… This is a tragedy brought about by the trust they placed in you, and the Goddess’s underhanded tactics."<br/>
Ren starts muttering with an amazed expression.<br/>
Please stop. My body doesn’t hurt, but my heart can’t take it anymore.<br/>
And as if he just noticed her, Ren started waving his hand at Female Knight, and calling her name.<br/>
"Eclaire!" (Ren)<br/>
"Who are you!?" (Female Knight)<br/>
Ah, Ren looks really hurt.<br/>
He reunited with the person he liked after two years, but this is the outcome.<br/>
"It’s me! Ren. Please believe me!" (Ren)<br/>
"the Ren I knew was a childish youth. He definitely wasn’t someone like you! If you plan on deceiving me, try putting a little more effort into it!" (Female Knight)<br/>
Should I just use some power to revert him after all?<br/>
But if I do that before their eyes, they’ll definitely recognize me as an enemy.<br/>
"Trash! Just figure it out already!" (Naofumi)<br/>
"Nu!?" (Trash)<br/>
Since I had been standing still without showing any resistance for a while, it seems Trash figured something out.<br/>
"Melty, that Iwatani-dono doesn’t show signs of being an enemy. I think it’s alright if we trust him a bit." (Trash)<br/>
"Father… but…" (Melty)<br/>
"I understand your sentiment, but after he’s done this much for us, we have no option but to rely on him in this battle." (Trash)<br/>
It’s finally reached a stage where I can talk.<br/>
"Now then, Trash. I’ve a little bit of information about the situation up until I was able to get here. Fighting the Queen is definitely unpleasant, but will refraining from doing so make your wife happy?" (Naofumi)<br/>
"Nu…"<br/>
My words turn Trash’s expression bitter.<br/>
He’s been through some pain, but I won’t let this reach a bad ending.<br/>
I’ll definitely save Melty and Firo… Everyone.<br/>
"You don’t have to give an answer yet. But in this war, just how much of Melromark will become victims? Will that delight the Queen?" (Naofumi)<br/>
"… Iwatani-dono’s words are correct. Everyone! Follow Iwatani-dono’s lead! Melty, follow my orders, and take command." (Trash)<br/>
"Y-yes father! … It’s not like I trust you or anything, Naofumi." (Melty)<br/>
She let loose some Tsundere-esque lines, that girl.<br/>
Similarly, Firo seems to have grieving over my death, so she’s still half in doubt about me.<br/>
"I know." (Naofumi)<br/>
For the love of god, when I get back, I’m treated like a zombie.<br/>
That Goddess sure likes picking a fight.<br/>
<br/>
