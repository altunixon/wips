<br/>
Quite a few familiar faces from the Christmas Special have started to pop up…<br/>
Chapter 131: Where We Met<br/>
"Where do you plan to head next?" (Rafatalia)<br/>
"I think I have to see the guy I don’t want to meet." (Naofumi)<br/>
"What?" (Rafatalia)<br/>
"Eh-?" (Firo)<br/>
"W-where would that be?" (Rishia)<br/>
Rafatalia looks at the path I’m following. She seems to understand. She holds back a sigh.<br/>
I’m surprised she could guess from that sentence. Is she an esper?<br/>
… I guess she had saw it coming when I obtained the land.<br/>
"Are you selling Firo?" (Firo)<br/>
"Is that man really that scary?" (Naofumi)<br/>
Firo seems to understand as well. She looks at me with the eyes of an abandoned puppy.<br/>
Firo usually acts quite carefree, but I guess she got a trauma from this place.<br/>
Though I think she could kill that man instantly if she set her mind to it.<br/>
Is it that phenomena where an elephant has his leg tied to a tree as a child, so he doesn’t try to run away as an adult? (TL: See Baby Elephant Syndrome)<br/>
It might be something like that.<br/>
"Calm down, I’m not selling anyone." (Naofumi)<br/>
"I got it…" (Firo)<br/>
"Eh? Wha?" (Rishia)<br/>
Rishia… she’s a noble so she probably knows.<br/>
Granted, a fallen noble. There is also a chance she doesn’t.<br/>
I head down a back street and end up in front of the ever-so-familiar tent.<br/>
"My, my…" (Slave Dealer)<br/>
The slave dealer, who I don’t want to meet, greets me with a bored expression.<br/>
If you think about it, there are very few people who would go out to buy slaves in the middle of the day.<br/>
This person is more famous in the town as a Monster Merchant.<br/>
"If it isn’t the Hero of the Shield. It’s been quite a while. I’ve heard much about your victory." (Slave Dealer)<br/>
"Yeah, it’s been a while." (Naofumi)<br/>
"I was sure you had forgotten about me." (Slave Dealer)<br/>
"I wouldn’t be able to forget about a shady character like you even if I tried." (Naofumi)<br/>
It’s quite hard to forget this man. He has a sort of unique aura.<br/>
It’s a feeling similar to the accessory merchant.<br/>
I guess he needs to act like that to run this business.<br/>
The last time I was here was when I came to purchase Firo’s claws. It was around the time I was forbidden from using Class Up.<br/>
At that time, I had tried to escape to Silt Welt or Shield Freiden to Class Up Firo and Rafatalia.<br/>
I believe that this man had some connection to the Queen… Though he has never personally met her.<br/>
"You’ve been quite busy. I didn’t think you would have dubious ties to this country’s government." (Naofumi)<br/>
"That doesn’t change the fact that I approached the Hero of the Shield because I found him interesting." (Slave Dealer)<br/>
"Yes, I’m aware of that." (Naofumi)<br/>
"Now then, how can I help you today?" (Slave Dealer)<br/>
"It’s about your real profession." (Naofumi)<br/>
"Oh!" (Slave Dealer)<br/>
The Slave Dealers eyes sparkle for a moment.<br/>
What are you so excited about. Don’t think it will be easy to short-change me.<br/>
Is he happy that a famous person like me is fighting with his slaves?<br/>
While this is a fact, that doesn’t mean they are powerful because I bought them from you, you know.<br/>
"What price range are you looking in?" (Slave Dealer)<br/>
Currently, I have 5000 silver coins remaining of what the Queen gave me.<br/>
I’ll need the old man to make some more weapons, so I shouldn’t spend to frivolously here.<br/>
"For now, I would like to purchase some Demi-Human slaves around the price of 3000 Silver Coins. If possible, I would like them to be of low level." (Naofumi)<br/>
"What do you plan to use them for?" (Slave Dealer)<br/>
"Why do I need to tell you?" (Naofumi)<br/>
"I know. You acquired some land and need some slaves there." (Slave Dealer)<br/>
"I think I’ve said this before, but don’t ask for things you already know." (Naofumi)<br/>
Really, how much does this person know… If he told me he could see the future, I might believe him.<br/>
"Please come over here." (Slave Dealer)<br/>
The Slave Dealer leads me to the back of the tent.<br/>
As we start to follow him, Firo stops us.<br/>
"What is it?" (Naofumi)<br/>
"… I don’t want to go." (Firo)<br/>
It seems the darkness of the tent and the smells are setting off her trauma.<br/>
I’m already used to it, but I know it isn’t a nice scent.<br/>
"Do you want to wait over there?" (Naofumi)<br/>
"Yeah…" (Firo)<br/>
Fir nods as she stumbles towards the monster egg display.<br/>
You know Firo, that’s where we first met you.<br/>
Don’t eat those, I warn her, as I continue to follow the Slave Dealer.<br/>
"Um… What are we looking for?" (Rishia)<br/>
"We’re going to get people in positions similar to yours." (Naofumi)<br/>
"Fueeee!?"(Rishia)<br/>
"Even though fallen, you’re still a noble, aren’t you? And before Itsuki saved you, you were in a similar situation weren’t you? Please read the situation." (Naofumi)<br/>
This country has an active slave trade. Nobles and other rich folk should be well aware of its existence.<br/>
Why is Rishia so surprised?<br/>
Is she unexpectedly quite dense?<br/>
"T-this is a… I never noticed." (Rishia)<br/>
"But they don’t deal in human trade." (Naofumi)<br/>
"I see…" (Rishia)<br/>
We follow the slave dealer, and end up near the cages where I first saw Rafatalia.<br/>
"… This is where my fate changed…" (Rafatalia)<br/>
I am also reminiscing about that time.<br/>
Though it wasn’t that long ago, it feels like years have passed.<br/>
"Let me pick out some slaves that are within your budget. I’ll even give you a slight discount." (Slave Dealer)<br/>
"How generous." (Naofumi)<br/>
"I hear you are starting up quite an interesting town. It’s quite exiting! Perhaps you will become my best customer after this." (Slave Dealer)<br/>
"Well… I just come to fulfill my needs." (Naofumi)<br/>
"Though business may seem to be slow today, I have already earned a large profit from The Hero of the Shield’s fame." (Slave Dealer)<br/>
"What do you mean by that?" (Naofumi)<br/>
"During negotiations, if I bring up your name, they expect their new slaves to turn out like your companions. Even if I overcharge, they seem to knowingly accept it." (Slave Dealer)<br/>
Rafatalia did earn herself quite a bit of fame during the last battle.<br/>
She outclassed the entire continental army in ability. If people learned this is the place that sold her, I guess business will improve greatly.<br/>
"Ah, besides those, there is also another type of slave I wish to purchase." (Naofumi)<br/>
"What may you be interested in?" (Slave Dealer)<br/>
In response to the Slave Dealer’s question, I turn my focus to Rafatalia.<br/>
I approach her head on and put my arm on her shoulder.<br/>
"W-what is it?" (Rafatalia)<br/>
"Rafatalia, is there anyone here from the village you used to live in? I don’t care about the price, pick anybody you recognize." (Naofumi)<br/>
"!?" (Rafatalia)<br/>
Rafatalia widens her eyes in surprise.<br/>
"U-um… Are you really okay with that?" (Rafatalia)<br/>
"What are you saying at this point in time? Employing people who used to live in that land is the most efficient option for reconstruction. They might have to fight a bit, but our main objective for now is resettling the land." (Naofumi)<br/>
Rafatalia probably has the wish to go back to the village she used to live in tucked in somewhere in her heart.<br/>
It occurred to me when I visited the graveyard with Rafatalia. I need to work hard so that when I leave this world, Rafatalia will still have a place to call home. Even if I’m gone…<br/>
Of course that isn’t my only reason.<br/>
Rafatalia’s former village is on the sea, and if you walk a few hours from it, you can reach the mountains<br/>
As people used to live there, the ground is relatively level and ready for agriculture.<br/>
It’s the perfect area for testing various things.<br/>
(TL: It’s perfect for both farming and Farming)<br/>
Because of the wave, I won’t be kicking anyone out of their homes either.<br/>
"Oh, Slave Dealer, can you ask around the store you got Rafatalia at? I’m willing to buy back slaves from nobles if I must. They’ll probably be willing to part with them if you mention the Hero of the Shield." (Naofumi)<br/>
My popularity is rising in this country. There’s no reason I shouldn’t use that.<br/>
"You plan to motivate your slaves by giving them their previous homes, all while putting them to work? The thought process of the Shield intrigues me! I understand. I’ll ask around." (Slave Dealer)<br/>
"Now then, Rafatalia, do you see any familiar faces?" (Naofumi)<br/>
"… Please give me a moment." (Rafatalia)<br/>
On a side note, that silk hat… he seems to jump on board any idea I suggest.<br/>
I’m scared of his ulterior motives. I’ll investigate his movements later.<br/>
The Slave Dealer shows Rafatalia around the cages containing the slaves, and she carefully examines each individual one.<br/>
"-Found one!" (Rafatalia)<br/>
So there was one.<br/>
Rafatalia is pointing her finger at a Demi-Human child… It’s a man with dog-like features. His age seems to be around 10. He’s a little larger than Rafatalia was when I first met her.<br/>
"You’re Kiel-kun, right?" (Rafatalia)<br/>
"…Who are you? Why do you know my name?" (Kiel)<br/>
So he wasn’t listening to our previous conversation.<br/>
"You forgot my face? I might have gotten a bit bigger, but I’m Rafatalia." (Rafatalia)<br/>
"Eh!?" (Kiel)<br/>
The boy named Kiel looks quite surprised.<br/>
"That’s a lie. The Rafatalia-chan I knew was smaller than me, and she isn’t as beautiful as you. Though she was kinda cute…" (Kiel)<br/>
Kiel says this as if talking about a deceased person.<br/>
"Then I’ll prove to you I’m the real thing. Two months before that incident happened, you were looking for a pretty shell to give Father for his birthday so you dived into the ocean. You almost drowned, so Sadina jumped in to rescue you and together, you…" (Rafatalia)<br/>
"…Eh!? Are you really… Rafatalia-chan?" (Kiel)<br/>
"That’s right, and after that, remember when you accidentally ate a poison mushroom you found in the field, messed up your stomach, and hid to avoid being scolded? You told me to keep it a secret when I found you. You had even wet your pa-" (Rafatalia)<br/>
"Wai-! Yes! I believe you! You’re Rafatalia-chan." (Kiel)<br/>
Memories from the past? How charming.<br/>
But the contents seem to be quite embarrassing.<br/>
"Rafatalia-chan. Why did you become so big… so pretty?" (Kiel)<br/>
"You know, I am currently the slave of the Hero of the Shield." (Rafatalia)<br/>
"Eh!?" (Kiel)<br/>
"Naofumi-sama is quite a trustworthy person. And by his request, I am currently searching for the people who used to live in our village." (Rafatalia)<br/>
"D-do you mean me? Can I finally go back home?" (Kiel)<br/>
"Yes, but… You will be employed as Naofumi-sama’s slave, and put to work. I guarantee he won’t do anything evil, though. Do you want to come with us?" (Rafatalia)<br/>
The child Kiel fidgets and blinks a lot as he listens to Rafatalia’s request.<br/>
His face is slightly pale.<br/>
"Is the Hero of the Shield that man over there?" (Kiel)<br/>
Kiel stares at me.<br/>
What’s with that attitude.<br/>
"That’s right. He might have an evil look around his eyes, and he might have a habit of smiling cynically whenever something bad happens to the people he dislikes, but he’s a good person." (Rafatalia)<br/>
"Are you even trying to persuade him?" (Naofumi)<br/>
She seems to be casually throwing in complaints against me. She’s grown to be quite confident.<br/>
But trying to persuade someone with those words is impossible.<br/>
If it were me, those words would make me even more cautious.<br/>
If I heard those words, I would think that Rafatalia had been brainwashed by a shady person.<br/>
… It hurts that her complaints are right on the mark.<br/>
"He’s the hero that saved this country. Don’t you know about him?" (Rafatalia)<br/>
"Now that you mention it, it has been getting noisy as of late… Will I really be able to go back to that village?" (Kiel)<br/>
"Yeah. Your mother and father… won’t be there, but if we work hard together, we can rebuild that village." (Rafatalia)<br/>
"…I understand." (Kiel)<br/>
Kiel nods and grabs Rafatalia’s outstretched hand.<br/>
"I’ll add him to your purchase, Please continue to pick out slaves with that girl." (Slave Dealer)<br/>
"I’ll need to prepare a few things in regards to that matter. Leave that to us." (Naofumi)<br/>
"Yes!" (Rafatalia)<br/>
"Fufufu, I feel that it will be getting interesting around here." (Slave Dealer)<br/>
"Let’s go, Rishia." (Naofumi)<br/>
"How wonderful…Yes!" (Rishia)<br/>
Rishia follow closely with teary eyes.<br/>
Does Rishia not do well with these sort of stories? She seems like she would be an avid reader.<br/>
(TL: I believe Rishia is crying for joy at Kiel and Rafatalia reuniting)<br/>
Firo suddenly runs over.<br/>
"Are you done yet?" (Firo)<br/>
"Oh right… Firo, there’s a favor I would like to ask of you." (Naofumi)<br/>
"What?" (Firo)<br/>
"Please take Rishi and go level grind for a bit. Go hunt until you feel satisfied." (Naofumi)<br/>
"Fue?" (Rishia)<br/>
Firo’s eyes sparkle and Rishia lets out a confused sound.<br/>
What is so surprising?<br/>
Did you forget about wanting to get stronger?<br/>
"I’m going have to train my newly attained slaves anyways, so this will be good practice. Also, I will be troubled if Rishia stays at level 1 for too long." (Naofumi)<br/>
"B-but how am I supposed to train with Firo-san?" (Rishia)<br/>
"Don’t worry, you just have to ride Firo and make sure you don’t fall off. You’ll still gain EXP. Firo’s carriage is a rough vehicle to ride, you may need to train yourself. Rafatalia went down this road herself. This is killing two birds in one stone."<br/>
It’s a leveling strategy often used in online games.  It’s also used in various console RPGs.<br/>
A high level character fights with minimal support from a low-level one.<br/>
If I leave it to Firo, things should turn out just fine.<br/>
"Then, Firo will be off~!" (Firo)<br/>
"Fuee!?" (Rishia)<br/>
Firo turns into her monster form, grabs Rishia and throws her on her back. She then proceeds to sprint out of the tent.<br/>
"FUEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeee-" (Rishia)<br/>
Rishia’s scream of terror fades into the distance.<br/>
"Now then…" (Naofumi)<br/>
I put on a cloak and leave the tent.<br/>
There are some other places I need to stop too.<br/>
<br/>
