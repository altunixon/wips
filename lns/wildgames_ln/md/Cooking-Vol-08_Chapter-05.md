PSA: Unappetizing stuff is mentioned during the offal preparation, so if you are eating, you might want to stop before reading on.<br/>
<br/>
1<br/>
The next day after Lala Wu’s thirteenth birthday, 26th of the Blue month.<br/>
I was working hard at preparing the food for the stall when Ai Fa returned home with a kiba on her shoulder.<br/>
「Uwah, you caught another kiba. Amazing, you haven’t been back even ten days, and this is already the third one?」<br/>
「Hmmp. But this is a young kiba, and its tusks and horns can only fetch two copper plates each.」<br/>
It might be young, but it was definitely over 40 kg. Besides, even though the kiba was petite, it was really plump and had plenty of fats.<br/>
Ai Fa greeted the women from the Fou and Dean houses who looked at her with admiration, walked to the space in front of the stove, and strung up the kiba on the tree branches. While doing that, she said to Gilulu who was tied to the tree nearby:<br/>
「Gilulu, I’m home.」<br/>
It sure was peaceful.<br/>
We would be meeting with the people from the Genos castle four days later. How long would such a peaceful life continue?<br/>
As I was thinking about this, an elderly lady suddenly said in awe:<br/>
「Ahh, that’s done really well.」<br/>
I turned and saw Tulu Dean shifting a grilled poitan onto a plate. Their poitan didn’t have any Gigo, but it still turned out soft and fluffy. The light-caramel-colored surface made it look really appetizing.<br/>
「That’s great, Tulu Dean. You have a talent for this.」<br/>
「No…」<br/>
Tulu Dean lowered her head. Her expression didn’t change much, but the way she was blushing a little looked really cute.<br/>
This girl used to live in the Tsun clan branch house. She had long brown hair that was tied into two ponytails at her neck. Her eyes were blue, and her cute features were filled with melancholy and a little bit of lifelessness.<br/>
The Tsun clan village was bond by strange rules in the past, which made the girl timid. She would show an angelic smile from time to time, and I could feel her gentle personality from her minute gestures. If she had grown up in a normal environment, she might be as lively as Rimee Wu. I couldn’t help thinking about that.<br/>
「Tulu Dean, your technique in grilling poitan is great. Bring some kiba meat with you next time, I will teach you how to cook a meat dish.」<br/>
When she heard me say that, Tulu Dean’s face turned redder, and she said squirmishly:<br/>
「But…」<br/>
「Asuta of the Fa house, according to the rules of Forest’s Edge, we should cook dinner using our own stove. We already grill our poitan here; if we even prepare our meat here, it would be an affront to the rules of Forest’s Edge.」<br/>
Jass Dean, the elder sister of the Dean house head and also the elder sister of Tulu Dean’s late mother, butted in. She was a middle-aged woman with a gentle face and stern eyes.<br/>
「Ah, that’s right, there’s such a rule. So aside from the poitan, everyone learned to cook the other ingredients through observation… But it’s hard to learn the skill by just watching alone.」<br/>
「That’s true. But Tulu Dean was taught before by you during the house head conference, so her hearth tending skill is outstanding.」<br/>
Tulu Dean’s hung her head even lower when she heard these compliments. Her attitude made me feel awkward too, it seemed that she lost her immunity towards kindness and goodwill.<br/>
「Ah…」<br/>
Tulu Dean gasped quietly.<br/>
I followed her gaze and saw Ai Fa eviscerating the skinned kiba.<br/>
「What’s the matter?」<br/>
I tried asking, but her only reply was: 「It’s nothing…」<br/>
The Tsun clan village avoided hunting whenever possible and ate the torso of the kiba. In that case, they probably ate the offal of the kiba too.[12]<br/>
「Offal, huh. There is a beast similar to kiba in my hometown too, and its offal tastes good. I wonder what the offal of a kiba tastes like.」<br/>
The thought of our conversation ending like that felt like a pity, so I continued talking. At this moment, Tulu Dean turned and look at me in surprise.<br/>
「A-Asuta, do you eat kiba offal in your hometown too?」<br/>
「Hmm? Not kiba, but an animal similar to it. The meat of both animals tastes the same, so I thought that kiba offal might be tasty too.」<br/>
「Y-You can eat offal!」<br/>
It was rare seeing this shy girl shouting. She blushed and hung her head low.<br/>
Jass Dean and the Fou house women stood stiffly in surprise.<br/>
「Ah, did the Tsun clan village even eat kiba offal?」<br/>
「… Yes.」<br/>
Her voice was whimsical.<br/>
「So you did eat kiba offal. The offal doesn’t look tasty, so the Tsun clan members hate hunting so much.」<br/>
Jass Dean looked at Tulu Dean sternly.<br/>
「No, in my hometown, the offal of animals is a delicacy, an important ingredient for us. Besides, the offal contain different nutrients from meat, which is another reason why we hold it in high regards.」<br/>
Half the reason why I spoke was for the sake of Tulu Dean, and the other half was because of my curiosity towards offal dishes.<br/>
「To be honest, I felt it was a pity whenever we discarded all the kiba offal. Tulu Dean, can you tell me how did you cook kiba offal?」<br/>
「Ehh…」<br/>
Tulu Dean felt troubled, and her eyes were wavering.<br/>
Jass Dean sighed softly and knocked Tulu Dean’s head gently.<br/>
「Asuta of the Fa house has shown you great kindness, right? This might be a trivial matter, but you should do whatever you can to help him.」<br/>
「… I understand.」<br/>
Tulu Dean nodded, and she raised her gaze towards me.<br/>
If I wasn’t mistaken, there was a gleam of happiness in her blue eyes just now.<br/>
<br/>
「I don’t know any complicated techniques, I only know we should remove the parts that are too stinky and then wash the offal with water.」<br/>
We followed Tulu Dean’s instructions and headed to the water source.<br/>
We put all the offals into a pot and then carried the heavy pot to the water source. Jass Dean and the seemingly uninterested women from the Fou house also followed; there were five of us in total. Ai Fa was busy dismembering the meat and didn’t participate.<br/>
「First, we need to discard this part.」<br/>
Tulu Dean grabbed a lump from the pot.<br/>
It was spherical and about the size of a ping-pong ball. The color looked nasty, so this was probably the bladder.<br/>
「And this part of this organ.」<br/>
She grabbed a heavy red lump— the liver. We had to get rid of a small greenish-yellow bag on it— the gallbladder.<br/>
If the bladder or gallbladder broke, a strong stench would get on the meat, so we had to be very careful when removing the organs. The hunters from the past taught me the same thing too.<br/>
「When a kiba is pregnant, this part needs to be thrown away, but this kiba is fine.」<br/>
It was a white and curvy organ, and after hearing her explanation, this might be the uterus. This was a female kiba.<br/>
「I see. Then let’s wash it with water. Where should we start?」<br/>
「Ah, before washing it, we need to cut the surface of these two organs and remove the filth.」<br/>
These two organs… One was a narrow white organ connected to the pink and curvy large intestines and was filled with wrinkles— it’s probably the rectum. The other was a large bloated pink object— the stomach.<br/>
I see; this kiba was fat, so it must have eaten a lot of Forest’s grace when it still lived. We had to remove the contents of its stomach.<br/>
The rectum was connected to the anus, so it should be full of shit. We were still newbies in terms of preparing the offal; compared to the filth in the rectum, the possible contents of the stomach made me more uncomfortable.<br/>
「Erm… Kiba not only eat fruits and greeneries, but also snakes, lizards, and worm, correct?」<br/>
When she heard me said that, Tulu Dean tilted her head quizzically.<br/>
「Yes… Speaking of which, we once found snakes inside when we cut this open.」<br/>
「Uwah, so I’m right!」<br/>
「But they were just snake carcasses though. There were some that were venomous, but they were dead, so it wasn’t dangerous.」<br/>
「You are right, but…」<br/>
「Asuta, are you scared of dead snakes?」<br/>
Tulu Dean giggled.<br/>
What an adorable smile.<br/>
「In that case, let me handle it. Asuta, can you lend me your knife?」<br/>
「No! If I’m afraid of the contents of the stomach, I won’t be able to cook offal in the future!」<br/>
I braced myself and pulled out a knife.<br/>
I stabbed the knife into the stomach, carefully cut it open, and, as expected, fruits and grass that had turned dark green appeared in the stomach.<br/>
「There aren’t any snakes, right?」<br/>
Tulu Dean cleared the filth in kiba’s rectum as she smiled brilliantly at me. She probably didn’t realize that she had been smiling all the while.<br/>
By the way, the kiba filth was like balls of karinto and didn’t feel dirty at all.[13] If I didn’t breathe through my nose, cleaning the filth or the contents of the stomach wasn’t tough at all.<br/>
Anyway, we successfully cleared the filth from the stomach and rectum.<br/>
We used the small stream flowing between the rocks to carefully clean the stomach and rectum and then worked on the long and curvy small and large intestines, followed by the uterus.<br/>
We washed the exterior of the thin intestines, cut it open, and then cleaned the inside and outside thoroughly. We got the other three ladies to help us with this phase.<br/>
It was best to clean away all the sticky fluids, but no matter how long we washed, we couldn’t get rid of them completely. The most efficient method was probably to wash it with salt, but salt wasn’t cheap in this world. So we had to overcome this problem with brute force through numbers.<br/>
「Alright, let’s use this chance to settle this part. Asuta, can you hold on to the front end and not let the water flow out?」<br/>
Tulu Dean gave clear instructions as she let in the water flowing between the rocks into the other end of the large intestines.<br/>
I blocked the other end as instructed, and the large intestine was filled with water, and the shape became like a large banana. Tulu Dean held on to the other end and scrubbed the entire length of the intestines.<br/>
She released the water, filled it again and repeated the procedure three times. She then used my knife and cut the large intestines into 10 cm chunks, turned them inside out, and scrubbed the exposed interior. Processing offal was tedious work.<br/>
When the five of us were finished with the large intestines, small intestines, and rectum, the beautiful pink and white chunks of meat were gathered in a small pile. In my mind, the offal had turned into an ingredient.<br/>
「Next will be this. Like the other organs, we will need to peel away this membrane first.」<br/>
Tulu Dean picked up a palm-sized, bean-shaped organ.<br/>
There were two with the same shape, and the organs that came in pairs were either lungs or kidney. This was probably the latter. I peeled off the membrane on the surface, and the reddish and smooth organs below got revealed.<br/>
「Asuta, can you cut it open from the side?」<br/>
「Understood.」<br/>
When I cut it open, white substance that was like fats flowed out.<br/>
「When we clean this organ, we would tear off this white part and dispose of it… It has some sort of stench.」<br/>
「I see.」<br/>
I remember the functions of a kidney was to filter the water in a body. So the poison inside a body was probably collected here.<br/>
I might not be familiar with offal, but I realized one thing. Tulu Dean probably liked tending to the hearth, that was why she had been showing such a happy face all the while.<br/>
The Tsun clan committed taboo by eating the grace of the forest, and it filled them with guilt. Their main house also ordered the branch house to 「hunt only the minimal number of kiba」, so they had to cook even the offal from the killed kiba.<br/>
Tulu Dean who was just ten must have known that the rules of the Tsun clan were abnormal. The main house probably reminded them time and time again to not let the other houses discover this fact, or they would be scalped. That was why their eyes were like dead fish.<br/>
Despite experiencing such a past, I thought Tulu Dean still loved hearth tending and was very proficient in this job. She even considered 「which parts to dispose of, in order to make a delicious meal」.<br/>
The denizens of Forest’s Edge lived such simple lives that they couldn’t permit the existence of delicious food. They thought that spending too much effort on cooking would be a waste, but some denizens still had the potential to cook a delicious meal.<br/>
In the Wu clan village, there already were proficient hearth caretakers; Leina Wu, Shela Wu, Mama Mia Lei and Tali Wu were all showing their talent in cooking. I thought Tulu Dean was the same type of person as them.<br/>
Although the hearth caretakers of the Tsun clan were closely related to the breaking of the taboo, they could manage the hearth in a correct manner now. This was probably the reason why they could smile so blissfully.<br/>
「There are two more organs. You can cut an opening here and wash away all the blood inside.」<br/>
Unaware of my thoughts, Tulu Dean took out the heart and liver.<br/>
「No matter how much we wash, there would still be blood inside. But it tastes better after washing…」<br/>
「You are right. This is why the men have to bloodlet the kiba after hunting them.」<br/>
During these eight decades, the denizens of Forest’s Edge had never thought about bloodletting. However, when the twisted rules of the Tsun clan forced them to consume offal which had a stronger stench than meat, they got closer to the truth that 「blood is the reason behind the stench」 in their pursuit to get rid of the smell. How ironic.<br/>
As I was thinking about that, I held the heart and Tulu Dean held the liver as we washed these organs in the stream and scrubbed them.<br/>
「The other parts can be washed with just water. We will fill the pot with water and rinse the organs there.」<br/>
Despite her words, there weren’t many organs left in the pot.<br/>
The lungs were in a light shade of pink, and the soft texture was incredible. There was also a long and thin organ covered in white fats. Through elimination, I guessed that was the pancreas. There was also a flat piece of meat, which was probably the diaphragm. I let Jass Dean and the others clean those organs.<br/>
「Well, that’s quite a lot of work… Tulu Dean, how do you eat these offals?」<br/>
「We usually boil them. But the offal has a stronger stench than the meat. So, we would boil it together with lilo and an unknown herb…」<br/>
Tulu Dean’s face turned gloomy. The denizens of Forest’s Edge probably didn’t know the name of this herb, since it was part of the grace of the forest they were forbidden to eat.<br/>
「You will only boil it? What about grilling them?」<br/>
「Ehh…? Yes… Grilling the offals won’t remove the stench…」<br/>
「I see. But you are fine with offal, right?」<br/>
If she hated offal, she wouldn’t go out of her way to declare that she had eaten it before. I didn’t think she would bring up the twisted practices of the Tsun clan if she could help it.<br/>
「Yes… I don’t particularly dislike offal in the past. How should I put it… I like the nommy texture of offal.」[14]<br/>
「Nommy, what an interesting way of describing it.」<br/>
I intentionally answered cheerfully, and Tulu Dean’s stern face turned red immediately as she lowered her head.<br/>
I felt a little bad about it, but this was better than letting her think about the past.<br/>
「Well then, I will let you try my way of cooking it. Don’t worry, the nommy texture will still be there.」<br/>
After saying that joke, Tulu Dean who was washing the liver made angry tsundere noises and shouted 「Enough already!」, and then bumped my chest with her shoulder.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>

After washing the offal, we returned to the Fa house and got back to our work for the time being.<br/>
That wasn’t because we were putting the offal on hold. I soaked the heart and liver in salt water and continued letting out its blood. Next, we added lilo into a pot of water and then lightly boiled the other offal. They were then added into marinating sauce made from myam, aria, and fruit wine.<br/>
After spending an hour to prepare the offal, my preparation for the tomorrow was delayed a lot. I quickly kneaded the patty of the "Kiba burger", sliced the meat for the "Myam-roasted meat", "Kiba braised meat" and "Kiba chitto", and finally finished my daily chores before dusk.<br/>
「Alright, let’s start cooking the offal.」<br/>
We walked to the two outdoor stoves. One of them was used to cook the soup for dinner, and the other was preheating the griddle.<br/>
「Huh? Are you going to grill the offal?」<br/>
Tulu Dean opened her eyes wide in disbelief, and I nodded in return:<br/>
「That’s right, with the seasoning available to the Fa house, grilling it will make it tastier. I will grill it with marinating sauce, similar to this "Myam-roasted meat".」<br/>
「You already boiled it just now, and you want to fry it again…」<br/>
The denizens of Forest’s Edge didn’t have the concept of pre-boiling food and seasoning them for grilling. They were surprised to see me do that. In my old world, the pork intestines used in Horumonyaki would be pre-boiled before it was cooked.[15]<br/>
Expression 「I thought」 probably sounded unreliable, but my family seldom ate out, so just like shabu-shabu, I seldom got the chance to try offal dishes.[16]<br/>
My dad was probably uninterested in offal dishes. Whenever a regular customer suggested adding offal hotpot to the menu, he always replied: 「Maybe next time」.<br/>
Hence, I had to figure out the technique for cooking offal by myself. I didn’t pre-boil the heart, liver and kidney, and just sliced them thinly before soaking them in the myam marinating sauce. The heart was called Hatsu, the liver was called Reba… What was kidney called again? I would probably never know.<br/>
The other offal were pre-boiled and cut into large chunks. They looked just like the pig offal I remembered from my old world. I decided to challenge the other offal next. I grabbed the offal dipped in red sauce and then tossed generous portions of it into the pot. The sweet aroma of the fruit wine and the garlic-like fragrance of the myam spread out in a burst of white smoke.<br/>
「Uwah, smells nice.」<br/>
The Fou house women muttered happily.<br/>
「Asuta, thanks to you buying jerky from the Fou house, we have many copper plates to spare. We will try buying myam next time too.」<br/>
「That’s wonderful.」<br/>
I continued using the spatula as I answered, careful to not let the offal burn. At this moment, Ai Fa poked her head over my shoulder.<br/>
「Hmm, that looks weird.」<br/>
「But it smells good, right?」<br/>
「Isn’t that the smell of myam?」<br/>
She was right.<br/>
How should I put this? Would the grilled kiba offal suit the taste of the denizens of Forest’s Edge? When preparation work was complete, the marinating sauce did its job and masked any lingering stench, so everyone should find it palatable. But I didn’t eat grilled offal too many times before, so I felt a little uneasy.<br/>
「Alright, the first battle is upon us.」<br/>
I pushed the cooked offal to the edge of the griddle.<br/>
I then scooped them onto a plate with a spatula and handed it to Tulu Dean.<br/>
「Please have some. We are the ones who suggested cooking the offal, so we should taste it first.」<br/>
「… Alright.」<br/>
Tulu Dean took the plate with an uneasy expression. If it didn’t taste good, the work for the past hour would be wasted…<br/>
That was probably what she thought.<br/>
We should take responsibility together. I put some of the offal on my plate and shoved it into my mouth without hesitation.<br/>
The familiar sweet and tangy taste of the "Myam-roasted meat" spread in my mouth.<br/>
Next, I started chewing the offal, and the nommy texture Tulu Dean mentioned really soothed the mind. The texture of the offal felt like chicken skin, very chewy and hard to tear apart.<br/>
It wasn’t bad.<br/>
There wasn’t any stench.<br/>
By the way, which part did I just eat? It wasn’t thick, so it should be the intestine or rectum. The dish felt average to me.<br/>
「Tulu Dean, how is it?」<br/>
I shifted my gaze towards her.<br/>
Tulu Dean held the plate and spoon, and showed a blissful smile:<br/>
「It’s very delicious… much better than the offal I ate in the past.」<br/>
I see.<br/>
Offal possessed a subjective taste, and everyone had their own preference. As I thought about that, I ate a large piece of offal. I kept chewing it, and a different taste spread in my mouth.<br/>
「Hmm? It tastes really good.」<br/>
「Isn’t that right? It’s delicious, huh?」<br/>
Tulu Dean’s smile broadened.<br/>
Why was that? I liked the chewy texture of this offal. The taste was more prominent than earlier, and I could feel the unique taste of kiba fat in this.<br/>
From its shape, I was probably eating a large intestine. It was amazingly delicious.<br/>
「Yes, it’s good. I can recommend this dish with confidence. Everyone, please try it too.」<br/>
As the amount was limited, I gave each house one plate of offal. The women from the Fou house took it timidly, while Tulu Dean filled another plate and handed it to Jass Dean with a smile.<br/>
I also offered my plate to my house head.<br/>
「… Is it really good?」<br/>
「It’s tasty. Well~, the taste of each part is different, but after trying some, you will find one that is exceptionally good.」<br/>
As I answered, I started grilling the heart and liver.<br/>
The liver looked exactly like a pig liver, so did the kidney and heart. The heart was much leaner though and looked closer to being lean meat.<br/>
While I was grilling the offal, I stole a glance at Ai Fa.<br/>
「How is it? It’s good, right?」<br/>
「Well, it’s not bad… But when can I swallow it?」<br/>
「To be frank, I don’t know either. Just chew it up adequately, I guess?」<br/>
As we were speaking, the heart and liver were done.<br/>
I tried fried pork liver with chives and chicken liver kebab before, but I wondered how this dish would taste. While Ai Fa was still chewing, I took the plate from her hand, scooped up the food in the griddle, and then tried the liver.<br/>
Hmm, yummy.<br/>
The taste of kiba liver was stronger than the chicken and pork liver I tried, but there wasn’t any blood stench. We didn’t prepare it too thoroughly, and the taste was very outstanding, which meant this was fine as a dish. I had never cooked offal before and had always tossed them away. I regretted doing that now.<br/>
The kidney had a similar texture to the liver. Even though the taste wasn’t as strong as the liver, the taste was smoother and the texture softer.<br/>
Next was the heart… It was no different from normal meat. The heart looked like grilled lean meat, but more tender than thigh meat.<br/>
「Hmm; tastes great and is easier to swallow than the other offal. Ai Fa, want to try some?」<br/>
「What is this? Isn’t it meat?」<br/>
「This is liver, that’s a kidney, and over here is the heart. The liver’s taste is more unique, but it’s full of nutrition. The heart is as delicious as normal meat.」<br/>
「The heart of a kiba…」<br/>
Ai Fa muttered a little uneasily and then tried the heart first.<br/>
「… It’s delicious.」<br/>
「Aren’t I right?」<br/>
「Yes, it’s delicious… Not just that, I can feel very strongly that I had consumed the life of a kiba.」<br/>
Ai Fa seemed satisfied.<br/>
The others showed similar expressions.<br/>
And so, the six of us swiftly finished the samples. The rest of the offal would be the Fa house’s dinner tonight.<br/>
The sampling session before dinner ended smoothly.<br/>
「How delicious… But the preparation is too tedious, right? The legs and torso meat are just as delicious, but they are much easier to prepare.」<br/>
After the sampling session was over, Jass Dean told me her thoughts on behalf of the women.<br/>
「That’s right, I think each house should decide for themselves whether they want to eat offal. The intestines are more troublesome to prepare, so eating just the heart and liver is another way… Tulu Dean, even if we cover the offal with Pico leaves, we can’t preserve it for long, correct?」<br/>
「Yes. It can be kept for a few days, but we always finished it on the first day.」<br/>
「As I expected. If time permits, the Fa house will eat all the offal. Since we learned how delicious offal is, I can’t bear discarding them, furthermore… When we sell meat in the Post Station Town, the price of the meat will increase too.」<br/>
Jass Dean and the others tilted their head puzzledly.<br/>
「Just a small kiba can cook such a large quantity of food, so a larger kiba will be able to provide one dinner for a family, right? After squeezing out one dinner, the excess meat can then be sold… Never mind, please don’t worry too much about earning copper plates.」<br/>
「I see… that’s true…」<br/>
「Another thing, offal can only be eaten on the day the kiba is hunted. From that perspective, it is a meal presented to the hunters as a blessing for their bountiful harvest. That’s the reason why I kept these parts to make these dishes.」<br/>
The thinking for everyone was different, so I didn’t plan to force my ideals on others.<br/>
「If there are no urgent matters, spending a bit more effort isn’t a bad thing. The offal also contains different types of nutrients from normal meat, since their texture is different from them too.」<br/>
「… I think the men will like kiba heart.」<br/>
Ai Fa said quietly.<br/>
「That must be food that hunters like. When I ate the heart, it felt as if the lifeforce of the kiba was flowing into my body, it felt really satisfying.」<br/>
「I see. Asuta of the Fa house, thank you for teaching us so much.」<br/>
Jass Dean said.<br/>
Jass Dean’s eyes might look stern, but she had a gentle expression on her face. She put her wrinkled hand on top of Tulu Dean’s head.<br/>
「The Dean house will cook offal in the future too. After all, Tulu Dean likes to eat it.」<br/>
Tulu Dean smiled with her face slightly red.<br/>
「The nommy taste is really good, right?」<br/>
「Enough already!」<br/>
I butted in, and Tulu Dean’s face turned even redder as she kept pounding my chest.<br/>
Under the icy glare of my house head, night slowly fell in the Forest’s Edge.<br/>
