    <p>Thank you, everyone, for purchasing the tenth volume of 『Cooking with Wild Game』.</p>

    <p>The series has finally reached its tenth installment. I’m very proud of the number of volumes reaching double digits.</p>

    <p>This is only due to everyone who accompanied me all this way. I’m bad in expressing myself, but I still wish to give my most sincere thanks to everyone.</p>

    <p>The ones on the cover of this memorable volume are the men of the Wu clan. I’m very moved by this, as the fearsome Papa Donda Wu has never been featured on the cover before.</p>

    <p><a id="ftnref11"></a>On the side note, the mid-meal snack is also about the Wu clan, in line with the cover. The illustration on the inside cover is so cute. It is told from the perspective of the mischievous youngest son Ludo Wu. Please look forward to it.<a epub:type="noteref" href="../Text/Notes.xhtml#ftn11">[11]</a></p>

    <p><a id="ftnref12"></a>Next will be some idle chatter. At the end of the volume is an advertisement for my work that is being published in Kadokawa.<a epub:type="noteref" href="../Text/Notes.xhtml#ftn12">[12]</a> I will be happy if you support me in that series as well.</p>

    <p>The afterword is just two pages this time, so I have to keep things brief.</p>

    <p>I will conclude, as usual, by thanking my editor from HOBBY JAPAN, the illustrator Kochimo-sensei, all the staff who helped in the publishing of this volume, and all the readers who read this boo;, I’m very grateful to everyone.</p>

    <p>Let’s meet again in the next volume!</p>

    <p>February 2017, EDA</p>
