Arifureta After III   Tortus Travel Journal ①<br/>
<br/>
At that time, when the "returnee" uproar was calming down, on a certain day where there would be consecutive holidays in a few more days.<br/>
In the living room of his home, Hajime was encountering an extremely troubling situation.<br/>
「If you want to pass through here, then step over your mother’s dead body.」<br/>
「……」<br/>
His mother Sumire was standing in his way while repeatedly jumping sideways, for some reason.<br/>
Her gaze was sharp, and her movement was agile. She was muttering 「kabaddi kabaddi kabaddi」 with a small voice……it seemed that it wasn’t sideways leaping, but she was imitating India’s sport.<br/>
It was completely mysterious that, for some reason, his mother challenged him with an Indian sport even though he was only trying to go to the kitchen to get something to drink.<br/>
And then, speaking of a mystery,<br/>
「Hajime. Tou-san will cry if you don’t start showing any kind of reaction soon, you know?」<br/>
Surely it also applied to the father――Shuu――standing behind him in a Joj○ pose that looked relatively painful. (TN: Jojo pose)<br/>
In other words, currently, Hajime, who was trying to take a drink from the kitchen, was being surrounded by his mother who was doing kabaddi and his father who is standing in a Joj○ pose, for some reason.<br/>
Hajime let out a long sigh.<br/>
「I don’t want to say something like this to my parents, but……I’ll dare to say it. ――Seriously annoying.」<br/>
「Myy, how can you say that to your father! Just because he is a bit like that, it’s cruel! Apologize!」<br/>
「Oii, how can you say that to your mother! Just because she is a bit like that, that’s cruel! Apologize!」<br/>
Sumire and Shuu looked at each other. It seemed they both thought that Hajime’s words were directed to the other one. It never crossed their mind that those words could be for themselves.<br/>
「Wait a second dear. Just what is annoying from me? He referred to the father who is standing in a Joj○ pose in the living room, you know? In this world, there are no humans more annoying than you right now.」<br/>
「Ha? I don’t get what you mean though? Is there something more annoying than a mother who is doing kabaddi inside the house? Stop running from reality, Sumire.」<br/>
A beat. 「Aa?」「Oo?」 They both pressed on each other. The Nagumo family’s married couple were glaring at each other while sandwiching their son in between.<br/>
Hajime was massaging his forehead to endure the headache from the outbreak of this incomprehensible matrimonial quarrel.<br/>
「Anyway, leave aside the matrimonial quarrel for now. Can you say just what in the world you two were planning to do?」<br/>
Sumire and Shuu who were glaring at each other returned to their original positions with a jump *hyupa-*, and then with good coordination that would make one wonder just what with the dangerous atmosphere before this, they spoke their desire.<br/>
「「We want to go to another world and travel!!」」<br/>
Sumire and Shuu’s eyes were sparkling. It seemed they wanted to go to Tortus. There would be consecutive holidays soon, so they must be wanting to go on a family trip. And they were requesting for the destination to be another world.<br/>
「……Tortus huh. My bad, but is it no good to postpone it for a bit later? It’s not that we cannot go, but it will make my plans get disordered greatly.」<br/>
There was a method to go to Tortus. The method was simple. If there was the compass and Crystal Key, they could go anywhere.<br/>
Although, it wasn’t like there was no problem at all. It was the fuel. Even calling the amount of energy needed to travel between worlds as enormous was still underselling it; an absurd amount of magic power would be necessary. They couldn’t travel that easily.<br/>
For now, there was a stockpile of magic power that qualified as just barely enough. There was enough, but there was a set schedule to use it until Hajime could establish a method to travel easily and freely to another world. He hesitated to use it merely just to go play.<br/>
Hajime was looking reluctant; however, Sumire and Shuu showed a complacent smile as though wanting to say 「That reaction is just as expected」.<br/>
And then, they signaled by whistling in front of the dubious Hajime. By the way, Sumire couldn’t whistle, so she was saying 「Pyuuu」.<br/>
Right after the whistling echoed inside the Nagumo house, multiple silhouettes appeared in the living room. It was a method of teleportation that requires the use of gate――"Divine Existence".<br/>
Naturally, the ones that appeared were Yue, followed by Myuu, Remia, Shia, and Tio who seemed to be teleported by Yue. Yue and co then began moving with a smooth movement that was like a trained troupe.<br/>
「A-no-ther-world! Want-to-go! A-no-ther-world! Want-to-go!」<br/>
While Sumire started to take the lead, at the front Myuu, Yue, Remia, and then Sumire were lining up vertically in that order and began doing the Choo Choo ○rain. (TN: Choo Choo Train, google it)<br/>
Myuu was laughing while doing her best to move her small body in a big circle. Yue was depicting a circle with slightly delayed movements. She was expressionless, but she looked like she was having fun somewhat. Remia too was chuckling「Ufufu ♡」 while following their movement splendidly.<br/>
Hajime thought ‘These guys, they absolutely practiced this.’ At the same time, the face of his mother who was pleading to travel to another world with a triumphant look made him irritated somehow.<br/>
「That’s right!」<br/>
「To another woorld!」<br/>
「Let’s go! Desuu!」<br/>
When he looked back, Tio, Shuu, and Shia were lining up horizontally while making chuuni poses. Their pose was a Joj○ pose that came from accumulating research on top of research.<br/>
In the front was his mother’s gang who was perfectly reproducing a revolving dance that was leaving an impression in the heart somehow even though its formal name still wasn’t clear despite the dance’s fame while at the back was his father’s gang who was doing perfect chuuni poses that were also impossible to forget.<br/>
「I waaant to see my son’s cool side juust for a biit~♪」<br/>
「It was my dream to get my son to take me on a trip you knooow~. I wish my son will fulfill his filial piety~」<br/>
The mother and father were whining with their all.<br/>
Hajime’s forehead massage was getting more intense.<br/>
When he was holding his head at his wits’ end toward the eccentricity that was under the name of parents’ pestering, Yue, who was expressionlessly twirling, opened her mouth.<br/>
「……Hajime. It’s important to do what should be done, but family service is also important.」<br/>
「Yue……」<br/>
A telepathic message suddenly arrived from Yue.<br/>
"……Besides, Okaa-samamother-in-law and Otou-samafather-in-law want to know of the road that Hajime walked on. This isn’t simply curiosity, but because this is about their treasured son."<br/>
"……"<br/>
"……I understand. Hajime doesn’t really want Okaa-sama and Otou-sama to know about what Hajime did. Isn’t that right?"<br/>
"……You’re right. I think it’s something they don’t need to know."<br/>
"……Okaa-sama and Otou-sama also understand that Hajime is thinking like that. But, exactly because of that, they want to know. In order to convey that they can still embrace Hajime with their feelings like now even after knowing."<br/>
Hajime looked up.<br/>
Tortus was an important place where he met Yue and the others. There was no way he was avoiding it.<br/>
But, at the same time, that world was also hell for Hajime. What he did to escape and return home, should be considered as gruesome on Earth.<br/>
He didn’t have the slightest bit of regret, and if it was necessary, he would do the same thing even now.<br/>
Although he had already told his parents about what he had done, even Hajime would hesitate to make his father and mother to expressly follow his footsteps and make them feel it for real.<br/>
For example, even if he was convinced that how his parents were looking at him wouldn’t change from it, as a son, he felt a sense of hesitation that couldn’t be explained with logic.<br/>
The travel to another world had been done several times, but he had never brought Shuu and Sumire together on those occasions due to the manifestation of such thinking.<br/>
Seeing that Hajime was indecisive, Yue spoke encouragingly at him while still doing the twirling dance.<br/>
"……I also want to know. With what kind of feelings, what kind of hardship you overcame, in order for Hajime to return back to Okaa-sama and Otou-sama. The two of them have the right to know. Hajime, answer them."<br/>
「……If Yue speaks that much, then I cannot escape anymore huh?」<br/>
That’s right, escape. It was unlike Hajime to do that.<br/>
Hajime smiled self-depreciatingly, and his shoulders that were tensed unconsciously relaxed.<br/>
「Haa. I got it. Kaa-san, Tou-san, I’ll invite you two to Tortus on the coming holidays, so stop doing the Choo Choo Trai○ and Joj○ poses inside the house already.」<br/>
Immediately, 「Wa~i!」 Sumire and Shuu raised both their hands joyfully. They jumped for joy while high fiving each other.<br/>
Their frolicking caused Hajime to spontaneously want to tsukkomiretort 「Are you two children!」. That was how happy they were to be able to know about what Hajime went through in another world.<br/>
「We did it dear! With this, we can see a lot of animal ears as much as we want!」<br/>
「Oi oi, Sumire. Don’t forget about elves in the flesh! We’ve got to see the pointed ears twitching even at the risk of our life!」<br/>
「That’s obvious! Especially the girls! Gufufuh, I really cannot wait to see erlves in the flesh it’s painful……」(TN: In Japan, elf is read as erufu, with the ‘r’ sounds like ‘l’. Here Sumire switched the ‘u’ in the middle with ‘o’, into erofu. When Japanese people read it, it will still sound like elf, but the ero here refers to erotic.)<br/>
「That’s it!」<br/>
Hajime turned his gaze to Yue.<br/>
「What did you say about following my footsteps?」<br/>
「……O, of course, they also want to know about that, should be……」<br/>
Yue’s gaze was fiercely swimming around. Seeing how the two were merrily frolicking while chanting 「Erlf! Erlf in the flesh!」, no matter how anyone looked at it, no parental feeling of wanting to know the son’s experience could be seen at all. Rather, their own interest and desire was bared to see.<br/>
There, someone pulled *kui kui* at Hajime’s hand……<br/>
「Papa. Whaaat is erlf?」<br/>
Myuu’s pure question. Her eyes were shining with curiosity. There was no way he could teach her the meaning of the words of the two dirty adults. Those pure eyes made Hajime feel like that.<br/>
Hajime was directing a nihilistic gaze toward Sumire and Shuu.<br/>
「Myuu. There are things in this world that shouldn’t be known.」<br/>
「??」<br/>
He answered like that.<br/>
–<br/>
–<br/>
–<br/>
In the morning of the holiday.<br/>
A lot of people were inside the Nagumo home’s living room.<br/>
「Kaori? My angel? Won’t you get back into a good mood soon? Look, somehow Otou-san is also coming like this. Okay?」<br/>
「……」<br/>
On the living room’s sofa was the figure of Kaori whose, although she was sitting demurely in an upright gesture with both her legs sticking close to each other and her hands placed on her knees, expression wasn’t even trying to hide her sullenness.<br/>
Toward such a Kaori――the one who was desperately cheering up his beloved daughter was Shirasaki Tomoichi.<br/>
「Kaori, Oji-sanuncle is seriously depressed, so how about leaving it at that?」<br/>
The one who was smiling wryly beside Kaori while intermediating was Shizuku.<br/>
「Tomoichi-kun too is receiving hardships from his daughter huh.」<br/>
「……Otou-san? What does that mean? Rather, I believe the one receiving a hardship here is me who found out about my family’s hidden occupation and outrageous behavioral principles though?」<br/>
「……I stirred up the hornet’s nest.」<br/>
The one who sent sympathetic words to Tomoichi and got rewarded with a reproachful gaze from Shizuku was Yaegashi Koichi who averted his eyes. Beside Koichi, the one who similarly averted his eyes was the grandfather Yaegashi Shuuzou.<br/>
「Fufu, Tomoichi-san and Kaori-chan are really close.」<br/>
「……It’s always embarrassing every time it happens, Kirino-san.」<br/>
There were two ladies leisurely watching the father-daughter quarrels while drinking tea at the living room’s table. One was Yaegashi Kirino, and the other one was Shirasaki Kaoruko. They were respectively the mother of Shizuku and Kaori.<br/>
Hearing the talk of the Nagumo family going to Tortus for a trip during this consecutive holiday, Kaori and Shizuku pleaded ‘In that case, we too!’. The result was the families of both households gathering like this in the living room of the Nagumo house.<br/>
Unfortunately, the families outside of these two families weren’t able to take consecutive holidays. One other family would be the exception and passed off in this time.<br/>
In order to bring along that last fellow traveler to this Tortus travel group, currently, Hajime wasn’t in the Nagumo house. The people here were waiting for his return.<br/>
Actually, Kaoruko was a great fan of Sumire’s shoujo mangagirl comic, and Kirino, who didn’t know about the manga itself but knew about the live-action film, knew about Sumire’s true identity as the author. Their nervousness was rising, and they were also getting excited talking with Remia and Myuu who joined in the conversation about the mother-daughter’s story of the fishman tribe.<br/>
Shuu was making fun of Tomoichi; Tomoichi snapped and assaulted Shuu……<br/>
Yue was making fun of Kaori; Kaori snapped and assaulted Yue……<br/>
Shia coaxed Shuuzou and Koichi that she wished to be shown the technique of the Yaegashi-style (hidden), then the two displayed outrageous ninjut――ancient martial arts technique in the garden……<br/>
On that garden’s tree, a regrettable dragon who blundered early in the morning was being hung down wrapped in a bamboo mat……<br/>
The neighbors who saw the garden of the Nagumo house while passing through then used hurried footsteps……<br/>
The gossip among the neighbors that the Nagumo house was the haunted house of the residential area was accelerating……<br/>
They killed time like that for a while.<br/>
Suddenly, the space in the living room began to distort like jelly. It was proof of space teleportation using "gate".<br/>
As expected, a round hole that allowed a person to pass through was expanding.<br/>
「That bastard, he obviously has a lingering attachment. As I thought, perhaps I should create a scene of the Inugami house once to him properly?」 (TN: Inugami house is something like a murder story or something in Japan I think.)<br/>
「That’s why I’m saying, why is Hajime-kun so fixated with the Inugami house?」<br/>
「Taichi-kun also receives a lot of hardships, doesn’t he? More importantly, it’s really like the Anywhe○ Door. How amazing~」<br/>
The one who entered was Hajime and Aiko, and then Aiko’s mother, Akiko.<br/>
It would be Akiko alone who joined them from the Hatayama family. The other family members couldn’t leave their farm even temporarily, and this time they would pass up the opportunity. They would participate another time when the travel between worlds became easier.<br/>
Hajime who crossed through space while talking about something saw the two fathers and the two wives scuffling before his eyes, and then he saw the Yaegashi family displaying things like KatonFire Style or KawarimiSubstitute Technique in the garden, then he saw the four madams chatting and giggling while feeding Myuu, and said a short sentence.<br/>
「Eh? What’s with this chaos?」<br/>
Even though he only left them for thirty minutes, for some reason, he was shown a great commotion inside the house. His expression cramped.<br/>
And then, he saw the Hatayama mother and daughter whose eyes opened wide.<br/>
「Aiko’s home is really peacefully nice huh. I really like the Hatayama family you see~」<br/>
「Hee!? I, is that so? Ehehe~」<br/>
「My, Hajime-kun you flatterer, saying happy things like that. Come again to play in the future. Our house’s fruits are the best thanks to Aiko, you know?」<br/>
「Yes. I will come at that time without fail.」<br/>
Hajime and the Hatayama mother and daughter conversed peacefully.<br/>
Under their feet, there was still a great ruckus. 「Speaking of the cause, it’s the son of you bastard!」「Ha-ha-ha! Tomo-kun, your heart is really narrow huh~. This is why recently Kaori-chan is calling me "Otou-san" adoringly――」「Don’t say anymoreeeeee! I’m a bit aware of it after alllll-. Also, don’t call me Tomo-kunnn-」 The father of the Shirasaki family and the father of the Nagumo family were grappling like that.<br/>
Incidentally, beside them was「Muiiiiiiiih, Yue you idioooot」「Nniiiiih, Kaori you stupiiidd」 an exchange of cat punches and kicks.<br/>
Furthermore, 「Pa, papaaa! Save meee!」 Myuu, who was jostled and treated affectionately like a cat by the madam group, was reaching out her hand to him while gasping for breath. In the garden, Shia VS Shuuzou & Koichi was about to start as Shizuku was desperately attempting to stop them.<br/>
In the end, it would take an hour for everyone to calm down so they could depart.<br/>
–<br/>
–<br/>
–<br/>
Everyone was only bringing baggage in the amount that wouldn’t become a hindrance and moved to the underground of the Nagumo house.<br/>
The parents from each family were going「A really deep underground room is……」 in surprise. Tomoichi whose occupation was an architect was muttering something like「The Building Standards Law is……」.<br/>
Before long they could see the end of the stairs, but ahead of it a wall appeared, and the path ended.<br/>
While everyone’s attention gathered on Hajime wondering what to do, Hajime put his hand on a corner of the wall. Instantly, brilliant crimson light ran through the whole wall, and the wall split into two. 「Oo~」 Admiring voices were raised.<br/>
「The wall is created using magic called soul magic. If it’s not someone that Hajime-kun gives permission to, they absolutely won’t be able to enter inside. After all, the magic literally investigates the compatibility of the soul. Of course, I can enter inside!」<br/>
Kaori showed a triumphant look, especially toward her father. 「I’m trusted by Hajime-kun, you know!」 Such an implicit claim caused Tomoichi to display a "sullen face" that was exactly like his daughter before this.<br/>
But, in the next instant, he made a grand tsukkomi with his eyes snapping wide open.<br/>
「WAIT A SECOOOOOOOOND! This is obviously strange, isn’t it!? What’s with this size!?」<br/>
Yes, the underground space Hajime was proud of had the size a bit like a theatrical building. No matter how one looked at it, it was of the size that reached up to the other houses in the neighborhood and even under the main street.<br/>
As an architect who often got troubled by how to create as much as "size" as possible with limited space, surely this underground space that felt like it was saying 「I exist for the sake of crushing the Building Standards Law!」「The land of other people is mine. The land of the country is also mine」 couldn’t be tolerated no matter what.<br/>
This space that was as though it existed for the sake of making him, a first-class architect, want to say ‘Are you showing off this outrageous thing to me, huuuuh!?’ caused Tomoichi to send a glare toward Hajime. Hajime smiled wryly.<br/>
「I didn’t do anything that would make it troublesome to deal with if it’s exposed. I’m enlarging the underground space using a magic called space magic. You know about the Treasure Warehouse that Kaori has right? The principle is the same.」<br/>
「I, is that so……. Anything is really possible with magic huh……」<br/>
Tomoichi felt like the common sense of an architect was overturned right from the roots, and he looked up.<br/>
He barely ignored the overwhelming gaze of his angel beside him that was looking for agreement 「Hajime-kun is amazing, isn’t he? Right, right? Otou-san also thinks so, right?」. He was also doing his best to ignore the exasperated gaze of his wife who was looking at him acting like this.<br/>
「Hmmm. This is nice. When Tomoichi-kun yelled just now, his voice didn’t really echo. The walls and floor also look strong against impacts; it feels like we will be able to have some good training here without being a bother to the neighbors. And above all else, it’s making the heart dance just from the fact that it is underground.」<br/>
「Right. Hajime-kun. About this underground space, can you make it under the Yaegashi house too if we request it?」<br/>
「Otou-san!? Ojii-chanGrandfather!? You two are still planning to make our house into an even more outrageous residence!?」<br/>
The current house head and assistant instructor of the Yaegashi-style, who were repeatedly stepping on the floor and roughly striking the wall, were leaking out their admiration, envy, and desire all over. Together they also ignored the grieving voice 「Stooopp it!」 of the daughter who wanted them to stop.<br/>
「……If Shizuku is okay with it, I won’t be reluctant to be of help.」 (TN: A reminder, Hajime is using polite language all this time when he is talking with his wives’ family here. He is using casual language when talking with his own parents though.)<br/>
When Hajime was worrying whether it was all right to increase his lover’s hardship more than this while looking at Shizuku, Shizuku shook her head left and right in a display of 「Firm rejection!」.<br/>
「Hajime-san, I wonder if you would also receive a request for an individual underground space? I want to have a consultation about a space where only certain people can enter using soul magic though……」<br/>
「Okaa-san!?」<br/>
Shizuku had no ally. Kiriko’s gaze with her index finger touching her cheek and her head tilted, which strangely looked appropriate for her, was looking straight at Hajime.<br/>
Even while Hajime’s cheeks were cramping, for now, he put away the problems for the future by saying 「If there is a chance, I will be open for consultation.」.<br/>
Except for the father of a certain bug rabbit, Hajime was doing his utmost to be considerate to the speech and conduct of his wive~s’ family, so he hesitated to reject them down bluntly.<br/>
「Hmmmm, no matter how many times I hear it, the discomfort from seeing Goshujin-sama using polite language art still amazing.」<br/>
「Isn’t it~. A lot has happened since coming to Earth. I have also seen Hajime-san like this several times though.」<br/>
Tio and Shia were looking at Hajime with really complicated expressions. For the two of them, the demon king Hajime who was crushing absurdity with even more absurdity was exactly what Hajime was to them, so they only felt chills that made their body shiver, for some reason, after seeing his actions and speech that were considerate to other people.<br/>
Although this was the manifestation of Hajime’s feelings that was trying to treasure the entirety of his wive~s’ family, so they didn’t intend to stop him.<br/>
They advanced deeper into the underground space that was also Hajime’s "underground workshop". Here and there, things like transmutation material, or modern technological goods were placed. The golemsGrim Reapers that were in the process of being created were especially eye-catching.<br/>
Even Yue and the others, along with Sumire and Shuu, who were used to seeing them to a certain degree had their gazes wandering around restlessly in curiosity. While that was going on, Hajime pulled several books from a bookshelf that was safekeeping various materials.<br/>
Instantly, *gogogo-* a heavy sound resounded, and the bookshelves split left and right. The wall behind it had a metallic two-leaf door that was also solidly made.<br/>
Seeing that, it seemed Shuu had a question suddenly welling up inside, and he asked while tilting his head.<br/>
「Come to think of it Hajime. Why are you using that kind of door? If you have that crystal key something, you can connect the space from anywhere, right?」<br/>
It was a question that was only natural, which caused everyone’s gaze to gather on Hajime.<br/>
「Certainly that’s true. But this door is also an artifact more or less. It’s taking part in economizing the use of magic power. It erased the need to use magic power for designating or fixing the coordinate in place. Though it only has the effect of reducing the cost by twenty percent.」<br/>
「I see. If I remember right, the exit is fixed at the palace in the other world. Hahah, Tou-san completely thought that the reason you made this is only because this is cooler.」<br/>
Hajime slowly averted his gaze. Actually, eighty percent of his reason was that. Also, he secretly gave the name "World Door" to it.<br/>
Even though there was already a door that was locked using soul magic to enter the workshop, by the point he set up bookshelves to hide this it was beyond obvious that this was merely his hobby working in full.<br/>
The gazes of Yue and co, the wive~s, who guessed his reason, were lukewarm. Myuu’s praise of 「Papa! These bookshelves are cool nano!」 echoed inside his heart in a bad meaning. Sumire’s wide grin that seemed to say 「I understand, you know?」 was unbearable.<br/>
「A, anyway, I’ll open the door so back away a bit.」<br/>
Hajime took out the Crystal Key from his Treasure Warehouse, then put it inside the keyhole of the World Door that wasn’t particularly necessary. A crimson light that was particularly meaningless surged throughout the whole surface of the World Door, and a pattern that seemed really meaningful emerged, also without any particular meaning.<br/>
When even more magic power that was taken out from magic crystals in stock was poured in, before long, the World Door started to emit light that was overflowing with mystique and impact. Of course, the light was meaningless.<br/>
There, Yue and the others also joined in by pouring magic power in order to lighten Hajime’s burden. All of their magic power brilliantly illuminated the underground workshop.<br/>
Sumire and Shuu were watching in fascination at that sublime sight without even making a commotion with wide eyes. The other parents were even more so.<br/>
Before long, the magic power of Hajime and co that was a real cheat was completely taken by the Crystal Key and World Door. Finally, space connected to the other world, Tortus.<br/>
Hajime rotated the Crystal Key. *Click*, the heavy sound of a lock being released rang and the door opened. At the same time, *RINGOOOON!* a bell sound reverberated. This was the sound that notified the "gate opening" on the palace’s side.<br/>
Hajime’s crimson, Yue’s golden, Shia’s bluish white, Tio’s pure black, Kaori’s silver, Shizuku’s lapis lazuli, and Aiko’s cherry blossom, lights of seven colors overflowed. In front of the opened gate, Hajime, who was illuminated by the backlighting, looked back across his shoulder while smiling.<br/>
And then,<br/>
「Then, let’s start the travel to another world.」<br/>
Then he stepped inside the light ahead of everyone.<br/>
Sumire and Shuu looked at each other’s faces, and they burst into a bright smile. They raised 「Yafuuuuuh」 a cheer while leaping into the light following their son. After them, Yue and co followed while smiling.<br/>
「Now, Otou-san! Okaa-san! Let’s go!」<br/>
「O, ooh, yo-yo, you’re right! But, is this thing really all right……」<br/>
「As expected, it gives a bit of hesitation.」<br/>
Tomoichi got cold feet, and Kaoruko felt nervous. Kaori grasped the hand of her parents who were like that and jumped into the gate while pulling the two.<br/>
「He, hey, Aiko. I know that it’s fine, but the other side, that’s, it cannot be seen from here?」<br/>
「……It should be visible though……haa. This is because of Hajime-kun’s excessive dramatic act. Geez……sometimes he is just like a child.」<br/>
Aiko was making an expression of ‘really can’t be helped’ while taking the hand of Akiko who was getting a second thought as expected. Then she led her into the light.<br/>
Seeing the Shirasaki family and Hatayama family respond as such, Shizuku fired herself up「As expected; normally anyone will get a second thought like that this time. I have to get a hold of myself here!」.<br/>
「To think that I’ll be able to have a mysterious experience like this at this age. Kukuh, I’m feeling quite high spirited that is unbecoming for an old man.」<br/>
「That’s only reasonable, Oyajifather/old man. This is the world of sword and magic you know? It’s natural to be thrilled if you are a man. The first one from the Yaegashi family who will enter will be me!」<br/>
「Muh, damn Koichi! Getting a head start is unforgivable!」<br/>
「Geez, men will be like boys no matter how much time passes, isn’t it? But, fufu, my heart also cannot calm down, so I cannot say anything about other people myself. Please wait, dear! Otou-samafather-in-law!」<br/>
Every one in the Yaegashi family leapt into the light eagerly, leaving behind their daughter.<br/>
Inside the spacious underground workshop, Shizuku was left alone. Even though she was fired up because it was a trip to an unknown world for her family……her eyes were turning hollow.<br/>
But, seeing that the light was gradually getting weaker, she suddenly returned to her senses.<br/>
「Wa, waiiiit! Don’t leave me behiiind!」<br/>
She raised her voice in a panic while leaping into the gate.<br/>
–<br/>
–<br/>
–<br/>
The World Door was set up inside the Nagumo house’s underground workshop.<br/>
That door that was connected to another world with lights of seven colors overflowing was passed through by people who were fearful, people who were used to it, and also people who were high spirited.<br/>
Like that, while the *ringooon* sound that was like a church’s bell was ringing out, they whose eyes were narrowed because of the dazzling light finally managed to secure back their sight. There, what leapt into their sight was――<br/>
「……This is another world.」<br/>
「Haha……what grandeur. No more words are coming to me.」<br/>
It was a grandeur nature.<br/>
The World Door on the Tortus side was on the summit of a tower that was connected to the place with a sky corridor. Naturally, the sight was like a fantastic 360-degree panorama.<br/>
The God Mountain was destroyed, so although they couldn’t pay respect to the sight of the highest peak that once displayed a majestic appearance, the view around became better instead.<br/>
The mountain range that was continuing on and on to the north without end was truly the very sight of another world that was usually seen from fantasy movies and the like. The great plains that were spreading out to the south, the palace that was nearby, and the scenery of the capital that was filled with the sounds of reconstruction was within their view.<br/>
It was a magnificent sight that was the same as on Earth, but without any reason, from the air that the skin felt, the people who were currently watching in fascination at the scenery of Tortus from the summit of the tower felt it.<br/>
That this wasn’t Earth. That this was another world of sword and magic.<br/>
Sumire’s dazed muttering was agreed upon by Shuu who similarly had his eyes wide open.<br/>
Their voice finally caused the parents of each family to return to their senses.<br/>
The round tower was about a hundred meters above ground. Just in case, there was fence set up, but normally anyone would refrain from approaching the edge.<br/>
But, Tomoichi and Kaoruko, also Shuuzou and Koichi, Kirino too, and then even Akiko followed behind Sumire and Shuu who were striving to be the first to reach the handrail, and they ran their gaze to the sight below.<br/>
「……Nn, nnh. Ee~, below, you can see the capital of the Hairihi Kingdom that is in the middle of reconstruction.」<br/>
Suddenly, Yue pointed one hand slowly toward the capital while saying such a thing theatrically.<br/>
「Yue? What are you doing?」<br/>
Hajime asked as the representative of everyone.<br/>
「……I am tour guide, Yue. Entertaining the group is my mission!」<br/>
「Eh? Why tour guide?」<br/>
「……Bus guide-san at the school trip was amazing in various things; she looked like she was having fun, so I wanted to give it a try.」<br/>
「I, I see. Or rather, was that guide really that amazing?」<br/>
She was amazing. Her mental strength was.<br/>
Yue said that and then coughed.<br/>
「……And then, the mountain of rubbles that is visible over there is God Mountain that once boasted a height of the same level as Everest on Earth. It was destroyed by the meteors that Hajime rained down by a lot.」<br/>
「「「「「「……」」」」」」<br/>
For now, there were three convulsing expressions and three expressions that were unknown what kind of thought they contained. And then,<br/>
「As expected from my son! You got flashy there huh, oi! So you destroyed another world’s Everest!?」<br/>
「Please tell me! How did it turn out like that!?」<br/>
Even though their son was carrying out large scale destruction that changed the geography, for some reason, the Nagumo married couple Sumire and Shuu were making a ruckus with rocketing spirits.<br/>
Kaori answered in place of Hajime who was making a really conflicted expression.<br/>
「See, we knew that the enemy would come out from the God Mountain, so in that case, it’s fine isn’t it if they are blown away along with the God Mountain right after the battle started! That was the idea, wasn’t it? It was really amazing.」<br/>
「I guess. Countless meteors were raining down from the sky, and they impacted on God Mountain one after another……a shockwave that was like a great earthquake was spreading……I thought, perhaps the end of the world was something like that.」<br/>
Shizuku talked with a faraway look. Tomoichi asked with a convulsing expression still on his face.<br/>
「Ha, Hajime-kun. You, are you really able to make meteors rain down? I, I don’t think it’s possible, but you cannot do the same on Earth too, right?」<br/>
「……」<br/>
Hajime-san slowly averted his gaze. As expected, no matter what he couldn’t say that he was able to drop meteors down even on Earth. Furthermore, it didn’t just stop there; he had sent up a lot of satellite weapons into the orbit, where he would be able to go *buppa* with a sunlight convergence laser at any moment. It was even harder to say that.<br/>
Although, it could be guessed from his behavior. Tomoichi’s expression was convulsing grandly even more. One of the causes of his expression was also because Kaori was making a triumphant look for some reason. He wondered since when had my angel become a child who would be proud of mass destruction……<br/>
There, as though reading the mood, Shuu tapped on Tomoichi’s shoulder. When Tomoichi, who was busily rethinking the cultivation of his beloved daughter’s aesthetic sensibility, turned a conflicted gaze at him, Shuu made a nice smile that seemed to say 「It’s all right, leave it to me」 while nodding with a thumb up.<br/>
「Listen well, Hajime! Absolutely don’t use it on Earth! You understand, right!? It’s a promise with Tou-san!」<br/>
He rebuked with an unusually strong tone like that. Hajime’s eyes turned round seeing that, but even so, he smiled wryly and answered 「I got it. There is no way I will use something like that there」.<br/>
But,<br/>
「Are you serious? It’s absolute, you know? You really, really mustn’t use it. I’m telling you! A~bbsolutely y’know! Really――」<br/>
「Are you pretending!? Are you planning to make Hajime-kun use it!? I’ve been thinking of this since some time ago though! Hajime-kun’s unprecedented conduct was inherited from you, right!? Nagumo-Shuu!」<br/>
Tomoichi howled. The person in question himself was making a happy face like 「Tomo-kun’s reaction is really nice huuuh」. It went without saying that a pulsing vein snapped into place on Tomoichi’s forehead.<br/>
It looked like the grappling of Tomoichi VS Shuu would start again. Beside them, Kaoruko smiled wryly saying 「I’m sorry for my husband everyone」, while Sumire lowered her head saying 「My husband himself, it looks like he is really pleased with Tomoichi-san……I’m sorry that he is an idiot」.<br/>
There, tour guide Yue-san went *buppa* with a bombshell announcement that would send the place falling into even deeper chaos.<br/>
「……By the way, that was also the location of the headquarters of the sacred teaching church that was the largest religion on Tortus; but they were the puppet of the evil god with the pope for starters, so all the people there were bombed to death. By Aiko.」<br/>
「Hauh!?」<br/>
Aiko’s chest was pierced by the spear of words and she crumbled. Akiko was saying 「I heard the story, but when looking at the actual spot of the scene like this……I don’t have any words……」 with her expression somewhat pale, and her body slightly trembling.<br/>
「Oh my. Geez Aiko-sensei, even though you are as cute as a small animal……you are unexpectedly radical, aren’t you?」<br/>
「Hmmm. A teacher who won’t shirk from bombing many to death for the sake of the students……you are truly a model teacher.」<br/>
「I’m glad that you are the one in charge of Shizuku.」<br/>
「I’m sorry-sorry-sorry-sorry-sorry-sorry-sorry-sorry-sorry――police officer-san, I’m the culprit. Sorry-sorry-sorry-sorry-sorry」<br/>
Kirino hid her mouth elegantly with her hand while chuckling 「hohoho」, and Shuuzou with Koichi gave her words of praise……for Aiko it became an additional blow instead.<br/>
She was fiercely and doubly stimulated with trauma and guilt that she even began prostrating on the ground with hollow eyes while beginning to apologize profusely.<br/>
The parents who were on the verge of fighting because of what the children did, then began apologizing to each other, with pale expressions and praise from a playful sense of values……<br/>
Shia who was watching that smiled wryly, while Tio spoke with a troubled face.<br/>
「I have anticipated this, but as I thought, the travel through Tortus has become chaotic.」<br/>
「The number of people shouldst be reduced a bit mayhaps.」<br/>
On the other hand,<br/>
「Papaa~. We still aren’t going down nano~」<br/>
「My my, geez Myuu……to not only act completely unperturbed but instead even feel bored in this situation.」<br/>
Myuu was already urging to embark on the lift. As though to say that the chaotic situation before her eyes ‘ain’t my business at all’. Remia’s expression was turning conflicted seeing her daughter’s nerve that was getting bolder day by day.<br/>
Seeing everything including Myuu just now, Hajime looked up to the sunny sky.<br/>
「This is bad. I want to go home already.」<br/>
He muttered such a thing earnestly.<br/>

AN: Thank you very much for reading this every time.<br/>
Thank you very much too for the thoughts, opinions, and reports about misspelling and omitted words.<br/>
For those who hoped for the Abyss Lord arc, I’m sorry (sweat).<br/>
I’m unable to elaborate any plot yet!<br/>
And so, it will be my happiness if you all can go along with the idle chapters until I get an idea.<br/>
By the way, I also still haven’t thought of a concrete detail for Shia’s long arc.<br/>
Even the decision of which one to write is still pending. In any case, I’m thinking that writing some kind of long arc from the first Saturday of next year might be good timing to start perhaps.<br/>
There are two weeks remaining in this year, but please treat me well!<br/>
By the way, it feels like the Tortus Travel Journal will include a lot, so if there are a lot of people who say that they want to read it, I’m thinking of putting it in between bit by bit like Yue’s diary or the student life series.<br/>
