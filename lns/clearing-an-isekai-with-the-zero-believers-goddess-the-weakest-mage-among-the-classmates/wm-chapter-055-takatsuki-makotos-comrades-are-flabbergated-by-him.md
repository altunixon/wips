<br/>
TLN: A second chapter! Woop woop!<br/>
<br/>
"Takatsuki-sama…" (Nina)<br/>
"Makoto…" (Lucy)<br/>
When I returned to our table, Nina-san and Lucy spoke to me with faces of amazement and worry.<br/>
So these two with good ears heard it, huh.<br/>
"Takki-dono, I heard that you were rude to Princess Sofia…" (Fujiwara)<br/>
"I messed up, Fuji-yan." (Makoto)<br/>
"Takatsuki-kun, eat something sweet and calm down." (Aya)<br/>
Sa-san recommends me a cake <snicker>. <br/>
There’s even this?<br/>
"That’s unexpected. To think Takatsuki-sama would get so angry." (Nina)<br/>
"But you know, even though they brushed him aside when he pleaded so desperately 2 years ago, they forgot about it, and carefreely told him to become their ally. Of course he would get angry!" (Lucy)<br/>
Lucy is emotional, but she always takes my side.<br/>
I am grateful for that part of hers.<br/>
"Takki-dono, are you going to leave Makkaren, and move to Highland?" (Fujiwara)<br/>
Fuji-yan said sadly. <br/>
"Hmm, the bodyguard of the princess told me to leave after all…" (Makoto)<br/>
"Are you going to the country of Sakurai-kun?" (Aya)<br/>
Sa-san is eating donuts and fruits.<br/>
Aren’t you eating too much?<br/>
"I don’t have anywhere else in mind after all." (Makoto)<br/>
"Then I will be going there too." (Aya)<br/>
Hm? I look at Sa-san.<br/>
"What are you making that weird face for? I am the one who has nowhere else in mind aside from being at your side, Takatsuki-kun." (Aya)<br/>
With a face of ‘Isn’t that obvious?’, she gulps down her wine.<br/>
Donuts and wine don’t go together.<br/>
"Hmm, Highland, huh…" (Lucy)<br/>
Lucy is making a complicated expression.<br/>
"Are you against going to Highland, Lucy?" (Makoto)<br/>
"Takatsuki-sama, Highland is a human supremacist culture. It is a country that’s difficult to live in for an elf like Lucy-sama, and beastkin like me." (Nina)<br/>
Eh? Is that so? I didn’t know.<br/>
"The demi-humans and beastkin receive worse treatment than humans. I don’t really like it that much. Rozes doesn’t have that much in the discrimination department, which I like-desu zo." (Fujiwara)<br/>
"So you have chosen your tastes over business huh, Fuji-yan." (Makoto)<br/>
"Of course-desu zo!" (Fujiwara)<br/>
A friend that doesn’t break character.<br/>
"Nina-san, you don’t like Highland?" (Makoto)<br/>
"The nobles and merchants of that country immediately try to sexually harass beastkin. Even so, it is not like I can treat the customers badly, so I have to be careful." (Nina)<br/>
Hmm, Nina-san doesn’t have a good impression of the Sun Country either.<br/>
"Moreover, if a lamia like Sasaki-dono were to be exposed, it would be out in an instant. You would definitely be pursued." (Fujiwara)<br/>
"I see… Now that you mention it, if Highland were to discover my religion, it would be bad…" (Makoto)<br/>
"""It is bad in any country.""" <br/>
The 3 others aside from Sa-san retorted.<br/>
Is that so…<br/>
"Now that I think about it properly, it would be sad to not be able to meet Lucas-san, Mary-san, and the skewer stall old man again. Jean and Emily too…" (Makoto)<br/>
"Rethinking about leaving the country?" (Fujiwara)<br/>
Fuji-yan says with expectation.<br/>
"Hmm, should I lower my head to Princess Sofia…?" (Makoto)<br/>
After going all in like that, it really makes me hesitate.<br/>
Should I try asking Sakurai-kun? <br/>
No, but…<br/>
While I was pondering about this…<br/>
"Hey there, that just now was quite the disaster, wasn’t it?" <br/>
The one who came was the refreshing handsome hero, Sakurai-kun.<br/>
This bastard! Whose fault do you think it is that I am worrying here?! <br/>
"You called me to a weird gathering there, so it ended up in such a problem. What will you do about it?" (Makoto)<br/>
For now, I try to blame him with a straight gaze.<br/>
There’s Yokoyama-san at the side of Sakurai-kun, positioned in a way as if hiding from us.<br/>
"It is okay. If you enter the Sun Knight Order, I will do my all to help you out." (Sakurai)<br/>
Sakurai-kun says with a smile.<br/>
Wait, I don’t understand what you are saying though.<br/>
"I will never join." (Makoto)<br/>
The Sun Knight Order is basically the army, right?<br/>
There’s no way a go-home club guy like me can enter a group that’s like the gathering of athletic people! Get a clue!<br/>
I have the confidence to say that I would drop-out in one day. <br/>
"T-Takatsuki-kun, about today…uhm…thanks." (Yokoyama)<br/>
Yokoyama-san lowered her head to me.<br/>
It is rare for her to speak to me.<br/>
Or more like, is she a bit scared?<br/>
"I didn’t do anything big." (Makoto)<br/>
"W-What are you saying? You used Monarch Magic that only a handful of people in Highland can use, and were the second biggest contributor in this time’s subjugation of the Taboo Dragons!" (Yokoyama)<br/>
A lot of people were talking about the Monarch Magic, but they are all forgetting the fact that it required 1 week of preparation to use it one time.<br/>
"Well, leaving that aside, need something, Sakurai-kun?" (Makoto)<br/>
"Right. Actually, Great Sage-sama said she wanted to meet you, Takatsuki-kun…or more like, the Spirit User." (Sakurai)<br/>
"W-Wow! The Great Sage-sama that rarely shows herself in front of others! Nice, Makoto." (Lucy)<br/>
Lucy is getting happy as if it were her.<br/>
"Eeh…I don’t want to meet any more big shots though. Can I skip it?" (Makoto)<br/>
I had a terrible experience not that long ago. <br/>
I was partly at fault there too though.<br/>
"Takki-dono…the Great Sage-sama is the 3rd most influential person in the Sun Country. It would be best if you were to accept it…" (Fujiwara)<br/>
"Makoto! Don’t be selfish." (Lucy)<br/>
My comrades were pressuring me.<br/>
I really have to go, huh.<br/>
"Do I have to go alone?" (Makoto)<br/>
"No, she said it is okay to come with your comrades too." (Sakurai)<br/>
"Okay, Lucy and Sa-san, let’s go together." (Makoto)<br/>
I feel uneasy on my own.<br/>
"Is it okay? Yay!", Lucy jumps in happiness.<br/>
"Eeeh? That sounds like a pain. I’m fine", Sa-san makes an unwilling expression.<br/>
I am gonna drag my friend that has been eating carefreely all this time.<br/>
"Fuji-yan, what about you?" (Makoto)<br/>
"Hmm…I do want to meet her, but I can’t leave this table empty, so I will stay." (Fujiwara)<br/>
"Takatsuki-sama, don’t pick a fight with the Great Sage-sama, okay?" (Nina)<br/>
"I won’t do that…" (Makoto)<br/>
My evaluation in Nina-san’s eyes has lowered.<br/>
We were led by Sakurai-kun to the camp of the Sun Knight Order.<br/>
"What kind of person is the White Great Sage, Lucy?" (Makoto)<br/>
"She is the greatest mage of this continent. You already know that, right?" (Lucy)<br/>
"I don’t know in detail just what kind of person she is." (Makoto)<br/>
In the classes of the temple, we were simply taught that she is a mage with influence in the Sun Country.<br/>
"The first Great Sage-sama is a hero that fought together with the Saviour Abel against the Great Demon Lord 1,000 years ago. The person we are meeting is the 15th generation." (Sakurai)<br/>
Sakurai-kun explained.<br/>
"Hmm, but even if the 1st was great, that doesn’t have anything to do with their descendants." (Aya)<br/>
Sa-san says something sharp.<br/>
Please don’t say that in front of the person herself, okay? <br/>
I thought the same though.<br/>
"That’s not it, Aya. The Great Sage-sama has the [Inherit] Skill." (Lucy)<br/>
"The power of the 1st has been handed over in each generation. That’s the reason why she is called the continent’s strongest." (Sakurai)<br/>
"Huuh, I see." (Aya)<br/>
So she is inheriting the power of the legendary mage as it is?<br/>
That sounds strong.<br/>
While we were talking, we arrived at a giant tent.<br/>
A ringing sound echoes inside my head.<br/>
(Ma…ko…to. Makoto! Stop…don’t enter…that place! …Damn it!…) (Noah)<br/>
Goddess-sama? What’s the matter?<br/>
(Meeting her…is…) (Noah)<br/>
What’s going on?<br/>
This is the first time the communication has been this choppy.<br/>
What should I do…? Would it be better to not meet the Great Sage?<br/>
"Great Sage-sama, it is the captain of the 7th division, Sakurai. I have brought the Spirit User, Takatsuki-kun." (Sakurai)<br/>
Sakurai-kun’s call is directed to the inside of the tent.<br/>
