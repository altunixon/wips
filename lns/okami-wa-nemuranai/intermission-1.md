Wind of Vishrushapta<br/>
"Dear. The banquet's preparations are almost done."<br/>
"Aah, is it now. Let's call her ladyship once it is."<br/>
"But we could only scramble what we had on hand."<br/>
"Hasn't her ladyship said that she doesn't mind."<br/>
"Even so, the Head Chef was complaining, if only they had more time to prepare."<br/>
"Haha. Her ladyship is surely accustomed to the highest degree of culinary. She might even find simple dishes of a countryside to her liking."<br/>
"My! How could you say our family cooking countryside."<br/>
"Countryside fish and vegetable are fine, so long as she enjoys it."<br/>
"She's surely has a discriminating palate."<br/>
"Oho. I see you've stopped doubting her ladyship's standing."<br/>
"Oh please don't mention that anymore. I mean, she didn't have an escort, she steered a cart by herself, her body was full of mud and she even had armor on her. Who would believe that she's a daughter of Reinzats House."<br/>
"However, her armor and sword are worth this entire mansion. Besides, the luggage and barrel on her cart."<br/>
"Yes! The head and legs of Dungeon Ninae's boss. Even the elites of Royal Knights can't get hold of such things so easily. And yet, that lovely young lady would."<br/>
"You said lovely there."<br/>
"Oh right, you didn't see it, dear. How her ladyship looked after a bath. Her smooth flushed skin like that of the highest silk. Her lustrous hair. And her jewel-like pupils. The maids have been completely captivated by her ladyship already."<br/>
"Hou. I can't wait for the banquet."<br/>
"She's quite gallant in her armor, but in dress she's just."<br/>
"I don't doubt her swordsmanship, her being a knight, but it appears she's well versed in music as well. She was looking for a Shetrada earlier."<br/>
"My, I had no idea. But still, she surely had robust subordinates that accompanied her conquering the dungeon, where would they be now I wonder. How dare they left her ladyship to go on alone."<br/>
"I did ask her ladyship about it. But she put on quite a sorrowful look on her face then. There must have been some sort of complicated circumstances."<br/>
"Right it is. It must be. But truly, I can't believe she would rely on our house."<br/>
"I've never been happier our son works as an adjutant to the Royal Knight's Commander."<br/>
"Yes really. Oh that kid, despite his lack of tact, he has got her ladyship's trust, doesn't he. Perhaps, maybe."<br/>
"Now now. We do not chew more than we can swallow. Our standing is too far apart to Marquis House of Reinzats. It will never bring anything good."<br/>
"You're right. Of course."<br/>
"Personally, I cannot wait for the next palatial visit."<br/>
"My, why would that be."<br/>
"Think about it. Naturally, there is no chance of me meeting with Marquis Reinzats directly. However, his excellency Prime Minister will surely come to greet me."<br/>
"My."<br/>
"What do you think his excellency would say then. Of course. He'd surely thank me for taking care of his niece."<br/>
"That's wonderful."<br/>
"It'd be the highest honor. And the rumor of his excellency owing me a debt would quickly spread. And of course, those merchants would surely shift their attitudes. Hahaha. I cannot wait for it."<br/>
"My."<br/>
"Oh. It's the sound of Shetrada."<br/>
"It's a song! She's singing a song."<br/>
"What a gorgeous sounding tune."<br/>

Listen to the sound of wind<br/>
Listen to the sound of wind<br/>
As I bring my voice<br/>
As I bring my voice<br/>
To that departed someone<br/>
To that departed someone<br/>
O rocky path<br/>
O desert path<br/>
Stricken by rain<br/>
Dried by drought<br/>
Where that person is<br/>
Heroic travel<br/>
Travel of encounters<br/>
Wounded, falling<br/>
Getting up<br/>
Are you still doing that even now<br/>
Leaves of Vishrushapta swaying<br/>
Foreign wind blowing<br/>
Blowing breeze<br/>
Carrying the voice of that someone<br/>
I announced our parting<br/>
I let go of your hand<br/>
Even so, even so, that person<br/>
Never told me to come with him<br/>
Never told me to live together with him<br/>
O wind<br/>
O wind<br/>
O wind blowing from a country far away<br/>
I know about you<br/>
I know of your birth<br/>
Walking together that person and me<br/>
Overcoming steep paths<br/>
At dawn of a miraculous morning<br/>
You were born to this world<br/>
But those days in memories are far gone<br/>
The places in those memories are far gone<br/>
Passing away with dreams, sun and moon<br/>
That place has been shuttered down<br/>
Hence let this song hold<br/>
The pain of rending hearts<br/>
O wind<br/>
O wind<br/>
Let this be carried<br/>
Listen to the sound of wind<br/>
Listen to the sound of wind<br/>
The throbbing in this chest<br/>
The throbbing in this chest<br/>
Thinking of that person, the wind knows<br/>
Thinking of that person, the wind knows<br/>
"<Wind of Vishrushapta> is it. It feels like the lyrics are a bit different however."<br/>
"This must be the version of lyrics currently popular in the royal capital. What an absolutely beautiful voice she has."<br/>
"She's truly a bearer of rare talents in both military and literary arts."<br/>
"Hey, dear. Can't you make her ladyship stay another night at least. We could call our nephews here then."<br/>
"You. She said she wanted to return to the royal capital as soon as possible. She's made it very clear. We would only incur her ladyship's wrath trying to detain her."<br/>
"Master, Madam. Preparations for the banquet are complete."<br/>
"I see. Go inform her ladyship Heles Reinzats."<br/>
