						<p>TL: It seems this is my site’s first anniversary, and my own anniversary of taking up translating. Maybe I should just go buy a domain already. Ah, also, I’m struggling to innovatively translate the toxic maid’s insults. Maybe I need an englishman.</p>
<p>Prologue</p>
<p>Inside the Circry House’s estate in Arumsaas, I was eating my meal.</p>
<p>I usually eat Novem’s cooking, but only for today, a certain 【Toxic Automaton】 insisted she would do it, and she wouldn’t budge on the matter.</p>
<p>It seems she possesses a sense of rivalry against Novem, but it’s strange no matter how you look at it.</p>
<p>That scrap metal maid… the moment she came to the mansion, she directed an attack at the girl.</p>
<p>She had picked up the nearest broom, and tried to lower it on Novem’s head, but I stopped her…</p>
<p>“How is it? The taste of the food I put my all into making for a wimpy chicken dickwad?”</p>
<p>Chicken dickwad was likely referring to me.</p>
<p>It seems that since I didn’t have the high spirits of when we first met, she added a wimpy to it.</p>
<p>“No, it’s delicious. It’s much tastier than I imagined, but…”</p>
<p>“But? But what? A chicken dickwad has some complaints to voice against my cooking? Now out with it. Tomorrow, I’ll make use of those complaints to prepare the supreme dish.”</p>
<p>I looked at the other dishes lining the table.</p>
<p>The presentation was perfect.</p>
<p>There was no problem with the taste. In fact, it was delicious.</p>
<p>The fact that an automaton could do this much was truly a truth I hadn’t imagined.</p>
<p>“… Isn’t there a gap between my plate and the others?”</p>
<p>Only I had a larger portion.</p>
<p>The scrap metal looked at me, and let out a scornful laugh.</p>
<p>“That, of all things? I prepared a greater portion of food for my master, the chicken dickwad. I did not exceed the sum of money I was permitted, so there shouldn’t be a problem?”</p>
<p>There was a problem.</p>
<p>“Hey, you see, this is Miranda-san’s mansion. We’re just freeloaders!”</p>
<p>Miranda-san, who was eating alongside us, spoke.</p>
<p>“Ah, you don’t have to worry about that. How about it. Why not just become the master here?”</p>
<p>The pale green haired Miranda-san looked at me with her emerald eyes.</p>
<p>Her mischievous intentions were blatently visible.</p>
<p>She was definitely having fun.</p>
<p>I thought she was a cat-like person, but following the events of our previous dungeon expedition, more of her personality was showing than before.</p>
<p>I looked towards Novem, with her brown side ponytail.</p>
<p>Novem didn’t seem to be noticing my glance.</p>
<p>And she took a bite…</p>
<p>“For Lyle-sama’s preferences, the taste is a little light.”</p>
<p>And said that.</p>
<p>Hearing that, Aria let out a sigh.</p>
<p>The red-haired Aria directed her violet eyes at me.</p>
<p>“Make sure you don’t let them go too far.”</p>
<p>The reason Aria felt fed up was because of this piece of junk.</p>
<p>I mean, this pile of scraps…</p>
<p>“Mu! So this is the rumored 『Stepmother Bullying the Young Wife』 entry in my data! Are you perhaps unsatisfied with my cooking? Considering nutritional balance, I have surely created the finest of tastes.”</p>
<p>… Liked to compete with Novem.</p>
<p>I’m not even sure why, but only to Novem did she ever display an emotion like hostility.</p>
<p>Seeing the situation, from the blue Jewel hung at my neck came a voice only I could hear.</p>
<p>The Fourth Generation Head of the Walt House, 【Max Walt】 had his long blue hair parted in a seven to three ration at the front, and glasses hanging on his face.</p>
<p>Within the Jewel, everyone had manifest in a form somewhere around their thirties.</p>
<p>This Fourth’s notable characteristic was… not just his glasses.</p>
<p>『Good grief, what a strange automaton. For her to pick a fight with Novem-chan, just what could she be thinking… now stop them already, Lyle.』</p>
<p>In regards to women, the Fourth was quite loud.</p>
<p>No, to be more specific, in regards to the treatment of women.</p>
<p>“Hah, scrap metal, isn’t that enough? Why are you always on at Novem?”</p>
<p>As the Fourth requested, I stopped the scrap metal.</p>
<p>But surprisingly, Novem…</p>
<p>“Lyle-sama, I think scrap metal is a little cruel. We’ve finally gotten ourselves a new comrade, so we’ll have to decide on a name.”</p>
<p>What a nice girl…</p>
<p>In contrast.</p>
<p>“For you to show mercy to the enemy… that naivety will cost you your life one day. Even if I look like this, I was manufactured as a top of the line model, and I’ve even been praised as his greatest masterpiece. I can’t be receiving mercy from…”</p>
<p>As she started into some incomprehensible words, Miranda-san spoke.</p>
<p>“Then isn’t scrap metal good enough?”</p>
<p>“… Chicken dickwad, I am pleading to you with upturned eyes, so please decide a worthy name for me, dammit.”</p>
<p>That isn’t the right attitude to ask a favor.</p>
<p>But only her mouth was bad, and pertaining to me, she did actually apply her all.</p>
<p>The housework that was hard for Novem alone had become much easier because of her, or so I’ve heard.</p>
<p>“… Looking at the movement of those twin tails, something’s come to mind.”</p>
<p>As I voiced that, scrap metal took the bait.</p>
<p>“Oh! For you to lust after these twin tails, you’ve got good eyes there. My makers even got into a fist fight over deciding between black bobbed hair, and these blond twin tails. As I thought, twin tails truly are the greatest.”</p>
<p>“I kinda get a poyo poyo feeling as the move back and forth, so 【Poyopoyo】 is…”</p>
<p>(TL: Just imagine the feeling something swinging back and forth leisurely gives off.)</p>
<p>The scrap metal’s refreshing expression suddenly turned expressionless.</p>
<p>The one who was holding her stomach in laughter… was Shannon.</p>
<p>In the past, she was a sightless, frail noble lady, but with her sister being something like that, the younger sister was quite a villain in her own regard.</p>
<p>“You’ve got no naming sense.”</p>
<p>The one who extended her hand towards the giggling Shannon was Miranda-san.</p>
<p>She used her left hand to grab the top of her head, squeezed, and lifted her up like that.</p>
<p>I’m starting to hear a creaking sound.</p>
<p>“O-onee-sama, it hurts! It really, really hurts!”</p>
<p>“There’s no point in giving me that cute tone. You’re being rude to Poyopoyo, who finally received her long-awaited name.”</p>
<p>As she said that, Aria covered her mouth.</p>
<p>Only Novem continued eating while she seemed to be thinking of various things with a serious expression on her face.</p>
<p>“… Chicken bastard. If it’s now, I will accept a revision.”</p>
<p>Poyopoyo said that, so I shook my head.</p>
<p>“No alterations, Poyopoyo.”</p>
<p>The Fourth raised an angered voice from within the Jewel…</p>
<p>『No matter how you look at it, that’s going too far! You have to be nice to girls!』</p>
<p>And said something like that.</p>
<p>(There’s no doubt this guy’s wife subjected him to something.)</p>
<p>From the other’s ancestors’ conduct, I can guess he was quite a submissive husband.</p>
<p>This man acting up about women, was the head with the longest term of service in the Walt family’s history.</p>
<p>The Third fell in battle in his thirties, and so he took over the title in his teens.</p>
<p>From there on, I heard he mostly contributed in domestic affairs, but…</p>
<p>『And wait, is there really no maintenance costs on that girl? She just sucks Lyle’s Mana, right? If there’s a service fee, wouldn’t that be a pain? Perhaps even a normal servant maid would be better.』</p>
<p>He was also loud about money.</p>
<p>I heard he handles things on the financial front as well, but when I’m actually here conversing with him, he just keeps prattling on about money.</p>
<p>It seemed he was the sort of man who would choose money over women.</p>
<p>That was the Fourth Generation, but only concerning his wife did he ever turn frail.</p>
<p>His son, the Fifth spoke.</p>
<p>『Oy, weren’t you saying something about being nice to girls? No wait, while her outside is female, her insides are iron, or something, right?』</p>
<p>The Fourth…</p>
<p>『Oh, right… but Poyopoyo is cruel.』</p>
<p>But yeah, perhaps Poyopoyo was a bit much.</p>
<p>Expressionlessly, Poyopoyo (temp) continued to grumble on about demanding a change.</p>
<p>“Master, won’t you consider it a bit longer? Please use that meaningless godforsaken brain of yours to think of a name for my sake. I’ll be sure to treasure it. If it’s a proper name, I’ll be sure to treasure it, so…”</p>
<p>Scary. This automaton is scary.</p>
<p>“Oy, that’s a little scary, so please stop. I get it. I’ll think. I’ll think about it, so please give me some more time”</p>
<p>As I said that, the troublesome pile of scrap metal returned a smile.</p>
<p>“As expected, the chicken dickwad is weak to a woman’s pressure!”</p>
<p>I also shot back a smile.</p>
<p>“Only your skin’s a woman, and your insides are black, right? How about we stop denying reality here.”</p>
<p>An angered scrap pile told me.</p>
<p>“What are you saying? As a special model of the highest grade, there is nothing impossible for me. If I was in the mood, then even a gentleman’s lustful urges are…”</p>
<p>After she said that much, Novem spoke.</p>
<p>“We’re in the middle of a meal, Poyopoyo-san.”</p>
<p>The scrap metal bit down on her hankerchief mortifyingly.</p>
<p>“T-this bitch…”</p>
<p>Dinner at the Circry House has become lively all of a sudden, but it’s gotten quite enervating.</p>
<p>&#8211;</p>
<p>&#8211;</p>
<p>&#8211;</p>
<p>“And so, that’s why you’ve come here, is what you’re saying?”</p>
<p>The Library.</p>
<p>It was a place meant for one to drop by and store up knowledge, but today, I was reading alongside Clara.</p>
<p>While we read our books, we exchanged various conversations.</p>
<p>A while ago, I accepted the request of Damien, a famous professor of Arumsaas, the City of Scholars, and we ended up working together.</p>
<p>While she specialized in support, she was a skilled adventurer.</p>
<p>Her deep blue hair was cut around her shoulders, but perhaps she had done that herself, as the edges were quite ruffled.</p>
<p>It seems she liked reading books here, as whenever I came, I had quite a high probability of finding her.</p>
<p>I usually ask her about what books are interesting, but we would occasionally exchange such gossip.</p>
<p>“That’s right. That scrap metal keeps insisting I decide a name, and she competes with Novem.”</p>
<p>“How strange. Could her rivalry with Novem be on her job as a maid?”</p>
<p>I don’t know that one either.</p>
<p>I mean, that piece of junk… is broken.</p>
<p>There’s how she doesn’t remember some important things, but her tone towards me is generally terrible.</p>
<p>“The individual herself said her sensors labelled her as an enemy or something.”</p>
<p>“Well, she’s an ancient automaton, so it’s amazing enough that she can even move. Ah, come to think of it…”</p>
<p>Clara remembered something, and conveyed it to me.</p>
<p>“At the academy, Damien is moving around more automata. He’s gotten three of them operational, and he’s confirming the situation.”</p>
<p>Right now Damien was the talk of the town.</p>
<p>Just being able to move an ancient automaton and control it was amazing in itself.</p>
<p>Hearing that, I thought…</p>
<p>“Why is it that my scrap metal is like that… should I swap it in?”</p>
<p>Clara responded.</p>
<p>“She’s properly doing her job, right? Is there some sort of problem?”</p>
<p>“Her choice of words, I guess? Everything else is perfect. Cleaning, laundry, and cooking, she’ll do it all.”</p>
<p>She really was quite perfect, but I’d like to do something about that mouth.</p>
<p>“Well, I think you should give up on that. I did hear it was a form of contract, and the means to sever it are as of yet unknown, so you’ll be like that all your life.”</p>
<p>“Please don’t make me remember those things…”</p>
<p>For the contract to the automaton, my own blood was needed as a catalyst.</p>
<p>But having just gone through a Growth, my spirits were high, and I went ahead to kiss the Automaton to activate it.</p>
<p>(Was that where it went wrong? No, she said she got broken of her own accord.)</p>
<p>“Even so…”</p>
<p>Clara looked at me.</p>
<p>“Hmm?”</p>
<p>“You sure do some troublesome things. Restricting your own Skills, and aiming for the labyrinth’s thirtieth floor?”</p>
<p>Last time when we challenged the labyrinth, we made it past the fortieth floor’s boss with but a party of six.</p>
<p>Apparently, it was an enemy that would usually require fifty.</p>
<p>And it’s good that we achieved results and all, but seeing that, the ancestors imposed a restriction of my Skills until I defeated the thirtieth floor’s boss.</p>
<p>Under the banner that my own abilities were overwhelmingly lacking, they forbid any such usage of any Skills in my possession.</p>
<p>Because of that, I somehow have to use my own strength to break through the chappence.</p>
<p>While it may sound easy in words, the challenge was on a scale where it required from twenty to thirty adventurers.</p>
<p>“It’s a personal matter. If I remain too reliant on my Skills, then it will be dangerous once my Mana runs out.”</p>
<p>As I expressed the ancestors’ reasoning, Clara made a slight surprised face.</p>
<p>“… I was sure you hadn’t noticed it, and that you were going to make a huge mistake one day. It seems I’ll have to reassess m evaluation of you, Lyle-san.”</p>
<p>“H-how cruel.”</p>
<p>As I said that, I get the feeling she was smiling a little.</p>
<p>“If anything happens, call out to me. With your ample funds, I don’t think I would be at a loss to hear you out.”</p>
<p>So it’s a matter of money, I thought… but in truth, to adventurers like us, money was essential.</p>
<p>In order to live, we threw ourselves into life threatening situations.</p>
<p>And if the money we obtained was what we used to get by, we had to be firm in that regard.</p>
<p>Of course, I’ve taken various things onto myself, and I’m in a standing where I have to earn enough to support two women, and one automaton.</p>
<p>(But really, what is it that I should to)</p>
<p>If we simply raised greater numbers to challenge it, then it really would be easy.</p>
<p>But during Damien’s request, I displayed quite a sorry sight.</p>
<p>(Because I returned to the guild carried by Novem, my reputation… is quite low.)</p>
<p>At the end of the end, I became unable to move my body, and I showed off quite a terrible state to the other adventurers.</p>
<p>For that reason, my own personable credibility is low.</p>
<p>While I want to gather the numbers, my questionable standing in Arumsaas is dragging my feet.</p>
<p>(As I thought, there’s no choice but for me to steadily build up my own strength.)</p>
<p>My sudden Growth, and the fact that I produced results was all because of the Heads of History’s Skills recorded in the Jewel.</p>
<p>If I become unable to use them, it’s exceedingly troublesome.</p>
<p>(I’ll have to think of a way to overcome the thirtieth floor.)</p>
<p>As I thought that, I continued to pile up the knowledge of the library.</p>
