Epilogue<br/>
<br/>
──The number of customers at Centralle’s bars increased when it became night.<br/>
Halite visited a bar that was quite expensive. He talked with a waiter and got shown to a private room.<br/>
The guest he came to meet was waiting while drinking alcohol before him.<br/>
「Maksim, long time no see.」<br/>
The large man called Maksim raised his hand at Halite.<br/>
「Ou, last time was when I headed to your place as reinforcement huh. You also look well.」<br/>
A lot of skirmishes took place near the country’s borders, because of that sometimes they would request reinforcements from the surroundings. The two of them were acquainted from such chance.<br/>
「You “Sand Giant” also looks energetic like usual. And, have you heard about that story?」<br/>
After the waiter left the room, Halite talked to Maksim with a small voice.<br/>
「I want to believe that it’s a lie though. Doing something like breaking off an engagement isn’t a sane decision. That’s even truer when the engagement involves the relationship between two countries.」<br/>
Halite was also of the same opinion. He carefully spoke with a small voice so that no one else could hear. It might be overly cautious of him doing this in a private room, but that was just how dangerous this conversation was.<br/>
「Even though the rumor still hasn’t spread widely but, it seems to be true. I’ve confirmed with my caregiver too.」<br/>
「…..That’s not a funny joke.」<br/>
He shortly spoke because it wasn’t a story that could be spoken of too loudly.<br/>
「The situation in Centralle has been getting strange bit by bit since some time ago. That’s why my caregiver and your lord also came to Centralle.」<br/>
Maksim drank his alcohol while talking about Centralle’s abnormality.<br/>
「It’s not just the nobles. Even the citizens feel strange. Do you know? When the Walt House came to Centralle before this, it seems that a part of the city got really high-spirited. Certainly they’re a famous house but, it’s still abnormal.」<br/>
Halite made a bitter face when he heard the name Walt.<br/>
「The reason the crown prince broke off the engagement is also because of that Walt House. No, more accurately it’s because of the only daughter of the Walt House.」<br/>
「The only daughter? Ah, the eldest son was disinherited wasn’t it? I wondered what’s up with that but……wait, that story is true?」<br/>
Halite nodded and talked to Maksim about the information he gathered.<br/>
「I met that disinherited eldest son today. Certainly he’s got some strange sides to him but, it didn’t seem so bad that he had to be disinherited. Rather, he’s got some promise. If we fought, then even you or I will get injured facing him.」<br/>
Maksim laughed hearing that.<br/>
「Nice. I welcome a strong guy. It will be even better if it’s as an ally. And, what do you mean by strange side?」<br/>
Halite hesitated to talk, and then he told him about how Lyle defeated three men with a fishing rod and also reeled up a girl with it. Maksim listened with an opened mouth and at the end he laughed loudly.<br/>
「That’s hilarious!」<br/>
Halite also laughed a bit.<br/>
「Certainly. Well, it’s not something to do to a girl but, at the end he chased the girl to apologize, so he isn’t a bad person. Now then, let’s talk about the main topic.」<br/>
Halite’s expression turned serious. Maksim also straightened his sitting posture.<br/>
「If the engagement is broken up like this, then Bahnseim will be thrown into chaos. No, perhaps sparks of conflict will be lit up all over the continent. No matter what, it will be a bad development. Maksim, you should be careful too.」<br/>
Maksim nodded, and then the two released their tension and drank together as friends──<br/>
.<br/>
──Arumsaas.<br/>
It was the center of educational institutions. A city that was unusual even within Bahnseim.<br/>
There were also a lot of noble youngsters attending the academy as students. Many of them rented apartments or slightly extravagant rooms to live in, but it also wasn’t rare for the noble youngsters from houses with a peerage to rent a mansion in Arumsaas.<br/>
Inside one such mansion.<br/>
Two sisters were living in a mansion that was rented by the Viscount Circry House.<br/>
The elder sister Miranda Circry was using the lap of her little sister, Shannon Circry as a pillow on her little sister’s bed with an empty expression.<br/>
Shannon caressed Miranda’s hair.<br/>
「Geez Onee-sama, this is because you’re so obstinate. Even though it would be better if you just obediently listened to me.」<br/>
Shannon──she had wavy long hair with a faint purple color and white skin. Perhaps because she never went outside, the whiteness of her skin was standing out. And then, above all else, what attracted attention to her was her golden colored pupils in her drooping eyes. Normally her pupils had a yellow color, but right now they were shining gold.<br/>
The elder sister Miranda had wavy hair with a light green color that grew until her shoulders. Her green eyes that usually looked bright were being closed. Her eyes would slowly open sometimes, but they were lightless and showed a lack of clarity.<br/>
She was sleeping on the lap of Shannon who had a slender body, but the elder sister Miranda had a feminine body that grew where it should grow.<br/>
Her face that was normally like a mischievous kid was buried onto her little sister’s lap without showing any vitality.<br/>
「Aua……」<br/>
She couldn’t make any word coherently, and her little sister was doing whatever she pleased with her. It was a strange sight.<br/>
Shannon looked up to the ceiling with eyes that couldn’t see, and then the corners of her lips rose into a smile.<br/>
「Soon. It will be soon. The Circry House that threw me away and also that woman who wouldn’t recognize me, I’ll make them recognize me.」<br/>
Shannon clenched her right hand, and with her eyes that couldn’t see she was watching the “flow of mana”. It was something that normal people couldn’t see. She couldn’t see what normal people could see, but her eyes could see what couldn’t be seen.<br/>
It was the “power” that Shannon who was frail and cast away by her house, had obtained.<br/>
Shannon obtained the skill to read the flow of and make use of mana. She used her elder sister Miranda as a guinea pig in an attempt to control her heart.<br/>
「Now, Onee-sama, I’ll have you become my cute puppet. Work for my sake okay?」<br/>
From a position that Shannon couldn’t see, Miranda who was burying her face into Shannon’s lap lifted the corners of her lips and smiled with a face that looked even more calculating than Shannon──<br/>
.<br/>
──The next day.<br/>
Miranda stood in the kitchen from early in the morning and prepared breakfast.<br/>
「Haa. ……I wonder why the maid wouldn’t continue? There is no problem with the work requirement, and I think the salary is better compared to other places, and yet why?」<br/>
A daughter of a noble was cooking in the morning and even took care of her little sister. Considering her position as a capital noble, and furthermore as a young lady of a Viscount house, it was a strange sight.<br/>
The sound of the door opening could be heard.<br/>
「Oh. You woke up already, Shannon?」<br/>
「Yes, Onee-sama.」<br/>
Her little sister replied with a frail voice. She was sitting on a wheelchair and moved while touching the wall. In front of such a little sister, Miranda responded with a smile.<br/>
「Wait for a bit more okay? I’ll prepare the meal soon. Also, I’ll prepare the meal for the noon too, so eat it later properly. I’m going to the academy after this, so no matter who comes to visit, you mustn’t carelessly go out.」<br/>
Shannon replied adorably.<br/>
「I understand Onee-sama. More importantly, are you busy in the academy?」<br/>
Miranda placed her hand on her waist.<br/>
「Somewhat, I think. There is an interesting class though. ……Oops, I have to hurry. Shannon, let’s wash your face before breakfast.」<br/>
Miranda who looked after her blind little sister was a really nice big sister. She was kind, and then because she couldn’t leave Shannon , who was blind, alone she even brought her together with her to this Arumsaas.<br/>
「Yes, Onee-sama.」<br/>
Miranda pushed the wheelchair towards the bathroom and asked Shannon what she wanted to eat today.<br/>
It was the sight of two close sisters──<br/>
<br/>
.<br/>
The academy city Arumsaas could be seen from the connecting coach’s window.<br/>
While the long trip was quite interesting, as expected sitting continuously like this is also becoming boring. I look outside the window and feel relieved that the destination is coming into view.<br/>
「We finally arrived at Arumsaas.」<br/>
It was located near the southern part. It’s directly connected to Centralle through the connecting coach. The traveling is convenient but, the distance is really far as expected.<br/>
Aria-san also rotated her shoulder as though to exclaim ‘finally’.<br/>
「My body hurts from sitting too much. Even so, there are a lot of buildings that are higher than the outer wall there.」<br/>
There are a lot of buildings that peeked through the outer wall. It’s obvious how high the buildings are even from afar.<br/>
Sophia-san also looked outside the window in slight excitement.<br/>
「Arumsaas is also a really big city isn’t it? It’s amazing how developed it is even though there is no feudal lord there.」<br/>
Novem explained to Sophia-san.<br/>
「It’s because it’s a special place, and it’s a city that is rich with resources from the dungeon it has. Well, it seems that it’s definitely stranger than other cities. Also, I heard that the city isn’t too kind towards adventurers.」<br/>
I’m surprised.<br/>
「Eh? Will we be fine then?」<br/>
Novem amended in a hurry.<br/>
「No, the treatment there won’t be that horrible. It’s just that the priority there is unique. In Dalien the feudal lord is controlling the guild firmly, but in Arumsaas it’s the academy that is controlling the city.」<br/>
The academy is controlling the city? I don’t really understand the place.<br/>
The ancestors inside the Jewel are also really interested.<br/>
『Academy city, huh. I wonder what kind of place it is.』<br/>
『Well, we’ll understand when we arrive. More importantly, I’m curious about the library there.』<br/>
『It will be great if you can learn various things there.』<br/>
『The academy is controlling the city? I won’t be able to say anything without actually seeing it myself.』<br/>
『It feels like there will be few place to have fun in a stuffy place like this.』<br/>
『It has a dungeon and has an abundance of magic stones and materials after all. Also, it’s a place to send noble youngsters to is it? It feels like there will be a lot of capital nobles there. I hope there won’t be any disputes there.』<br/>
That’s a bit of a concern because we got into a bit of a dispute at Centralle. I don’t want to get dragged into unnecessary trouble.<br/>
It will be great if I can learn various things, but…….<br/>
When I noticed, Novem is looking at my face with a smile.<br/>
「Wha, what?」<br/>
「Lyle-sama, you’re making a really good face.」<br/>
「Is that so? It will be great if that’s true.」<br/>
When I answered like that, Aria-san also spoke to me.<br/>
「Yep, your face looks better than before. After the dungeon subjugation, from your expression it feels like you’ve been freed from something.」<br/>
Sophia-san also said a similar opinion.<br/>
「You’re right. Should I say that the experience there wasn’t pointless?」<br/>
I scratched my cheek shyly.<br/>
「I’ve promised Rondo-san and Rex-san after all. If I don’t do my best, I’ll get laughed at when we meet again at Beim.」<br/>
Yes, I promised. That we will meet at Beim. Then, right now I can just aim for Beim. I still can’t imagine myself as a first rate adventurer.<br/>
However, I want to stand side by side equally with my friends.<br/>
The ancestors inside the Jewel are also a bit understanding at my opinion.<br/>
『Well, it’s fine like this for now.』<br/>
『Yeah. You can decide after learning various things.』<br/>
『I myself am interested in what kind of vision of the future that Lyle will have.』<br/>
『No matter what you’re going to do, you will need strength and money. In order to obtain them, I can agree with you polishing your adventuring skills.』<br/>
『I wish that you’ll also learn to have fun for a bit though.』<br/>
『Should I feel happy for my grandson’s growth, or should I grieve that he will keep progressing as an adventurer like this……』<br/>
The connecting coach approached Arumsaas’s gate.<br/>
I said to Novem, Aria-san, and Sophia-san.<br/>
「Well then, let’s prepare to get down.」<br/>
Arumsaas, just what kind of place is it? I’m also getting a bit nervous from anxiety and expectation.<br/>
