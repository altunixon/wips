Hnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnng Melty and Fitoria <br/>
Vote what to call the chocobos http://strawpoll.me/2634567/ <br/>
Firo stays as Firo regardless of what wins. <br/>
Chapter 66 <br/>
 <br/>
Ahoge <br/>
 <br/>
"Ya!" <br/>
 <br/>
Firo attacks first. <br/>
She jumps with all her might and reaches the belly of Fitoria's gigantic figure. <br/>
 <br/>
"Kue" <br/>
 <br/>
Fitora flaps her wings and dodges swiftly. <br/>
 <br/>
"Ha!" <br/>
 <br/>
While Firo was landing back on the ground, Fitoria slices at her with a wing. <br/>
 <br/>
"Oops!" <br/>
 <br/>
Firo barely avoids the wing by diving to the side. <br/>
 <br/>
"Firo-chan do you best!" <br/>
 <br/>
Melty loudly cheers her on. <br/>
 <br/>
"""Guaaaaaaaaaaa~!""" <br/>
 <br/>
The Philorials similarly support Fitoria with their cries. <br/>
 <br/>
"I will not lose~!" <br/>
 <br/>
Firo charges up to Fitoria. <br/>
 <br/>
"Kue!" <br/>
 <br/>
Fitoria tries to bat Firo away using her wings, but Firo dexterously uses the wing as a scaffold and jumps for her face. <br/>
 <br/>
"Wow! Amazing~!" <br/>
 <br/>
Firo's attack unfortunately ends in failure, but she calls out in admiration. <br/>
 <br/>
"Very fast. But I won't lose." <br/>
 <br/>
After taking a stance with her wings Firo begins preparing. <br/>
Are you going to suddenly use your special ability? <br/>
 <br/>
"Yay, here it come~" <br/>
 <br/>
Firo's body becomes a blur. <br/>
In the next moment, a loud wham could be heard...... <br/>
 <br/>
"Kue" <br/>
 <br/>
At first glance, it seemed Fitora was slowly waving her wings up and down. <br/>
 <br/>
"Waaaaaaaa!" <br/>
 <br/>
Firo was blown into the air and knocked around. <br/>
After being Forced to expand her wings to control the air flow, Firo lands. <br/>
 <br/>
"To think you would dodge Firo's trump card so easily-" <br/>
"Kue" <br/>
 <br/>
Fitoria puts one of her wings on her waist and taunts Firo. <br/>
To act in such a carefree attitude. <br/>
Amazing. <br/>
Brushing off Firo's ultimate attack just like that...... <br/>
 <br/>
"As expected of the legendary Philorial." <br/>
 <br/>
Melty expresses her admiration. <br/>
I agree. <br/>
What can I say. Our combat expert Firo is being toyed with. <br/>
 <br/>
"How about this!" <br/>
 <br/>
Firo flaps her wings again. <br/>
 <br/>
"Firo commands the origin of power. Firo has read and deciphered a law of nature. Blow her away with a raging tornado!" <br/>
"Tzuvait ・Tornado!" <br/>
"What?" <br/>
 <br/>
To think Firo could use intermediate magic! I doubt she could teach me...... <br/>
If you could have always used it, then you should have. <br/>
We could have ran away from those heroes easily if that spell was used. <br/>
The tornado brought forth from Firo's hands flies towards Fitoria- <br/>
 <br/>
"KueKueKueKueeeeeeeeeeeee" <br/>
"Kueeeeeeeeeeeee!" <br/>
 <br/>
Firo's magic was enclosed and dissipated like it was never there. <br/>
 <br/>
"Counterbalance?" <br/>
 <br/>
Oh, that's a phenomenon that was described in the beginner class magic book. <br/>
Interfering with magic. However, that is only possible if the user has sufficient power and is able to analyse the magic as it is cast. <br/>
The proper magic system required varies every time. <br/>
It is difficult because the magic cast to counterbalance must be from the proper system, and also must be cast right before the magic hits. <br/>
It is easier to counterbalance high class magic than intermediate class magic due to longer cast times. <br/>
 <br/>
"Wow......Firo's magic is not effective either~" <br/>
 <br/>
Firo charges rapidly Fitoria again. <br/>
Without delay Fitoria strikes at Firo with her massive wings. <br/>
 <br/>
"Ha!" <br/>
 <br/>
With a thud, Firo raised both her wings to catch the colossal attack  <br/>
 <br/>
"Ugh......It's heavy......But" <br/>
 <br/>
After barely withstanding the attack, Firo kicks Fitora's wing away and jumps. <br/>
As expected, Fitoria who had her wing kicked away was not in position to defend against Firo who flew up to her face. <br/>
Thanks to coating herself with wind Firo's jumping power improved. <br/>
 <br/>
"Tei!" <br/>
 <br/>
Firo spun her whole body and unleashed a roundhouse kick at Fitoria's face. <br/>
 <br/>
It should have hit. <br/>
Yet despite all that, <br/>
 <br/>
"Kue!" <br/>
 <br/>
Fitora was also coated with wind, and Firo was blown off into the sky. <br/>
Basaa~! <br/>
Still, Fitoria was slightly grazed and a feather was hit off. <br/>
 <br/>
"Kuee" <br/>
 <br/>
Fitora was watching the feather that Firo hit down with a smile. <br/>
I noticed it. <br/>
Fitoria still has a something besides magic and physical attacks.  There is still something she is hiding. <br/>
She hasn't moved one step either. <br/>
Just how strong is she? <br/>
Legendary Philorial. She certainly lives up to those words. Firo is being taken lightly. <br/>
She has absolutely no chance of winning. <br/>
 <br/>
"Boo......" <br/>
 <br/>
Firo is whining with an ill-humoured expression. <br/>
 <br/>
"I will not lose!" <br/>
 <br/>
All of Firo's feathers start to stand on end. <br/>
 <br/>
"Suuuuu......" <br/>
 <br/>
She takes a giant breath.I see, Firo is absorbing the surrounding magic. <br/>
Such a thing is possible? <br/>
And for nearly 30 seconds she does not move. <br/>
 <br/>
"Ok---" <br/>
 <br/>
Firo flaps her wings. <br/>
Everyone can see that wind magic is being condensed behind her. <br/>
This is most likely Firo's strongest finisher. <br/>
The prerequisite is too severe. It's not usable in actual combat. <br/>
 <br/>
"Here it comes!" <br/>
 <br/>
Firo flies at Fitoria with the speed of a bullet. <br/>
She rotates her beak, by dashing off the ground and flying low. This attack is the fastest by far. <br/>
Usually Firo's attacks consist of basic kicking and pecking. <br/>
What can I say. This attack resembles the finisher from an air-plane shaped robot in a strategy game. <br/>
(Tl note: An anon kindly informed me of what this was referencing. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UxkzaMVj2UE#t=140 ) <br/>
 <br/>
"Kue!?" <br/>
 <br/>
Even Fitoria widened her eyes in surprise. <br/>
With a large step, Firotia takes a step back and...... <br/>
It was over. <br/>
 <br/>
Fitoria stretched both her wings and her expression changed, her posture resembled one killing bugs with both hands, and squishes Firo. <br/>
 <br/>
"Kyu......" <br/>
 <br/>
When Fitoria opens her wings and a knocked-out Firo falls down. <br/>
 <br/>
"Firo-chan!" <br/>
"""Guaaaaaaaa!""" <br/>
 <br/>
The Philorials start cheering. <br/>
We follow after Melty who rushes out first. <br/>
 <br/>
"Are you okay?" <br/>
"Yup......ah......" <br/>
 <br/>
As Melty rushes up to Firo to check on her, Firo looks up at me. <br/>
After looking around restlessly I look down at her. <br/>
 <br/>
"Firo lost." <br/>
"But you did great.You fought well against the Queen of Philorials." <br/>
"She wasn't even trying, Firo couldn't hit her at all." <br/>
 <br/>
As Firo was sulking Firotia called with KueKue. <br/>
 <br/>
"What are you giving me?" <br/>
 <br/>
Oh, we're going to receive something? <br/>
 <br/>
"KueKue" <br/>
"I pass? Pass what?" <br/>
 <br/>
Fitoria pulls off a single piece of her beautiful feather crown and gives it to Firo. <br/>
Suddenly, the feather glows and is attaches itself to Firo's head. <br/>
Then it splits and disperses...... <br/>
On Firo's head is now an ahoge bouncing around. <br/>
 <br/>
"......" <br/>
 <br/>
Raphtalia and I are left speechless. <br/>
What just happened?What was that a reward? <br/>
 <br/>
"Eh?" <br/>
"Firo-chan is so cute!" <br/>
 <br/>
Melty is excitedly admiring Firo while the bird in question doesn't understand what is going on. <br/>
 <br/>
"Did something happen?" <br/>
"Umm......" <br/>
 <br/>
When I point on top of her, Firo timidly touches her head. <br/>
 <br/>
"Something strange grew! No~!" <br/>
 <br/>
Buchin! <br/>
Eh!? <br/>
She yanked it out with all her might. <br/>
 <br/>
"It hurts~!" <br/>
 <br/>
Firo is delighted about getting rid of the ahoge, but is also in pain. <br/>
Pyokon! <br/>
However, from where it was pulled out another ahoge appears. <br/>
 <br/>
"It grew again!" <br/>
"Ehh!?" <br/>
 <br/>
With watery eyes Firo sadly gave up on removing the ahoge after pulling it out several times. <br/>
Well, the ahoge isn't that bad. <br/>
 <br/>
"Kue Kue" <br/>
"You're terrible~!" <br/>
"What did she say?" <br/>
"Give up on pulling it because it will always grow back." <br/>
"Kue Kue" <br/>
"Eh......So its become like that......" <br/>
 <br/>
Firo looks at Fitoria's feather crown. <br/>
What on earth did this legendary Philorial pass down to Firo? <br/>
I swiftly check Firo's status screen. <br/>
 <br/>
......Her abilities have improved from before. <br/>
 <br/>
Perhaps, this is divine protection or something like a correction ability. <br/>
It's a good reward for Firo who is unable to level up. <br/>
 <br/>
"Kue Kue" <br/>
 <br/>
Fitora points at me and beckons me with a Kui Kui. <br/>
 <br/>
"It's a gift for master." <br/>
"I don't need an ahoge." <br/>
"Ahoge?" <br/>
 <br/>
I'd rather not explain. If I tell her she'll annoy me about it. <br/>
 <br/>
"Kue Kue" <br/>
"She said it's even better." <br/>
"Hmmm......" <br/>
 <br/>
I don't know what it is, but I hope it's nothing strange. <br/>
I can't really refuse, so I approach. <br/>
 <br/>
"Kue Kue" <br/>
 <br/>
Fitoria points at my shield and gestures upwards. <br/>
 <br/>
"Like this?" <br/>
 <br/>
I lift up my shield. Fitoria pulls out another crown feather and puts it on the shield. <br/>
The shield has a huge reaction and absorbs it. <br/>
 <br/>
All of the the Philorial series has been unsealed. <br/>
 <br/>
"What?" <br/>
 <br/>
I check the skill tree and confirm that all of the Philorial shields are lit up and active. <br/>
Most of them are basic ability and equipment bonuses, there are Speed Ups too,  Philorial ability correction,  Growth Correction (Big Middle Small), Growth○○Correction (Big Middle Small) there are also shields received that I cannot wear. <br/>
What stands out is, Riding ability Up (Big Middle Small). <br/>
However, there are a lot of shields I cannot use since my level is insufficient. <br/>
It is nice to have unlocked all the Philo Rial shields though.  <br/>
 <br/>
"I am extremely grateful." <br/>
"Kue Kue" <br/>
 <br/>
Fitoria nodded while smiling. <br/>
I was given quite an amazing reward. <br/>
Are the powers of Philorials condensed into that feather? <br/>
This is also very helpful since Firo cannot Level. <br/>
 <br/>
That reminds me, Melty said that in the legends the Queen of Philorials fought together with heroes. <br/>
Is Fitoria the origin of the legend of the holy bird? <br/>
Does that mean Fitoriea gave me her feather because she understands how the hero's weapon works? <br/>
 <br/>
"Kue" <br/>
"I have finished my business here so I will take my leave." <br/>
"Ah, Umm......" <br/>
 <br/>
Melty timidly calls out to Fitoria. <br/>
 <br/>
"Kue?" <br/>
"Please shake my hand!" <br/>
 <br/>
It is Melty's cherished wish to meet and befriend the legendary Philorial so she pleas excitedly. <br/>
For a handshake...... Are you meeting an idol or an athlete? <br/>
 <br/>
"Kue Kue" <br/>
 <br/>
Fitoria was dumbfounded for a few seconds before she stroked melty's head with her large wings. <br/>
And she was embraced kindly with a smile. <br/>
Melty sunk quite deep into Fitoria's bossom. <br/>
 <br/>
"Wow......" <br/>
  <br/>
It seems Melty has also received a large service and was placed on top of Fitoria's head. <br/>
 <br/>
"So high!" <br/>
 <br/>
Melty is extremely thrilled. <br/>
Fitoria tells us to get back, and as we fall back. <br/>
She expands to twice her size......18 meters. <br/>
That's as big as a building already. <br/>
 <br/>
"This is amazing!" <br/>
 <br/>
Melty's voice could be heard in the distance. Isn't that a bit too high? <br/>
Can this still be considered a Philorial? Just how much can it grow? <br/>
No, this form or it's 9 meter form should be it's orignal size, she is probably transforming. <br/>
......Will Firo become that big too? <br/>
I look at Firo suspiciously. <br/>
 <br/>
"What's up?" <br/>
"Nothing." <br/>
 <br/>
If you seriously grow that big......it'll be quite a problem. <br/>
To sustain that size the food expense would be astronomical. <br/>
Fitoria lives in the wild. Moreover, she's the genuine queen of the group. In those conditions eating regardless of amount would be fine. <br/>
But Firo is a pet Philorial. I have to take care of her. <br/>
Should I reuse the Bio Plants? <br/>
 <br/>
After Melty and Fitoria finished played, Fitoria changed back into form of a usual Philorial that pulled the luxurious carriage and shook Melt's hand. <br/>
 <br/>
"You see. I have an old oath, I can only say words of parting to humans." <br/>
"I see." <br/>
 <br/>
I wonder if this is just courtesy. <br/>
 <br/>
"See ya-" <br/>
"Eh!?" <br/>
 <br/>
That voice is the same as Firo's! That bird! <br/>
I mean she can even speak in the figure of a normal Philorial? <br/>
The Philorials surrounding us scattered when Firoria disappeared. <br/>
 <br/>
"Ha......" <br/>
 <br/>
Melty sighed while seemingly enchanted. <br/>
 <br/>
"That was dreamlike......" <br/>
"It was a good dream." <br/>
 <br/>
I feel that was a monster that is capable of Armageddon. <br/>
To effortlessly toy with Firo who has the strength to kick around a dragon. <br/>
Anyway, I am looking forward to how much Firo has powered up. <br/>
Our journey South West continues.
