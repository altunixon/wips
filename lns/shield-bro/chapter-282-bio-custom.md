Chapter 282: Bio Custom<br/>
"Fake~"<br/>
"W-what exactly is this…"<br/>
The Raph race specimen continues repeating this line. The fake is dumbfound.<br/>
Hmph! This is the special function I installed into the Raph race.<br/>
A psychological ploy against the fake.<br/>
By the way, I haven’t gotten around to teaching it any other words yet.<br/>
"Fake~"<br/>
"… Is this supposed to be some form of harassment?" (Raphtalia)<br/>
"Who knows? It seems that Naofumi was trying to revive Raphtalia-chan when he made this child." (Sadina)<br/>
"How…?" (Raphtalia)<br/>
"With a strand of your hair." (Sadina)<br/>
"Naofumi-sama—–!" (Raphtalia)<br/>
With a face that seems like it would burst into tears at any second, the fake cries out.<br/>
Fufufu, the mental attack was super effective.<br/>
"And this is a message from Naofumi-chan." (Sadina)<br/>
Sadina takes out the video crystal and presents it to the fake.<br/>
"It’s been a few hours, fake and traitors. Good job getting the order of my defense towers correct. Shall I praise you for that?" (Naofumi)<br/>
After a brief pause, my image continues.<br/>
"However, don’t think you will be getting here so easily. At dawn, when I have revived Raphtalia, I’ll make mincemeat out of all of you. Be prepared." (Naofumi)<br/>
"Ah… How should I react to this…" (Raphtalia)<br/>
The fake puts her hands on her head.<br/>
"I explained the situation to Melty-chan, and she said she would cover up the situation, but…" (Sadina)<br/>
"The next time you try to invade, I’ll go all out as well. Don’t think it’ll ever be as easy as it was tonight. Then farewell, fakes!" (Naofumi)<br/>
And my video terminates.<br/>
"And like that, we’ve been sent to deliver the message. If you try to attack Naofumi-chan’s fortress again, we’ll shoot you out of the sky." (Sadina)<br/>
"… I see. So do we have to fight Sadina-oneechan here as well?" (Raphtalia)<br/>
"Yeah, if I don’t fight, Naofumi-chan will get mad at me." (Sadina)<br/>
"… Understood. Then let’s fight." (Raphtalia)<br/>
The fake tightens the grip on her weapon and rushes at Sadina.<br/>
Sadina is at a disadvantage, as she fights while defending the Raph specimen. But she puts up a good fight.<br/>
But why isn’t she using magic?<br/>
When I asked later, she said that it would put the Raph in danger. I’ll accept such a reason.<br/>
Motoyasu exchanges blows with Ren, Itsuki, Rishia, and the opposing Filo Rials.<br/>
"Trying to win with numbers won’t get you anywhere!"<br/>
「Windmill!」<br/>
Motoyasu spins his spear and creates a tornado.<br/>
But because of the Skill’s cooldown time, and the fact he was fighting the long ranged experts, Itsuki and Rishia, he gradually gets pushed back.<br/>
"Motoyasu-san, we’re at a disadvantage! Let’s retreat." (Midori)<br/>
After taking blows repeatedly, Midori calls out to Motoyasu.<br/>
"But, I cannot betray Father-in-Law’s expectations." (Motoyasu)<br/>
"We’ve fulfilled our objective. If we fight here and lose, then all will be meaningless!" (Midori)<br/>
"I-I see. But I haven’t convinced my lovely angels to switch sides yet." (Motoyasu)<br/>
"It’s impossible! As long as Piyo-chan is here, they won’t listen to our invitations." (Midori)<br/>
"Uu… I apologize, Father-in-Law. I, Motoyasu, will retreat for everyone’s sake!" (Motoyasu)<br/>
"Ah, wait! Where’s Gaelion? We need to take down the Anti-Teleport barrier…" (Midori)<br/>
"Rafu~!"<br/>
The Raph uses illusion magic to erase its own presence. At the same time, it creates illusionary copies of Motoyasu and the others.<br/>
The fake saw through it almost immediately, but the spell is able to buy enough time.<br/>
Motoyasu, his three and Sadina are able to take the Raph and escape out of the extent of the Anti-Teleport zone.<br/>
"And that’s what happened, Father-in-Law. I offer my greatest apologies." (Motoyasu)<br/>
I saw the footage from the Memory Crystal I had Motoyasu carry.<br/>
"The results were satisfactory. It seems they truly intend to oppose us. They’re a group we must eliminate if we wish to conquer the world." (Naofumi)<br/>
There’s still some time before the barrier around the second tower breaks… I’ll increase our forces before that.<br/>
And my first day of lab construction concludes like that.<br/>
The second day.<br/>
I begin my preparations to mass produce the Raph race.<br/>
I’m still doubtful as to whether they’ll be that great of an asset, but having them is better than not.<br/>
Who should I send to defend the second tower?<br/>
Motoyasu is reliable, but he’ll be at a disadvantage when taking on everyone by himself.<br/>
I should probably send Atlas, Firo, and Fohl as well.<br/>
Even so… I have my doubts.<br/>
Even if they’re rotten, they’re heroes with their parties.<br/>
"Niichan! Is the crepe tree done yet?" (Kiel)<br/>
"Ah, Kiel. I’ll do it later. I’m still busy." (Naofumi)<br/>
"I see…" (Kiel)<br/>
Kiel wakes me when I was taking a short nap in the laboratory.<br/>
Under my arm, Atlas is happily sleeping.<br/>
Fohl is also asleep.<br/>
"What will you be doing today?" (Kiel)<br/>
"Ah, today, I plan to make a powerful weapon to ready myself to defeat that fake army." (Naofumi)<br/>
"Ara? You’re planning some interesting things." (Sadina)<br/>
Sadina, who was asleep in a corner of the room, gets up and joins the conversation.<br/>
"What sort of thing are you planning?" (Sadina)<br/>
"I’ll modify the monsters and create a powerful one." (Naofumi)<br/>
"Oh~! Amazing~!" (Kiel)<br/>
"There are quite a few monsters here, so there are quite a few things that I have to do." (Naofumi)<br/>
To make a body for Raphtalia, the Shield told me I need to study the bodies of various monsters as well.<br/>
Monsters have overflowing vitality, and there are a few that can continue functioning as undeads even after death.<br/>
Gaelion is a good example.<br/>
If I study that, I’ll be able to improve my Raphs. I’ll be able to get closer and closer to the original.<br/>
Also, I promised the monsters. That I would make them strong.<br/>
As I was thinking along those lines, the monster Rat cared for dearly started banging on the walls of its container.<br/>
I think she called it Mii-kun or something.<br/>
I took the research lab as is, so I guess he was here the whole time.<br/>
"Hmm? What’s up?" (Naofumi)<br/>
I can’t really tell what he’s thinking, but I can at least read his expression.<br/>
"You want me to use you?" (Naofumi)<br/>
Rat’s monster nods with conviction.<br/>
"Fumu…" (Naofumi)<br/>
He is a monster that wished to be strong.<br/>
I guess that’s fine.<br/>
"You have the resolve to go through all sorts of experiments… right?" (Naofumi)<br/>
Upon my words, Rat’s monster nods.<br/>
Good.<br/>
I press my Shield to the cultivation tank containing the monster, and I flip a switch.<br/>
The effect I activate is Ability Bonus: Bio Custom, Alchemic correction, and also…. Gene Modification.<br/>
Geometric Symbols and letters fly out, wrapping aound Rat’s precious monster.<br/>
… Strengthening it is all about imagination.<br/>
What sort of strength is he seeking? That’s the most important.<br/>
Even though he isn’t human, I shouldn’t do any modifications he doesn’t personally wish for.<br/>
"Now then, imagine what you wish to become. I’ll assist you to the best of my ability." (Naofumi)<br/>
Rat’s monster nods once more, and its ideal image enters my mind.<br/>
… Well then.<br/>
Rat wanted to make a monster like a dragon, with overwhelming vitality. One that wouldn’t die easily.<br/>
That will has perfectly transferred itself to her precious specimen.<br/>
Perhaps their hearts are linked in some way.<br/>
However… This is a bit over the physical capacity of this monster.<br/>
If modifications exceed a monster’s capacity, then my Human Experimentation and Gene Modification capabilities don’t work.<br/>
In that aspect, the Bioplants have an extremely large capacity.<br/>
Of course, to activate it, a large amount of magic and SP is consumed. But with the Shield’s recovery ability, if I rest a bit, it will replenish on its own.<br/>
That’s just how high my current level is.<br/>
What should I do…<br/>
"Sorry, but please lower your expectations a bit. Otherwise…" (Naofumi)<br/>
Rat’s monster stares at me and conveys its strong will.<br/>
Well, if I do a slightly lower modification, there are still other ways of strengthening it.<br/>
I edit the image Rat’s monster sent me, lowering it a bit, before presenting it back to the monster.<br/>
This much is quite possible.<br/>
Luckily, I already have all of the necessary materials in my Shield. Though some of them are a bit rare.<br/>
"I see… So this is the strength you long for? Show me that you can withstand any pain, any curse, any suffering to attain this strength!" (Naofumi)<br/>
I activate the Gene Modification.<br/>
The modification will take a bit of time.<br/>
Something bangs against the walls of the Culture Tank, and the water in it churns violently.<br/>
"Oh… wait, how long is this going to last?" (Kiel)<br/>
"It’ll take a while." (Naofumi)<br/>
"I see…" (Kiel)<br/>
I take out Magic Water and Spirit Water from my shield to recover my SP and Mana.<br/>
"Let’s move on to the next task." (Naofumi)<br/>
Rat’s monster needs further modifications… I start framing the components.<br/>
I made it so that the monster will live in a sort of core and can be transplanted into different bodies.<br/>
For its first body, I do large modifications on a First Generation Raph body.<br/>
The current body I’m making is 3 meters in height.<br/>
A Raph even larger than Firo floats in the tank in front of me.<br/>
It’s the body Rat’s monster will inhabit.<br/>
Eventually the modifications finish, and Rat’s monster shows its new form.<br/>
It’s a red… round crystal.<br/>
Rat’s monster has evolved to one that controls a body from a core.<br/>
In order to act as a vessel for that core, I made this giant Raph.<br/>
I take up Rat’s monster and transplant it into the Raph.<br/>
The body shakes for a while, but eventually, they synchronize. The Raph opens its eyes and lifts its arm.<br/>
Fumu… It should be able to move like this.<br/>
I press a switch and drain the fluid from the tank. I remove the monster from it.<br/>
"Rafu~"<br/>
"How is it, your new body? When my research progresses further, I’ll grant you one that’s easier to fight in." (Naofumi)<br/>
"Rafu~!"<br/>
"Amazing! Niichan can even do things like this!" (Kiel)<br/>
"Isn’t it obvious." (Naofumi)<br/>
"… Naofumi-chan is amazing. He’s the alchemist of the century." (Sadina)<br/>
"Perhaps I’m of that caliber." (Naofumi)<br/>
"Master, good morning~!" (Firo)<br/>
Firo trods into the laboratory in a good mood.<br/>
Did she wake up and go to the Dining Hall already? Her stomach is swelling out a bit.<br/>
"Who is that?" (Firo)<br/>
Firo points at the large Raph and turns to me.<br/>
"It’s Rat’s monster." (Naofumi)<br/>
"Ah, so this is Mii-kun?" (Firo)<br/>
"Rafu~"<br/>
As Firo waves at it, the monster known as Mii-kun returns the wave.<br/>
"He’s become large and cute now. Firo won’t lose." (Firo)<br/>
"Rafu~"<br/>
"Now then, I have an important mission to give you." (Naofumi)<br/>
"What~?" (Firo)<br/>
"Go protect the second tower with this one." (Naofumi)<br/>
"Yes~!" (Firo)<br/>
"Well, there’s still a bit of time. Go accompany this monster until it gets accustomed to its new body." (Naofumi)<br/>
"Got it!" (Firo)<br/>
It’s not like I strengthened that body too far.<br/>
It’s like a disposable shell.<br/>
I’ll need to upgrade it to something that will become its main body later.<br/>
I explained all of that body’s working functions, so… it should be fine.<br/>
