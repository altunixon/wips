Chapter 141: To Capture the Spear Hero<br/>
"Elena! Thank god. You’re alive!" (Motoyasu)<br/>
Upon hearing of The Spear’s companion’s discovery, we head to her location only to Find Motoyasu hugging Woman 1 and shouting in a loud voice over the counter of the receptions desk of a store. It seems that Woman 1 is manning the desk. It gives off a feeling of a parent being reunited with their child.<br/>
Elena? did she have a name like that?<br/>
I don’t recall asking for her or Woman 2’s names back on Cal Mira.<br/>
"Ah, if it isn’t the Hero of the Spear." (Woman 1)<br/>
Woman 1 takes on an oppressive attitude and answers Motoyasu indifferently.<br/>
Motoyasu lets out a bewildered voice.<br/>
"W-what’s wrong?" (Motoyasu)<br/>
"Wrong? Now what could possibly be wrong?" (Woman 1)<br/>
"You know, I was really worried." (Motoyasu)<br/>
"I did nothing warranting your worry. I’m more surprised that you managed to survive." (Woman 1)<br/>
"Isn’t it obvious? There’s no way I would die with you guys there to support me." (Motoyasu)<br/>
Motoyasu answers with quite a bit of enthusiasm.<br/>
However, the aura around Woman 1 only seems to get colder.<br/>
Her gaze is apathetic. It’s as if she is staring at a pile of garbage.<br/>
"Naofumi-sama, are you not going to capture them?" (Rafatalia)<br/>
"Wait, let’s observe the situation." (Naofumi)<br/>
I think something interesting is about to happen.<br/>
And as long as Motoyasu hasn’t noticed us, we have the upper hand.<br/>
"-?" (Firo)<br/>
Firo would stand out in her monster form, so she is currently assuming her human one.<br/>
We are observing the affair from an alley outside the store.<br/>
"Let’s once again team up to save the world!" (Motoyasu)<br/>
"I’m sorry. It seems I will be inheriting my father’s business. I can’t go with you any longer." (Woman 1)<br/>
Her voice is quite indifferent.<br/>
It seems she has no intention of listening to Motoyasu at all.<br/>
Motoyasu seems to understand this as well. He looks quite confused.<br/>
I bet everything had gone his way up until this point.<br/>
I envy him in that aspect.<br/>
Even though I’ve become a count and acquired some land, for some reason I’ve been stuck cooking and babysitting for my slaves.<br/>
I feel as if I’m their mother.<br/>
I can hear the soldiers calling me the Hero of the Kitchen behind my back.<br/>
(TL: He actually says this, I’m not taking it from the comments)<br/>
To be more specific:<br/>
"As expected, the Hero of the Kitchen’s food really is magnificent." (Soldier)<br/>
"You’re being rude, he’s the Hero of the Shield… right?" (Other Soldier)<br/>
"Ah, right… But recently, his shield has started to look like a pot lid to me…" (Soldier)<br/>
"I think you need medical attention." (Other Soldier)<br/>
"Hahaha" (Soldier)<br/>
To hell with Pot Lids.<br/>
Remember this. I’ll work you especially hard when building gets under way.<br/>
… well that doesn’t really matter now.<br/>
I need to focus on Motoyasu<br/>
"Hey, really, what happened? You’re different from the usual Elena." (Motoyasu)<br/>
"Even if you ask me that… You know this is a good time. Let me say it." (Woman 1)<br/>
"What?" (Motoyasu)<br/>
"Motoyasu… No, Hero of the Spear-sama. I’m at my limit. I can no longer work with you." (Woman 1)<br/>
"W-what are you saying?" (Motoyasu)<br/>
"At the start, you had a good reputation, and quite a bit of money. Look at you now. What do you have?" (Woman 1)<br/>
"Hm? I’m still a hero…" (Motoyasu)<br/>
"Honestly, I’m tired of being your comrade. Sick of it." (Woman 1)<br/>
"W-what part of me is the problem?" (Motoyasu)<br/>
"You always try to hit on women, you don’t understand a female’s heart, and you only focus on your strength parameters." (Woman 1)<br/>
Motoyasu’s hot-blooded personality has diminished.<br/>
Has he never been dumped before?<br/>
This is bad. I’m starting to smile at his misfortune.<br/>
"Naofumi-sama. You’re smiling." (Rafatalia)<br/>
"But… I mean look. Motoyasu’s face has turned blue." (Naofumi)<br/>
"Shouldn’t you be trying to capture them now?" (Rafatalia)<br/>
"Wait a second. I want to watch for a bit more." (Naofumi)<br/>
Woman 1 has stopped hiding her thoughts and has begun talking rapidly.<br/>
"If you have enough free time to hit on me, then go to the castle and turn yourself in." (Woman 1)<br/>
"Gu…" (Motoyasu)<br/>
It seems that he does realize his own crimes. Motoyasu remains silent.<br/>
"You’re already finished. If you want me back so badly, then go get some status. Like the Hero of the Shield." (Woman 1)<br/>
Woman 1 gives a rejection reminiscent of a character archetype that I hate.<br/>
She’s speaking as if she hasn’t done anything wrong, and that everything is Motoyasu’s fault.<br/>
If the Heroine of a Gal-ge did that, the company’s building would be in flames.<br/>
But why is it?<br/>
When these words are directed at Motoyasu, I feel an extreme rush of happiness.<br/>
"Naofumi-sama!" (Rafatalia)<br/>
Rafatalia is angry.<br/>
It seems I cannot observe the situation any longer.<br/>
"Then, shall we go?" (Naofumi)<br/>
I exit the alley and walk towards Motoyasu.<br/>
"W-what happened to you. I was sure you were more of an amiable sort of person." (Motoyasu)<br/>
"Even if you ask me that…" (Woman 1)<br/>
Motoyasu is too engrossed in the conversation to notice my approach.<br/>
This is my chance.<br/>
"Hey, tell me this isn’t so." (Motoyasu)<br/>
"I’m very serious, now leave already." (Woman 1)<br/>
Woman 1 notices me getting closer.<br/>
It seems she understands the circumstances to some extent.<br/>
Please stall him for just a little bit longer…<br/>
When I wonder if my message gets across, she gives a quick wink in my direction. For some reason, it looks quite natural.<br/>
"And so, I am absolutely done with you. If you don’t give up already, I’ll report you." (Woman 1)<br/>
It seems Woman 1 truly has had it with Motoyasu.<br/>
She’s even assisting in his capture.<br/>
Well, if she doesn’t do so, she will probably be treated as a conspirator in breaking the Spirit Turtle’s seal.<br/>
For argument’s sake, it seems that the Spirit Turtle was set to awaken at some point during the wave.<br/>
But to willingly release it is still quite a crime.<br/>
I’m almost there. Just a little bit closer…<br/>
Damn… This one’s instincts are not to be underestimated.<br/>
"Na-Naofumi!?" (Motoyasu)<br/>
"Yo. You understand what me being here means, right?" (Naofumi)<br/>
"…Elena, did you sell me out!?" (Motoyasu)<br/>
"You say some hurtful things. I am an ally to those with power. I was back then, and I am now." (Woman 1)<br/>
I can hear nothing but a villain.<br/>
If I were Motoyasu, I would have forgotten my crimes and stabbed her by now.<br/>
"Now, obediently get captured. The Hero of the Shield did that at well. It may be best for you to start from scratch." (Woman 1)<br/>
"E-Elena… You!" (Motoyasu)<br/>
I don’t think her intentions are as bad as Bitch. But they’re both still trash in my eyes.<br/>
Motoyasu doesn’t intend to give up without a fight. He takes up his spear.<br/>
Do you plan on fighting in such a crowded area?<br/>
"I want to hear your story. Will you accompany me to the castle?" (Naofumi)<br/>
"I’m sorry, but I won’t go with you. I need to go and prove my own innocence." (Motoyasu)<br/>
"Innocence, huh? Well, I don’t have the slightest intention of killing you. Right now, we’re looking for a way to push back the wave, like the time we gained with the Spirit Turtle incident. As I’ve said before, I’m only an expert on defense. I cannot hurt you." (Naofumi)<br/>
"I’m not the culprit!" (Motoyasu)<br/>
"Listen to a person when they are talking to you." (Naofumi)<br/>
"I’m going to find my comrades, and save the World!" (Motoyasu)<br/>
"And what I’m saying is… Ah, this is a pain!" (Naofumi)<br/>
Anyways, the culprit always says that they’re innocent.<br/>
But judging from Motoyasu’s reaction, he himself believes that he is not the cause.<br/>
Which would make the culprit either Ren or Itsuki.<br/>
No, it seems all three of them were in the same place at the time. There’s no way he’s not involved at all.<br/>
"Anyways, stop by the castle. If you’re not the culprit,then you have no reason to refuse." (Naofumi)<br/>
"I refuse!" (Motoyasu)<br/>
"You know, you did the same thing to me right? But now that our positions are switched, you act like that? Is there some sort of reason preventing you from going like there was in my case?" (Naofumi)<br/>
"Nope!" (Motoyasu)<br/>
"You…" (Naofumi)<br/>
"But there’s no way I can let myself get captured here!" (Motoyasu)<br/>
I can’t talk with this man. For now, it seems I must restrain him by force.<br/>
Can I defeat him with my stats reduced to this level?<br/>
No, Rafatalia and Firo are here. It should be fine.<br/>
From what I see, Motoyasu is alone.<br/>
"Please turn yourself in." (Rafatalia)<br/>
"Wha-?" (Motoyasu)<br/>
The ones who appeared are Rafatalia, and Firo in her monster form.<br/>
It’s 3 on 1… What will Woman 1 do?<br/>
"Shall I join you?" (Woman 1)<br/>
It seems she will assist us in capturing Motoyasu.<br/>
Her level should probably be around 70-80.<br/>
Her skills should be more than enough.<br/>
"Now then. It’s time for you to pay the Piper, Motoyasu." (Naofumi)<br/>
(TL: Literally, Time to pay the land tax, Time to reap what you sow.)<br/>
"Don’t rampage too much. It will be troublesome if we break the store’s merchandise." (Woman 1)<br/>
As we approach, Motoyasu begins to Spin his Spear in a large circle.<br/>
「Portal Spear!」<br/>
Motoyasu’s figure seems to bend in space.<br/>
What the hell!?<br/>
And in an instant, he vanishes completely.<br/>
Is it a skill? It probably teleported him to a set location.<br/>
Damn, I miscalculated.<br/>
In MMOs, Items that allowed you to teleport to a saved location or town usually existed.<br/>
And Motoyasu had found the skill to do it.<br/>
"He Ran!" (Naofumi)<br/>
Damn… It seems that capturing a hero will be more difficult that it seems.<br/>
I’ll have to do something before he uses the skill, or find some place or magic that will interfere with its activation.<br/>
"H-he vanished… Where could he have gone?" (Rafatalia)<br/>
"Who knows." (Naofumi)<br/>
If it’s to a set location, he’s probably at the Dragon’s hourglass, but if he himself can set the location, then the possibilities are endless.<br/>
How convenient. Teach it to me.<br/>
I don’t know how effective it is, but a warp skill will be priceless while peddling.<br/>
I don’t know if the effect is limited to me, or if I can take along comrades, but either way it seems really useful.<br/>
If I set my village as the warp point, it will make movement easier, and if any trouble arises I can be there in an instant.<br/>
I should probably ask Woman 1 if Motoyasu told her anything about it later.<br/>
"Well then, it’s been quite a while." (Naofumi)<br/>
"It sure has." (Woman 1)<br/>
I address Woman 1. Her real name was Elena… I think.<br/>
"You’ve probably already told the people at the castle, but would you mind sharing your story with me?" (Naofumi)<br/>
"I understand." (Woman 1)<br/>
Elena takes a deep sigh, and begins speaking.<br/>
