Meteor Attack~ <br/>
 <br/>
Chapter 52 <br/>
 <br/>
Grow Up <br/>
 <br/>
"It should be around here......I think" <br/>
"I think so too" <br/>
"Yup" <br/>
 <br/>
A big wine red crack is spreading from the ground, and is the foundation of the wave. <br/>
One after another demons crawl out from there. <br/>
 <br/>
"Hm?" <br/>
 <br/>
There is a fish-like ghost that is pure white, has red eyes, a big wide mouth with fangs, and a brutal countenance. <br/>
But, it's lying down. <br/>
Did the big game from the waves already die? <br/>
It's very ghost-like...... There is a feeling that physical attacks will not work on this demon. <br/>
 <br/>
"A fish?" <br/>
"What the hell is this......" <br/>
"Hmm...... This doesn't look like too difficult of an enemy." <br/>
"You think so?" <br/>
"Normal attacks won't be effective. Only magic should have an effect." <br/>
 <br/>
There is knowledge from net games about requiring magic attacks. <br/>
 <br/>
"Then Firo can fight!" <br/>
"Huh? Won't a kick not work?" <br/>
"Yup. Firo, can also use attack magic?" <br/>
"Say that from the beginning!" <br/>
"Noo. Kicking is faster than magic." <br/>
 <br/>
Sigh...... Firo does not understand how useful magic can be. <br/>
Asking the person in question for answers is like trying to grasp clouds. <br/>
 <br/>
"Did those guys beat the boss?" <br/>
 <br/>
Where are they? <br/>
As I look around restlessly there are sounds of clashing metal. <br/>
 <br/>
"Over there?" <br/>
"You're right. Let's go over there" <br/>
 <br/>
Firo also hears it, so we run towards the direction of the sound. <br/>
 <br/>
"Rinbu Rei no Kata ・Gyaku Shiki Setsugekka!" <br/>
(Tl note: I am not translating the name of attacks, unless you want something like Circular Dance Model Zero ・ Reverse of Sub Zero Flowers.) <br/>
 <br/>
The sky that is stained with red starts to shine. <br/>
When I look up there is a red moon that looks like it was cast by an antagonist. <br/>
Then, something in the form of a person drew a circle through it and then there was a red flash. <br/>
 <br/>
"""Guaaaaaaaaa!""" <br/>
 <br/>
We arrived as simultaneous screams erupted. <br/>
Motoyasu, Ren, and Ituski are trapped within a tornado, whole their companions are collapsed all over the place. <br/>
 <br/>
"Guha!" <br/>
 <br/>
What on earth happened here? <br/>
From what I can tell the enemy fired off a huge magic attack at this place. <br/>
No, no, these guys should be considerably high levelled. They shouldn't have been defeated so easily. <br/>
But, What is going on? <br/>
Motoyasu was tossed near us. <br/>
 <br/>
"Meteor Spear should have hit......" <br/>
 <br/>
Ren mutters in response to Motoyasu. <br/>
 <br/>
"Metoer Sword should have worked......" <br/>
 <br/>
And Itsuki. <br/>
 <br/>
"Meteor Bow should have done something......" <br/>
(Tlnote: 流星弓,流星剣,流星槍 10/10 naming sense.) <br/>
What? <br/>
 <br/>
"......Do you guys want to be popular?" <br/>
 <br/>
The heroes have all fainted. Well, I think they aren't dead yet. <br/>
Meteor...... is that hip? <br/>
 <br/>
"Are you their reinforcements?" <br/>
 <br/>
After the tornado stops a person appears from the centre. <br/>
This fellow is wearing a jet black kimono with silver embroidery, it feels like clothes that are to be worn during a funeral back in my world. <br/>
There stood a beautiful girl. Her face in no way inferior to Raphtalia. <br/>
Her personality seems serious, and her hair is long. <br/>
But, something is off. Sometimes, she looks slightly translucent, just like a ghost. <br/>
Her weapon is an iron fan. holding an iron fan with both hands, seems like a dance. <br/>
This human shaped woman seems to be victor here. <br/>
 <br/>
"The heroes of this world seem to be all bark and no bite, quite a disappointment." <br/>
 <br/>
That......human shaped woman declares as she turns around. <br/>
 <br/>
"Master~, this person is very strong." <br/>
 <br/>
Firo informs me while all the feathers on her body stand on end. <br/>
 <br/>
"Yes, I feel a strong pressure here. This strength is far from a normal demon." <br/>
 <br/>
Raphtalia also warns me while her tail is standing up. <br/>
 <br/>
"So you defeated these fools?" <br/>
 <br/>
I step on the fucking woman's unconscious face while asking. <br/>
 <br/>
"Hmm...... Is that how you treat your companions?" <br/>
 <br/>
It seems the woman in the kimono does not like my attitude. <br/>
 <br/>
"I apologize, but you can't be any more incorrect about her being my companion." <br/>
 <br/>
After trampling her face about 3 more times my anger is a little appeased. <br/>
 <br/>
"Doesn't matter, what you are doing is unjust." <br/>
"Speaking of unjust, this bitch has done far crueller acts. I have quite a grudge." <br/>
"Master is like a villain~" <br/>
"Shut up" <br/>
"I do not have a just argument for the enemy......" <br/>
 <br/>
Raphtalia is a little amazed as she mutters. <br/>
The gallery is being annoying. <br/>
 <br/>
"Can Firo do that too?" <br/>
 <br/>
Firo raises her foot and aims it at Motoyasu. <br/>
 <br/>
"Stop it, if you do it he will die." <br/>
"Okay~" <br/>
 <br/>
The enemy seems a little amazed at our attitude. <br/>
 <br/>
"......Although they are not your companions, your actions are not that of a just human's." <br/>
"Say whatever you like" <br/>
"Well, I lost in this world, but I cannot leave." <br/>
 <br/>
The enemy charges with her iron fan. <br/>
That's fast! <br/>
I raise my shield at once. <br/>
Gagin! <br/>
Damn......That's very heavy. <br/>
Even the zombie dragon did not have so much weight behind it's attacks. <br/>
Such a heavy attack from an iron fan, it would seriously be dangerous if Raphtalia or Firo took one of these. <br/>
 <br/>
"Raphtalia, Firo! Be careful......She's strong." <br/>
"Okay!" <br/>
"Sure!" <br/>
 <br/>
"I am the Hero of the shield who deciphers and calls forth the power of nature to defend!" <br/>
"Fast Guard!" <br/>
 <br/>
After I cast support magic on all three of us, the fight begins. <br/>
The opponent grasped my intention so she changed locations. We chased. <br/>
So that other heroes and their companions would not wake up and interfere. <br/>
She probably took down the boss of the wave too. <br/>
I receive painful wounds from the iron fan whenever I receive an attack anywhere besides my shield. <br/>
Whenever I have some room I cast heal on myself, but this is very intense. <br/>
Her attacks are not only quick, they are also extremely strong. <br/>
She tried to change her aim to Raphtalia and Firo but I prevent her. <br/>
 <br/>
"As if I'd let you!" <br/>
 <br/>
So to obstruct her I pulled her leg. <br/>
 <br/>
"Ugh......Release me immediately!" <br/>
 <br/>
However, you cannot remove my restraints with something like that. <br/>
 <br/>
"Are you the same combat type?......This is more troublesome than those people before." <br/>
 <br/>
The enemy remains nonchalant even after being subjected to Snake's Poison Fang (Intermediate). <br/>
As for her defence, I had to put that under serious reconsideration after she blocked an attack from Raphtalia and Firo. <br/>
In any chase, she's strong. In everything. <br/>
The fact that the other heroes got defeated is proof enough. <br/>
 <br/>
"Master, Watch Firo's magic~" <br/>
 <br/>
Firo crosses her left hand over her right, and rushes towards the enemy. <br/>
 <br/>
"Here I come~" <br/>
 <br/>
For a moment, yes only a moment, Firo turned into a blur. <br/>
GeshiGeshiGeshiGeshiGeshi! <br/>
A shock that vibrates from impact is felt through the enemy. <br/>
 <br/>
"Damn......!" <br/>
 <br/>
The enemy has a face full of agony. <br/>
 <br/>
"Seriously...... this person is so obstinate. To receive Firo's attack and not fly away." <br/>
"such a heavy attack...... It's strength rival's that of the Hero of the Sword. To kick me that heavily eith times in an instant......" <br/>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <br/>
Eh? You can see Firo's attacks? <br/>
 <br/>
"Firo, do it again!" <br/>
"Eh......Impossible, My magic power is exhausted and it takes time to prepare." <br/>
 <br/>
Was that Firo's sure kill attack? <br/>
 <br/>
"Eat this!" <br/>
 <br/>
Raphtalia pierces the opening. <br/>
 <br/>
"Naive!" <br/>
 <br/>
The iron fan intercept the sword at the last moment. <br/>
Bakin! <br/>
 <br/>
"Wh-" <br/>
 <br/>
Raphtalia's sword broke? <br/>
Just how much strength does she have. Originally iron fans can break swords, but that requires complete mastery. <br/>
Even though I applied Fast Guard, I am barely able to block with my shield. <br/>
And Firo has already used her trump card. <br/>
 <br/>
"Damn......" <br/>
 <br/>
Rapthalia backs off and pulls out a spare. <br/>
Is there any way to win...... <br/>
 <br/>
"Huff.....Huff......That's quite enough." <br/>
 <br/>
No, we may have a chance if this becomes a battle of attrition. <br/>
This fellow fought against all 3 other heroes and their companions. <br/>
No matter who you are there should still be fatigue. <br/>
 <br/>
"I'll end it with this." <br/>
 <br/>
The enemy's whole body starts glowing. <br/>
That's bad! This is the same attack that took out the those 3" <br/>
 <br/>
"Raphtalia, Firo!" <br/>
 <br/>
The enemy starts to rotate at high speed like a dance. <br/>
Raphtalia and Firo hide behind me, although just barely they were able to make it. <br/>
 <br/>
"Shield Prison!" <br/>
 <br/>
A cage made out of shields and magic surrounds us. <br/>
 <br/>
"Rinbu Rei no Kata ・Gyaku Shiki Setsugekka!" <br/>
 <br/>
A great storm descends from the iron-fan and starts cutting down my shields. <br/>
 <br/>
"Dammit......" <br/>
 <br/>
what an incredible attack. No wonder the other heroes got swept up in it, even I am barely able to hold. <br/>
 <br/>
"You two, are you okay?" <br/>
"Barely" <br/>
"It hurts......" <br/>
 <br/>
When I look back both of them looked like they've taken considerable damage. <br/>
I applied heal ointment onto the wounds. <br/>
Because of the ranged cure skill, their wounds were gradually cured. <br/>
 <br/>
"Really?......To receive my trump and stand......Your defence is quite something." <br/>
 <br/>
The tornado stops, and the enemy appears again. <br/>
 <br/>
"I am honoured by your praise." <br/>
 <br/>
Though I am quite beat up, we haven't lost yet. <br/>
But we have nothing to get us out of this pinch. <br/>
 <br/>
"Ei~!" <br/>
 <br/>
Firo moves at high speeds and damages the enemy little by little. This will be a long battle. <br/>
Whether or not we can win this battle of attrition is doubtful. <br/>
What to do...... <br/>
There is only one move in this circumstance that can reverse the situation. <br/>
 <br/>
"Raphtalia" <br/>
 <br/>
I catch Raphtalia who falls down. <br/>
 <br/>
"What's wrong?" <br/>
"Lend me your power......" <br/>
 <br/>
It seems Raphtalia guessed what I was going to do. <br/>
 <br/>
"Okay. I am Naofumi-sama's sword. Even if you go through hell I will follow." <br/>
"......I know" <br/>
 <br/>
I believe it. <br/>
There is no fear at all that my trust will be betrayed. <br/>
But if I lose here, then Raphtalia and Firo will die...... <br/>
Though I dislike to, I wish with all my heart that I want to protect by all means. <br/>
I will absolutely not get consumed by anger. I swear so...... <br/>
I place my hand on my shield and think. <br/>
Shield of Anger! <br/>
 <br/>
Growth Up due to stone of the Zombie Dragon. <br/>
Ability improvement of the Curse Series, Shield of Anger! <br/>
Shield of Anger 2 <br/>
Ability Unsealed......Equipment Bonus: Skill "Change Shield (Attack)" "Iron Maiden" <br/>
Special Effect: Self-Burning Curse Physical Strength Up Rage of the Dragon  Roar  Frenzy of Companions <br/>
 <br/>
Then----- <br/>
Is this the last memory of the dragon that I absorbed into my shield? A scene is projected. <br/>
A part of the chest and the middle of the forehead is pierced by the Hero of the Sword.  <br/>
The anger felt is far beyond imagination. <br/>
I lost to that human. I was able to understand how much of a humiliation it was for the dragon <br/>
Grow Up......Like hell!? <br/>
The shape of the shield changed from one surrounded by flame to one that resembles a dragon. <br/>
Furthermore, in conjunction with the shield, Barbarian Armour +1 also changed. <br/>
Is the cause from......The decaying dragon core? <br/>
The Rider Suit changes to look like a Jet-Black Dragon. <br/>
 <br/>
And as compensation, a black shadow clouds my view......
