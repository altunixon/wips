Chapter 274: The Second Conference of Heroes [End]<br/>
Wait, the Dark Guild’s Membership card…?<br/>
My face cramps for a second.<br/>
"… And why do you have such a thing?" (Naofumi)<br/>
"It was a prize for one of the Coliseum events." (Itsuki)<br/>
"Ah, I see…" (Naofumi)<br/>
He brought out quite a dubious item…<br/>
Though, knowing Itsuki’s circle of friends, it’s not strange that he would have such a thing.<br/>
"As long as you can pay, there’s nothing you can’t get from them apparently." (Itsuki)<br/>
"I’ll use it if it becomes necessary." (Naofumi)<br/>
Honestly, I don’t really want to involve myself.<br/>
I mean, it’s probably full of people like the Slave Merchant.<br/>
Even the Pig King’s taken a liking to me. This may be a bit late, but I get the feeling that most of my acquaintances are villains.<br/>
It’s that: "Birds of a feather flock together," something like that.<br/>
… If I had to choose, I would say I’m a villain. I can’t find any evidence to deny that.<br/>
I mean, my enemy, Witch, was sent to a brutal execution. From the point of view of some protagonist out there, my actions are befitting of a criminal.<br/>
If this was a manga, perhaps some Hero of Light would be on his way to exterminate me.<br/>
But reality isn’t so sweet, so I don’t think that a messenger of justice will come for my head this late in the game.<br/>
Even so, why does Itsuki have this?<br/>
It’s something the previous Itsuki would have detested.<br/>
"I’m surprised a justice idiot like you kept such a thing. I thought you would try to crush them or something." (Naofumi)<br/>
"If used well, even evil can become justice." (Itsuki)<br/>
Is it like how assassination can be used to keep order?<br/>
That’s a statement befitting of Itsuki’s justice.<br/>
He may have even assassinated in the name of justice already.<br/>
"I want us to gather up the various gems, plants, and drops we’ve all collected. Naofumi, is that fine?" (Ren)<br/>
"Yeah, that might actually be the main point of this meeting." (Naofumi)<br/>
Based on all of our operations, we’re putting all of our knowledge down on paper.<br/>
Even I’m remembering things I was on the verge of forgetting.<br/>
I guess there are still things for me to learn.<br/>
And sacrificing my own knowledge isn’t a terrible price to pay for that.<br/>
"Ren, though you may already know, I’d like to talk about the Hengen Musou style of fighting." (Naofumi)<br/>
"The one that Eclaire and Rishia use?" (Ren)<br/>
"Right. That style focuses on the use of Chi." (Naofumi)<br/>
"Eclaire also explained it, but I can’t seem to understand it. Can you?" (Ren)<br/>
"A bit. Since Atlas, who can see things others cannot, has continuously been punching the weaknesses I’ve never noticed in my defenses, I think I’ve grasped something." (Naofumi)<br/>
I start explaining from the first time Female Knight showed me the style. Even if the heroes cannot use Mussou Kassei, the ability to recover Mana and SP will come in handy. It also has plenty of applications in skills.<br/>
As I was doing so, Ren, Motoyasu, and Itsuki begin reading screens invisible to my eyes.<br/>
"… It’s true. It wasn’t there before, but the item known as EP appeared in the help menu." (Ren)<br/>
"What?" (Naofumi)<br/>
"I think it’s an abbreviation of Energy Points… Using SP and Magic to power up skills, and raising abilities… How to use it is…" (Ren)<br/>
"W-wait…" (Naofumi)<br/>
It can’t be in the Help. It’s something I discovered.<br/>
It doesn’t even involve the legendary weapons.<br/>
"It also explains how to use it. There was an occupation that could do something like this in Brave Star Online. It was a bit simpler, but I think it’s something close." (Ren)<br/>
"Father-in-Law, there was also something like this in the games I played." (Motoyasu)<br/>
"Same…" (Itsuki)<br/>
Um, so it’s something like a job skill?<br/>
Something only a certain class can use?<br/>
Quit messing with me!<br/>
"Understanding the energy within the body… this is quite hard. But…" (Ren)<br/>
The Chi emitting from Ren starts changing.<br/>
It starts flowing around his sword. Eventually, it settles into a steady flow around his blade. I can tell all of this just by looking.<br/>
The same happens to Motoyasu and Itsuki.<br/>
Now if they were to use a skill, the potency would definitely increase.<br/>
"Fuee… Why can you use it after just getting that vague description?" (Rishia)<br/>
"Fuee…" (Naofumi)<br/>
"Fueeeeeee!" (Rishia)<br/>
"….fue…." (Editor)<br/>
"Fuee!" (Translator)<br/>
As I imitate Rishia, she cries out sorrowfully.<br/>
"Ku… My Mana, SP, and EP were instantly depleted. I’ll need to practice to master it. I feel really exhausted." (Ren)<br/>
"Right." (Itsuki)<br/>
"This is amazing! I, Motoyasu, will work hard for Father-in-Law’s sake!" (Motoyasu)<br/>
Belief can become power.<br/>
After listening to me, and believing in me wholeheartedly, it appeared in their help and they became able to use it?<br/>
Cut the crap.<br/>
Just how hard do you think I trained to learn that!?<br/>
At this rate, if I just show them the basics, they should be able to use it just fine.<br/>
I check the Help screen of my own Shield.<br/>
It’s not there.<br/>
… Am I a non-believer?<br/>
Perhaps the way I feel right now is the same as when the other three saw me getting strong all of a sudden.<br/>
"This power… if I mix it into skills and magic, will it amplify their power?" (Ren)<br/>
I’m at a loss for words as I watch Ren, Motoyasu, and Itsuki learning the basics of Chi control. The only thing I can do is watch.<br/>
I thought it was something I found on my own. They took it so easily.<br/>
How unfair this world is.<br/>
Even so, it seems that these three are finally starting to catch up to me…<br/>
Should I give up on telling them about Revelation?<br/>
I kinda want to be ahead, if even just a little.<br/>
However, as long as I’m in control, it would be best to teach them if we wish to overcome the wave.<br/>
If belief can become power, then if you don’t believe, then you won’t find power. I don’t think these people will betray me soon.<br/>
That being the case, since these people have the potential to become stronger than me, it’s best if I teach them.<br/>
No matter how far I strengthen the Shield, I can’t use it for offense.<br/>
And I’m curious as to what sort of large scale magic will come out of them using Revelation.<br/>
"Since you’re just learning the basics of Chi, I’ll have to explain SP later. Are you fine with postponing my explanation of magic as well?" (Naofumi)<br/>
"Yeah, I wanted to learn it, but if I have to figure it out one step at a time, I guess we’ll have to postpone it. If Naofumi teaches, then I think I can learn it quite fast." (Ren)<br/>
Ren’s lack of doubt in me is irritating for some reason.<br/>
Should I just make up some BS?<br/>
… But what if their belief in that BS makes it real!?<br/>
If it fails, they’ll begin to doubt me, so I should probably give up on that.<br/>
Though it wasn’t present at the time, when I checked later, it was clearly written in the Help.<br/>
And on my status, the stat of EP also appeared.<br/>
What I was able to confirm was that Heroes are unable to learn Mussou Kassei.<br/>
The Legendary Weapons make one different from the average person. Just by possessing one, the user is sent into a constant state of Mussou Kassei.<br/>
The Help called it Energy Boost.<br/>
Since it was perpetually active, it couldn’t be stacked on again.<br/>
It was quite a boring result.<br/>
"… Let’s see. I’ve also used Item Creation to try to raise the quality of items. I may be able to put it into practice… That’s about all I know for now." (Naofumi)<br/>
"Alright." (Itsuki)<br/>
"Father-in-Law, I still have more to say." (Motoyasu)<br/>
"Yeah, that was quite a productive meeting this time around." (Ren)<br/>
I get the feeling that these people were simply listening to me give a presentation though…<br/>
"Naofumi-sama…?" (Raphtalia)<br/>
The door to the meeting room opens, and Raphtalia sticks her head in.<br/>
"So this is where you were." (Raphtalia)<br/>
"Have you cooled down from the bath?" (Naofumi)<br/>
"Yes. I think it’s about time we returned to the village. I was looking for you." (Raphtalia)<br/>
"Ren wanted to restart the meeting that was put on hold earlier. We were just discussing a few things." (Naofumi)<br/>
"Is that so? So did you learn anything good?" (Raphtalia)<br/>
No, I feel like I’ve been the one teaching.<br/>
But since Ren, Motoyasu, and Itsuki are counted as part of my forces, I can’t call this result bad.<br/>
I guess these people were called to this world for a reason. They all have a screw loose in the right place.<br/>
"In order to respond to Naofumi’s trust in me, I will get stronger. Leave it to me." (Ren)<br/>
"Ah, yes, yes." (Naofumi)<br/>
Ren’s turning into an annoying person.<br/>
I didn’t like the old Ren, but the current one is simply oppresive.<br/>
"Yeah, Father-in-Law! I’ll also work hard!" (Motoyasu)<br/>
Motoyasu is annoying.<br/>
Mostly his way of addressing me.<br/>
"For some reason, I get the feeling that everyone here has gotten stronger." (Rishia)<br/>
Rishia holds Itsuki’s hand as she collects her thoughts.<br/>
But with this, Ren, Motoyasu, and Itsuki are on the road to becoming stronger. Is that alright?<br/>
