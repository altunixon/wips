Regis did not return to his room.<br/>
The brown door of ‘Atlas’ room was opened.<br/>
"Too slow!"<br/>
The one who had pointed at Regis was Altina, who had<br/>
changed.<br/>
She wore her usual clothes that emphasised ease of movement,<br/>
and brought along Grand Tonnerre Quatre.<br/>
Because of the way she acted and dressed, the people of the<br/>
Empire used to call her ‘the Arrow-sparrow princess’.<br/>
However, it seemed that no one ever called her that now.<br/>
Other than Altina, Eddie was the only one that used his<br/>
plain military uniform as ceremonial clothes.<br/>
The difference between Eddie and Altina was that he was<br/>
carrying Defendre Sept.<br/>
Standing beside Altina was Auguste who was still in his<br/>
ceremonial clothes-- Of course, it was actually Felicia.<br/>
Although Regis’<br/>
military uniform was in the room, but… … <br/>
Regis took a watch out and checked it.<br/>
"Looks like there’s no time to change."<br/>
"Still, you should at least wash your face."<br/>
Altina took her handkerchief out and wiped Regis’ face.<br/>
"Waah~"<br/>
 "Keep still!"<br/>
Although Altina sounded calm, she did not hold back.<br/>
Moreover, her eyes were terrifying.<br/>
This was how she wiped Regis’ cheek strongly.<br/>
"Ouch, o,ouch…"<br/>
"What? So you don’t want to clean this off?"<br/>
"No, it’s not painful at all, please continue."<br/>
"That’s right."<br/>
After all this, the mark left by Eleanor was finally wiped<br/>
off.<br/>
Altina who had an unhappy face all this time stared at<br/>
Regis.<br/>
"Regis, do you like girls that are older than you?"<br/>
"... … What are you saying? I never once considered such<br/>
things before."<br/>
"But, what about the girls in stories? Regis, you like the<br/>
older type, right?"<br/>
"Eh?! You can’t really say that; in Count Rudsel’s work<br/>
‘Messenger from the Stars’, it was a "ground-breaking and fantastic misty<br/>
heroine"<br/>
"Is Misty her name?"<br/>
"No, it’s a creature made of mist. Do not mind the small<br/>
details like the race difference, Groys, the protagonist, is a tortoise."<br/>
"At the least the characters should be human."<br/>
"Then, after renting a room in the capital, the protagonist<br/>
found that a female ghost decided to make the room her own. That ghost used<br/>
pankration to break the protagonist’s arm."<br/>
"In my opinion, ghosts aren’t human."<br/>
They chatted happily as they drew topics from books.<br/>
However, there was no more time for such leisure.<br/>
Regis and the rest moved deeper into of the room.<br/>
Eddie lowered his head and said.<br/>
"That, Regis, is it really fine even if we don’t escape?"<br/>
Not knowing when, Eddie began to speak to Regis like a<br/>
friend. Eddie was not only older than Regis, he was also a duke. By right, he<br/>
should be speaking to Regis in a loftier manner.<br/>
No matter what, it was normal for Regis to feel troubled<br/>
because of this.<br/>
The plan has been proceeding smoothly. Now, Auguste has been<br/>
liberated from the political struggle. On the other hand, Altina has gained<br/>
most of the nobles’ support.<br/>
"... Normally, it’s fine to exit from the front gate.<br/>
However, due to the incident earlier, it’s better to be cautious- let’s not<br/>
exit from the front."<br/>
Auguste— To be accurate, Felicia- cast her eyes downward.<br/>
"About that, seems like I overdid it."<br/>
"...... That’s also normal. No matter what, it’s impossible<br/>
to predict the development of an event that much, we can only come up with the<br/>
best answer. For things to go according to our prediction is something that can<br/>
only be achieved with magic… However, we also cannot just stand aside and let<br/>
things develop… Til the very end, what we can do is to adapt to the situation,<br/>
it’s the same right now…"<br/>
Noises could be heard from the corridor.<br/>
Those were the sounds of people running in their armour.<br/>
Hearing this familiar sound, both Altina and Eddie<br/>
stiffened.<br/>
"Wearing heavy armour in the palace?"<br/>
"Hey! Could it be that they are here to arrest us?!"<br/>
"...I’m not sure either… Do you want me to ask them?"<br/>
Eddie shook his head at Regis' question.<br/>
"Then let’s not do that, instead we should focus on escaping<br/>
first. We could make an excuse for Latreille like 'we went back because of a<br/>
stomach problem'."<br/>
Altina made a wry smile after hearing this.<br/>
"Eddie, you always use having a stomachache when you are<br/>
making excuses."<br/>
"It’s easier to be exposed if I said I had a cold."<br/>
"Ah, I see. Rather, I feel that getting deceived by such an<br/>
excuse will surprise me more."<br/>
"Eh, really?"<br/>
Aware of his past mistakes, Eddie began to reflect. At the<br/>
same time, Regis pushed the curtain aside and opened the windows.<br/>
The wind blew in.<br/>
The sun was slowly setting in the west.<br/>
Although it was still clear, black clouds quickly sweeping<br/>
over the sky.<br/>
It might rain tonight.<br/>
"...... It should be possible to go the courtyard directly<br/>
from here. I have already made arrangements to join our comrades."<br/>
Felicia slowly moved closer to Regis and brought her face<br/>
close.<br/>
Their shoulders touched.<br/>
As she was wearing a male uniform, the gold trinkets made a<br/>
sound.<br/>
Regis slowly moved away while Felicia slowly closed in.<br/>
It resulted in Felicia’s chest touching Regis’ body.<br/>
Although Felicia was in man's clothing, upon closer<br/>
inspection, she was actually a beauty.<br/>
They were obviously siblings, yet Altina was totally<br/>
different from her.<br/>
Altina was healthy and full of vitality. On the other hand,<br/>
Felicia was like a lake deep in the forest, like a flower blooming in the<br/>
plateau, or like piled up snow- something fleeting that would likely disappear.<br/>
Felicia looked out of the window and said hesitantly: <br/>
"J, jump down… f, from here?"<br/>
"Yes, but…"<br/>
Years ago, there was a popular book in the palace titled<br/>
"The Lost Pearl Necklace is in my Bag", the author was Florien Jean du<br/>
Weiyaller.<br/>
There was a scene in which the princess jumped down to the<br/>
courtyard from the ‘Atlas Room’.<br/>
Although the room was on the third floor, the height was the<br/>
same as a normal building, which was about 30 Co (13 m) high.<br/>
 \—\—Master Florien\~<br/>
That’s impossible?!?!<br/>
I suppose that in the novel, the princess had a foothold<br/>
like a footrest below the window. However, the situation right now is that<br/>
there is a narrow foothold that not even a mouse could step on. Rather than<br/>
saying it's a foothold, it’s better to describe it as art carved on the wall.<br/>
The slight protrusion from the wall seemed impossible to<br/>
climb.<br/>
There were no portrayals of the princess slowly climbing<br/>
down a pillar or digging through the wall with sheer force in the book.<br/>
"What’s going on… Was I not thorough enough in my<br/>
investigation?... Or is it that the popular book did not conduct any research<br/>
about this place…"<br/>
Altina who heard this also looked down.<br/>
"Eh? What, is everything that was written down fake?"<br/>
"N, no, there’s no lies. Accurate reporting isn’t<br/>
everything, rather, isn’t conjecture the first step to entertainment?"<br/>
"Why are you crying? Although I’m not very clear, but we<br/>
just need to jump down, right?"<br/>
"... … That was my plan."<br/>
"The faster we go down, the better?"<br/>
"Well, yes."<br/>
Regis nodded.<br/>
Eddie then opened all the windows.<br/>
The strong wind blew in.<br/>
"I’m going ahead."<br/>
Beside Regis, Eddie held the waist of Felicia who was<br/>
looking down.<br/>
"Hyaa!?"<br/>
"Felicia… Hold tight, don’t speak and close your eyes."<br/>
"O, okay, thanks."<br/>
"There’s no need to thank me."<br/>
Eddie used his hand to lightly support Felicia’s legs and<br/>
waist, carrying her in a princess-style.<br/>
Then he jumped down from the third floor with a girl as if<br/>
he was using the stairs to go down.<br/>
"Yot\~to"<br/>
——Almost effortlessly.<br/>
Regis stared at the pair who had landed safely after jumping<br/>
out of the window.<br/>
Even if Eddie was fine with it, this should be shocking to<br/>
Felicia.<br/>
However, Eddie kicked the wall about 15Co (7m) above the<br/>
ground.<br/>
What sorcery is this? They were falling at a very slow<br/>
speed.<br/>
Thus, they successfully landed.<br/>
Felicia who had just descended was full of spirit and waved<br/>
back at Regis. <br/>
Regis began doubting his own eyes.<br/>
"... What just happened?"<br/>
"He applied a little strength on the foothold slightly below<br/>
the window, did you not see it?"<br/>
"... By foothold, you mean that slightly protruding<br/>
carving??"<br/>
"Yes, if it has more than one finger's length of space, you<br/>
can use it to reduce the landing speed."<br/>
"To do that during the fast journey down? It’s impossible<br/>
for me… Seems like I won’t be descending from here. Altina, although it was<br/>
short, I won’t ever forget the time I spent with you… Ahh, if I‘m killed<br/>
instantly, then I can’t say that I won’t  forget, it’s just a few days after all… Eh,<br/>
that, wait, Altina\~? What are you doing?..."<br/>
Altina removed the Grand Tonnerre Quatre from her back, kept<br/>
it in the scabbard and tossed it out of the window.<br/>
A loud sound could be heard from the ground.<br/>
"Okay, now it’s your turn, Regis."<br/>
"W,what are you planning to do? I can’t, I'm absolutely<br/>
unable to go down, no\~"<br/>
Altina carried Regis from his waist, using both of her hands<br/>
to support his back and knees.<br/>
"Don’t speak and close your eyes… Ah, that… that, hugging me<br/>
tightly is fine."<br/>
"No!\~"<br/>
Altina also princess-carried Regis and jumped out of the<br/>
window.<br/>
Huu\~\~, The sound of the wind rushing by reached his ears.<br/>
It felt as if he was floating.<br/>
Soon, they reached the ground.<br/>
Regis experienced two impacts.<br/>
The last impact felt as if all the air in Regis’ lung was<br/>
forced out, causing him to roll around the ground.<br/>
"... … …"<br/>
"Regis, did something happen? Is it painful?"<br/>
"... I thought that I was going to die."<br/>
"You're alive, right?"<br/>
"...... To think that you guys dare to do such outrageous<br/>
things."<br/>
Altina, who had recovered from the fall, went and picked up<br/>
her sword.<br/>
"I’m different from Eddie, not using the foothold is fine<br/>
for me… Are we not discussing something urgent?"<br/>
"... Ahh, I knew this would happen."<br/>
This was all because I thought of Altina as a normal person.<br/>
Eddie stretched his hand out to help Regis up.<br/>
Regis’ knee was shaking, not due to the impact, but due to<br/>
the terror of his near-death experience.<br/>
"... Haah… …Let's hurry up to the courtyard."<br/>
"This way! Let me lead the way, I’m very familiar with the<br/>
area here."<br/>
The temporary fence that was used as a blockade was smashed<br/>
by Altina’s sword.<br/>
After reaching the courtyard, three horses were prepared<br/>
there. <br/>
Regis and the rest reunited with Eric there.<br/>
"It’s great that you are fine."<br/>
Regis nodded towards Eric who expressed his peace of mind.<br/>
"I bet that they did not think that we would jump down from<br/>
the third floor, which is why we are not discovered. We will be too<br/>
eye-catching if we walked through the streets."<br/>
"The journey begins here."<br/>
Altina smiled after seeing one of the horses in the line.<br/>
"Ara, isn’t this child the one that Latreille gave me? I<br/>
thought I wouldn’t see it again."<br/>
It was a maroon-coloured military horse, with a golden tail<br/>
and hind legs that were white at the front.<br/>
"I thought so too, but I managed to bring it along with the<br/>
help of the people working in the stables."<br/>
"Is that so, that’s great!"<br/>
When Altina’s subordinate requested three horses, someone<br/>
must have comprehended the dire situation they were in.<br/>
From another perspective, Regis worried that the enemy<br/>
deliberately did not control the movements of the horses.<br/>
Before leaving the capital, everything seemed smooth.<br/>
"... Let’s hurry and set off."<br/>
"That, Regis."<br/>
Eric spoke hesitantly.<br/>
"Yes?"<br/>
"Actually, I did not manage to loan a light carriage.<br/>
Instead, there’s only the slow luxurious carriage."<br/>
"... I see, that’s inevitable anyway. I’m not good at horse<br/>
riding either."<br/>
Seems like we are going to part here.<br/>
I hope I don’t need to escape on foot.<br/>
Perhaps I should hide at my friends’ house while Altina and<br/>
the rest escape.<br/>
At this point, Felicia also lowered her head and said.<br/>
"Actually… I do not know how to ride a horse."<br/>
"What, it’s just that? Ride with me then."<br/>
Eddie supported Felicia's waist and helped her onto the<br/>
horse.<br/>
"Hyaa!\~"<br/>
"The horse will kick randomly if you keep moving around."<br/>
"Eh\~\~\~\~\~"<br/>
Felicia swallowed her cries.<br/>
That was how Felicia got on top of the horse while Eddie sat<br/>
behind her.<br/>
Even though it was carrying two people, the horse did not<br/>
move about as it was trained.<br/>
"Th\~ere there, what a good child. Be it the horse or<br/>
Felicia, you need to behave."<br/>
Regis suddenly felt something bad was going to happen.<br/>
He felt someone grabbing his belt.<br/>
"W, wait, Altina… C, calm down. Even if both of us are<br/>
light, there’s still the sword."<br/>
"Don’t say such foolish words, Regis. If I have to leave one<br/>
behind, I will absolutely choose the sword.<br/>
"... … Anything but that."<br/>
"Then stop being so long-winded, learn from Felicia and just<br/>
sit still quietly."<br/>
"... … I,I understand."<br/>
Regis gradually gave in.<br/>
With the help of Altina, Regis climbed onto the maroon<br/>
horse.<br/>
He did not fall off and sat steadily.<br/>
If it was the past Regis, he would have shouted while<br/>
climbing onto the horse back. Any horse would hate that and attempt to shake<br/>
him off.<br/>
"... Eh, I did not fall off?"<br/>
"Could it be that you always ride a horse with a dreadful<br/>
mood?"<br/>
"Because falling down will be painful."<br/>
"It feels good while riding, hence it’s normal to be painful<br/>
after falling down."<br/>
"... Because I have never ridden one before, I’m wasn't<br/>
aware of that."<br/>
"In that case, you should try to enjoy it now."<br/>
The arrangement was Regis and Altina, Felicia and Eddie, and<br/>
Eric alone.<br/>
Altina pulled the reins to change the direction the horse<br/>
was going. Ah, no, it’s accurate to say that the horse changed to the correct<br/>
direction himself.<br/>
"What a smart horse."<br/>
"It seems that way."<br/>
"Have you not named him?"<br/>
"...... I will name him once we returned safely."<br/>
Regis and the rest walked along the palace’s wall.<br/>
Even if it was just the courtyard, it was still big. Altina<br/>
increased the speed of the horse, Eddie and Eric also did the same and<br/>
maintained the same speed as Altina.<br/>
Be it the palace’s wall, railings, lawns, flowerbeds or even<br/>
the patrolling soldiers, the surrounding scenery flew past them.<br/>
Felicia’s expression was as if she was about to cry.<br/>
Regis who had a similar expression looked at Felicia.<br/>
Although the situation now did not allow them to be slow,<br/>
the speed was simply terrifying.<br/>
At this moment, Eddie moved his horse closer to Altina's.<br/>
"Ahh, that reminds me, Regis\~"<br/>
"...W, wha, what!?"<br/>
Not only was it shaky on top of the horse, the clatter of<br/>
hoofs was loud, hence Eddie shouted.<br/>
"Clarisse and Lilim, they were escorted out by Abidal Evra."<br/>
"Ahh, okay."<br/>
As Regis was not used to horse riding, he could not speak<br/>
properly.<br/>
It’s great that the both of them escaped.<br/>
Regis told Abidal Evra and the rest to leave the capital<br/>
first, in his plan, 8 riders were not going to make a difference.<br/>
Avoiding any pointless sacrifice.<br/>
If Altina and Felicia escape now, it will be our victory.<br/>
There’s no need for us to exit via the front gate.<br/>
Regis was prepared to exit from the gate which was used by<br/>
the supply carriages.<br/>
"There are knights ahead!"<br/>
Eric shouted.<br/>
In the path towards the gate, there were about 10 knights<br/>
holding spears.<br/>
Green armour covered their body.<br/>
Regis did not have the time to think about other things.<br/>
Regis turned his head to Altina and said.<br/>
"...... They are imperial guards! I do not know how they got<br/>
the information about us, but it will be troublesome if we are stopped here."<br/>
"Are they strong?"<br/>
"Although they are soldiers, they did not participate in any<br/>
war, they are typical children sent out to train in the army and hail from good<br/>
families."<br/>
"I see."<br/>
"Try not to be too harsh on them… …"<br/>
"So we can easily charge them!"<br/>
"Wait, Altina!?"<br/>
"Keep your head down!"<br/>
When Altina shouted, Regis already stuck his body to the<br/>
horse as close as possible. Altina was leaning on Regis’ back.<br/>
"...... argh."<br/>
"Maintain it like this, charge\~\~\~\~\~\~!"<br/>
She commanded with the aura of commanding an army of<br/>
thousands.<br/>
But in reality, it were only Eddie and Eric.<br/>
The imperial guards raised their spears in a panic. In<br/>
addition, they were supposed to prevent people from entering, hence their<br/>
direction was facing the gate...<br/>
"S, stop right there!"<br/>
They seemed to receive a command to stop all personnel from<br/>
passing through.<br/>
Altina turned a deaf ear to it.<br/>
They did not slow down at all.<br/>
"I am the 4th princess of Belgaria, Marie Quatre Argentina<br/>
de Belgaria. Listen to my command, withdraw now and you will be pardoned!"<br/>
A group of the knights retreated.<br/>
However, there was still 5 knights pointing spears at their<br/>
direction.<br/>
Altina released the reins and used her legs to stabilise<br/>
herself while using Grand Tonnerre Quatre.<br/>
"Heyaaaa\—\—\—\—\—\—!"<br/>
The sword and spears clashed.<br/>
The line of spears was shattered just like that.<br/>
Altina’s idea of smashing their spears and breaking through<br/>
is reckless. This horse also has a problem for it to act in concert with her,<br/>
was what Regis thought<br/>
This horse was only ridden by Altina twice and was able to<br/>
understand its owner’s personality.<br/>
"How are you able to understand Altina’s thoughts?"<br/>
"Ara, I talked to him every morning."<br/>
"So that’s the reason!!!!"<br/>
Perhaps that was the reason why the people working in the<br/>
stable were so willing to help.<br/>
However, if it was me, forget three days, not even with  three years would I be able to make the horse<br/>
rush into the spears, was what Regis thought.<br/>
Eddie who followed them shouted.<br/>
"What a convenient sword!"<br/>
"Do you want to try switching it?"<br/>
"Haa\~! I feel that I won’t be able to lift it, so forget<br/>
it."<br/>
"Ahahaha."<br/>
This isn’t something worth laughing about, just carrying<br/>
this is already tough for normal people.<br/>
If not for the fact that it was a military horse, the horse<br/>
would not be able to move with the weight of two people and the sword combined.<br/>
Precisely because of that, the sword’s destructive power was<br/>
like a lightning strike.<br/>
Just waving the sword was enough to shatter the spears  was even strong enough to cause the heavy<br/>
cavalry to step back.<br/>
Although the imperial guards were often ridiculed as being weak<br/>
and for ceremonial uses, Altina’s aura and the sword’s strength were not normal<br/>
either.<br/>
After the gate was breached, Regis pointed in a direction.<br/>
"Just continue to head towards the north!"<br/>
"Okay!"<br/>
"... Most likely there will be pursuers, those real<br/>
knights."<br/>
If possible, please give me a pleasant surprise, was what<br/>
Regis prayed for. However, that would never come true as those thoughts were<br/>
not feasible.<br/>
Coming out of the capital, they reached outside——<br/>
They were close to the hills.<br/>
From the back came clattering sounds, and a dust cloud was<br/>
drawing near them.<br/>
Regis turned his head to confirm the pursuers.<br/>
When their white armours received the light of the setting<br/>
sun, they shone with a golden and deep red colour.<br/>
"... Although there are no banners, but, they… should be the<br/>
Knights of the White Wolves!"<br/>
They were the core of the first army.<br/>
"They were the ones that welcomed us, to think that they are<br/>
the ones sending us off."<br/>
"Do you want to greet them?"<br/>
"Yeah, they will catch up with us soon anyway."<br/>
Normally, the speed of the heavy cavalry was not fast enough<br/>
to chase after Regis and the rest. However, as 2 horses were carrying the<br/>
weight of two people on their side, the heavy cavalry gradually caught up.<br/>
Regis was looking at the map inside his brain.<br/>
He then pointed in a direction and told Altina to move<br/>
towards that way.<br/>
"Let’s go towards that small hill first."<br/>
"Is there anything there?"<br/>
"If we want to survive, that is the only way out."<br/>
"Regis, the horse is about to hit its limit.<br/>
"No matter what, we must reach the small hill."<br/>
"If we push too hard, we won’t be able to escape later on!"<br/>
Regis and the rest head towards the normal looking hill. In<br/>
the pursuers’ perspective, it seemed like they were running around randomly as<br/>
if they were avoiding rain.<br/>
There is a small hill near the capital, on top was a vast plain<br/>
with nothing that can be used to obstruct vision.<br/>
Because this area was a wetland, the horses' hooves were<br/>
covered in mud.<br/>
The speed of the horses would be reduced over here.<br/>
Their pursuers hadn't used bows or guns against them, so<br/>
they were likely ordered to bring them back unharmed.<br/>
Latreille’s aide wanted to make up for his losses, so he<br/>
planned to capture Auguste and reveal his real identity.<br/>
Following that, they would have the rights to nullify her<br/>
recommendation of Altina being a candidate, hence eliminating the obstacles for<br/>
Latreille to inherit the throne.<br/>
Clinging to the horse, a man muttered.<br/>
"... Prince Latreille, you are a military man. Until the<br/>
end, you can only rely on the soldiers. Because of your over-reliance, you<br/>
never would have guessed this would happen, hence you did not make any<br/>
preparations, is it not such? No, could it be that the one leading the soldiers<br/>
this time is Germain?"<br/>
The smell of oil gradually intensified.<br/>
Dragging through the mud, the horses finally went past the<br/>
wetlands and reached the summit.<br/>
The sky was gradually getting darker.<br/>
"... I would definitely book a carriage if there were still<br/>
time."<br/>
"Isn’t it your fault for not considering that in your<br/>
plans?"<br/>
"That is so, however the plan is about to succeed."<br/>
The horse which carried Felicia and Eddie, as well as Eric’s<br/>
horse also reached the summit. The horses' breathing was very erratic.<br/>
The Knights of the White Wolves also reached the wetland and<br/>
were heading towards the summit. If projectile weapons were allowed, the<br/>
distance now was close enough to shoot.<br/>
At the front was the captain of the knights.<br/>
The white armour shined under the radiance of the dusk.<br/>
"My name is Constant Felix de Bartoli!! Prince Auguste,<br/>
please return to the capital with me."<br/>
"Absolutely not!"<br/>
The one who rejected them was Eddie.<br/>
In fact, they did not even want to hear what the opposite<br/>
side had to say.<br/>
Constant, the captain of the Knights of the White Wolves<br/>
drew his sword, which looked yellowish under the light of the setting sun.<br/>
"In that case, I can only do the best of my capability to<br/>
bring you back."<br/>
The knights behind him did the same and drew their swords.<br/>
The enemies numbered about 1000.<br/>
They had crossed three hills ever since setting off from the<br/>
capital, yet not a single one dropped out. As expected of the strongest unit in<br/>
the Imperial Army.<br/>
Altina held up her sword.<br/>
"Despite knowing who I am, you still dare to say those kinds<br/>
of words? Do you still consider yourself a knight of Belgaria? Or are you just<br/>
Latreille’s private army?"<br/>
"For the Empire! We need to bring Prince Auguste back to the<br/>
capital! That, I firmly believe!"<br/>
"Then you should carry out your faith! I will not yield no<br/>
matter my opponent!"<br/>
"Yes\~!"<br/>
It had reached to the point where words were no longer<br/>
required, Constant ordered the attack.<br/>
The knights who were still in the muddy area charged.<br/>
It was close enough to see the pupils of the closest<br/>
knights; it was too late to turn back and escape now.<br/>
Altina brandished the large sword of hers.<br/>
That was the signal to attack.<br/>
Roaring sounds could be heard on the hill behind them.<br/>
Knights wearing black armour appeared.<br/>
This ambush reduced the aggression of the enemy.<br/>
Constant could not<br/>
believe it and moaned.<br/>
"...... Those're Jerome’s Black Knights!? Could they be<br/>
decoys?... Still, with just a mere 500 knights from the countryside? These<br/>
elite troops of mine will not lose!! Attack\~\~! Do not let Prince Auguste escape!!"<br/>
The enemy once again went on the offensive.<br/>
At this point, the Black Knights launched fire arrows, their<br/>
target was the center of the Knights of the White Wolves.<br/>
Using fire arrows on cavalry was not effective at all.<br/>
However, the Knights of the White Wolves finally recognized<br/>
the stench around them.<br/>
"It’s oil!"<br/>
It was too late to shout that out now.<br/>
This vast wetland was filled with the cheap plants for oil<br/>
extraction in the empire.<br/>
The result would be the same no matter what action was to be<br/>
taken.<br/>
Oil is a combustible liquid and the area here was filled<br/>
with barrels of such oil.<br/>
A pillar of fire rose into the sky.<br/>
Screams and cries could be heard.<br/>
Under the setting sun, the wetland contained a flaming lotus<br/>
flower.<br/>
The figures of the cavalry were hard to see in the red<br/>
flames.<br/>
Some allowed their horses to run freely, others fell off<br/>
their mounts and escaped from the hellfire.<br/>
However, what awaited the knights who lost their momentum<br/>
was the spears of the Black Knights.<br/>
The White Wolves captain Constant couldn't breathe.<br/>
His own unit was falling in the flames.<br/>
These elites among elites, these warriors that were trained<br/>
for many years had become charcoal just like this.<br/>
"Ahhhhh————!!!!"<br/>
Constant let out an angry and desperate cry.<br/>
Before him was someone dressed in black.<br/>
"Hmph, how foolish… If you could issue orders other than<br/>
‘attack’, your units wouldn't be burning like fuel."<br/>
"How despicable, Black Knight Jerome! You have lost sight of<br/>
the chivalric path and turned into a demon!!"<br/>
"Huhu, this demon-like method is what our strategist excels<br/>
in. Moreover, had you notice the oil and halted your advances, you should<br/>
understand that you shouldn't be moving forward, useless captain."<br/>
Jerome who was on a horse raised his 'Le Cheveux D'une<br/>
Dame'.<br/>
Constant also drew his longsword.<br/>
"It must be an error that a youngster like you is flattered<br/>
as a hero! Your so-called achievements must be due to the soldiers of the<br/>
Germania Federation being too weak."<br/>
"Kukuku… … Although you guys were hailed as the strongest<br/>
unit in the empire… But what results have you gotten for the past three years?<br/>
In the end, you guys are just clowns who are waving that title around."<br/>
"How dare you ridicule the First Army!"<br/>
"Kuhahaha! That prideful army, because of your lack of<br/>
intelligence, has already burned to a crisp."<br/>
"You bastard!!!"<br/>
With bloodshot eyes, Constant charged towards Jerome with<br/>
his sword.<br/>
This was a sharp thrust.<br/>
Jerome used his spear and blocked it, allowing the horse to<br/>
retreat to a distance suitable for a charge.<br/>
The spear was longer compared to a sword.<br/>
"Ha!"<br/>
In a moment, Jerome thrust out 3 to 4 times.<br/>
This was the technique he used to kill the enemy cavalry<br/>
during the Siege of Volk Fortress.<br/>
Constant let go of the reins, holding a sword in each hand,<br/>
and blocked the attacks.<br/>
"Ho\~ I thought that you would have lost your strength from<br/>
holding wineglasses in the palace all day."<br/>
"I don't drink!<br/>
"Pardon me for my mistake. Could it be that's the reason why<br/>
your brain is empty?"<br/>
"Die, you foolish person!"<br/>
Constant used his left hand to block the spear while the<br/>
right hand thrust at Jerome’s heart.<br/>
"You are looking down on me if you think that using a single<br/>
hand can ward off my attack."<br/>
"Ah!\~"<br/>
The spear that was deflected suddenly came in again at the<br/>
same speed as before.<br/>
However, the strength applied was different.<br/>
The first attack was to cause a crack on Constant’s sword,<br/>
the second was to break it.<br/>
By the third attack, there would no longer be a sword in his<br/>
left hand to block with.<br/>
The white steel armour was punctured.<br/>
"Gyaha\~"<br/>
"That reminds me, <br/>
among the 3 knight orders in the first army, what is your ranking? Don’t<br/>
tell me you are the strongest, if that is so, I’m too disappointed… Eh?"<br/>
The White Wolves captain died just like this and could not<br/>
answer his question.<br/>
Jerome removed the spear and Constant fell down from the<br/>
horse.<br/>
"Tch, what an ugly sight… If you tighten your grip with your<br/>
thighs at the last moment, you would not have fallen off the horse even when<br/>
you die. To believe that the enemy nation’s soldiers are weak, you are just<br/>
another fool that loves horses."<br/>
If Regis was not on the horse, Altina would have entered the<br/>
battle.<br/>
Altina had been watching the fight between Jerome and<br/>
Constant.<br/>
"That guy sure is strong."<br/>
"Sir Jerome is strong indeed… … Well, my eyes couldn’t keep<br/>
up with their movement."<br/>
"Did he hold back during our duel?"<br/>
"The choice of weapon is also a factor in a duel… Jerome<br/>
will be stronger than you if he is using a spear and is mounted."<br/>
"Compared to Latreille, which side do you think is<br/>
stronger?"<br/>
"... That is also something I want to know."<br/>
Eddie replied in her stead.<br/>
"Jerome should be stronger when using the spear? Latreille<br/>
will win if it is limited to sword. The spear is strong in the battlefield<br/>
after all. If it's in a confined space and close combat starts, under those<br/>
special circumstances the outcome would be different."<br/>
"I see."<br/>
"Argentina’s sword is special, hence it is not a good<br/>
reference."<br/>
Eddie shrugged his shoulders and changed the subject.<br/>
"——That reminds me, was using fire part of your strategy?"<br/>
"Yes, because I felt that the chances of the First Army<br/>
chasing us was quite high."<br/>
"You even knew about that?"<br/>
"Based on the situation at the banquet, Latreille would have<br/>
considered something like this. If we change the way we think, after the clash,<br/>
the chances of him losing credibility is high. Be it emotionally or logically,<br/>
considering the position of the commander-in-chief, Latreille will resort to<br/>
using the First Army… Isn’t that to be expected?"<br/>
"Ah, is that so?"<br/>
Eddie tilted his head and said.<br/>
Ever since the beginning, Felicia was unaware of how the<br/>
military works.<br/>
Altina shrugged her shoulder.<br/>
"Hearing it from you, it is easy to understand. However, if<br/>
I were to think alone, I won’t think that far ahead. After setting off, who<br/>
knows what will happen. The only thing I could possibly do would be to be more<br/>
careful."<br/>
  <br/>
"... Is that so?"<br/>
  <br/>
"Was it really necessary to attack with fire?"<br/>
  <br/>
"Regarding this, think about it, the knight orders are the core of the First Army, hence they are quite prideful. 
Therefore, the chances of them wanting a fair fight is high, hence using fire on them just come naturally to me."<br/>
  <br/>
"Looks like what Jerome said was true, how despicable."<br/>
  <br/>
"I believe that using 1000 knights to chase after 5 people on 3 horses isn’t noble either."<br/>
  <br/>
"That… indeed."<br/>
  <br/>
"... Now, Altina, please sit behind a little."<br/>
  <br/>
"I won’t be able to see the enemy that way."<br/>
  <br/>
"The situation has already concluded, we should be retreating too. There should be messenger soldiers behind them, so the army will also withdraw."<br/>
  <br/>
"Just withdraw like this?"<br/>
  <br/>
"Ahh, there is no longer a need to fight, we are just<br/>
pushing it if we continue to do so… They should be returning to the capital."<br/>
