Prologue<br/>
One night, I had a dream after a long time.<br/>
A dream when I slept really soundly, and dreamt about things I had long forgotten.<br/>
And when I woke up, I would have no memory about them.<br/>
When I occasionally remember the scenes in my dream, it would have already ended.<br/>
In my dream, I was still a child in elementary school.<br/>
Dad watched TV as he drank beer and cheered for his favourite baseball team.<br/>
Mother cut some sort of vegetable in the kitchen, probably onions.<br/>
Our family runs a restaurant, so this must be the off day that happens once a week. If not for this, it was impossible for our entire family to be around for dinner.<br/>
It was a family scene commonly seen in Showa period dramas.<br/>
I wasn’t interested in baseball, and asked Dad during the commercials:<br/>
「Dad, your culinary skill is better, but why is mother always the one cooking dinner when we are home?」<br/>
「Damn it, you—」<br/>
Dad leaned in close in a panic:<br/>
「Why are you saying this all of a sudden? What if your mother hears this?」<br/>
「That’s why I’m asking so softly… Why?」<br/>
「You… Asuta, do you dislike the meal cooked by your mother?」<br/>
「No, I like it.」<br/>
The six years old me shook my head firmly.<br/>
I was a likeable child back then, even I myself thought so.<br/>
「But I like the dishes prepared by Dad more, because your food is the most delicious.」<br/>
A line that I would never say now.<br/>
Also because I have lost the person who I could compliment.<br/>
「Well… Because I’m a professional chef… My job is to cook delicious meals…」<br/>
Dad had a troubled and complicated expression. He was just past 30 back then.<br/>
He was probably wondering if he should deal out judgement with his fists after hearing my answer. But after hearing a six years old give such an answer, he stayed his hand and admit his defeat.<br/>
「By the way, you have been eating the food I cooked everyday, right? Don’t you want to eat mother’s home cooked meal once a week?」<br/>
「I didn’t say I don’t want to, I’m just curious.」<br/>
The match had started on the television.<br/>
But Dad was still facing me, with his arms crossed and troubled.<br/>
「Your thinking is still wrong. When we’re home, mother should cook.」<br/>
「But why?」<br/>
「You ask me why… Because I’m a chef.」<br/>
Dad said with a stern face:<br/>
「The chef’s job is to cook for customers, and cooking for a family is a mother’s job.」<br/>
「Hmm…?」<br/>
I was just six and didn’t fully understand the significance behind his words.<br/>
Since his words appeared in my dream in this way, that means it left an impression on me.<br/>
One year later, my mother passed away. I said in tears:「I wish I can taste my mother’s cooking a little more.」<br/>
<br/>
