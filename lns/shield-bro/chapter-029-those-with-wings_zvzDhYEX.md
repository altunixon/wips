Tsubasa: Those with Wings <br/>
On the way back, we did not encounter Motoyasu. <br/>
Though, it's just a groundless fear of him angrily looking for me. <br/>
Raphtalia was energetic again after I returned from unloading the baggage in the village. <br/>
 <br/>
"Are you okay?"(Naofumi) <br/>
"Yup"(Raphtalia) <br/>
"Ha......that was fast"(Lumberjack) <br/>
 <br/>
The lumberjack was surprised that I returned so soon. <br/>
 <br/>
"This fellow here has great legs"(Naofumi) <br/>
 <br/>
Was the answer I gave to the lumberjack while I pet Firo. <br/>
 <br/>
"Gua!"(Firo) <br/>
 <br/>
Firo also energetically answered. That's right, you're very fast. <br/>
 <br/>
"Did you search the forest?" (Raphtalia?) <br/>
"Yeah"(Naofumi) <br/>
"We must go slowly when we return." (Raphtalia?) <br/>
"Gua!"(Firo) <br/>
 <br/>
Piki...... <br/>
What's that? This sound…… Growth should have ended. <br/>
I heard something from Firo. <br/>
I hope it's not some strange disease. <br/>
Today's harvest was quite good. <br/>
Raphtalia moves naturally while Firo's offensive power and speed is eye catching. <br/>
To be honest, the strength of her blows may already have surpassed Raphtalia. <br/>

My stats are improving wonderfully. <br/>
I should equip a shield that is efficient and has a high performance, but I still haven't found a place where farming gold and experience is efficient. <br/>
How many abilities have I already unsealed...... There are too many to keep track of. <br/>
In the first place, after unsealing lower class equipment such as the Orange Balloon Shield, I have never used the ability. <br/>
The most efficient shield I have is the Whetstone Shield and that is a necessity. <br/>
Though, I can use all my shields. <br/>
Today I unsealed 4 shields which probably won't be used. <br/>
 <br/>
 <br/>
We were walking slowly back to Forest Village, reaching only when evening arrived. <br/>
It seems cart training for Raphtalia is necessary. <br/>
We advanced leisurely a few times before she felt sick and had to stop. <br/>
As a result we arrived after the day was over. <br/>
 <br/>
"I am very sorry"(Raphtalia) <br/>
"It's fine, you'll gradually get used to it."(Naofumi) <br/>
 <br/>
I am pretty strange too, I can't get drunk. I'm not saying she doesn't have spirit, it's just in her nature. <br/>
Motion sickness is hard to get accustomed to. <br/>
Therefore, I want Raphtalia to quickly get used to the carts. <br/>
Well, I think Firo's explosive running speed is also part of the problem. <br/>
 <br/>
"Gua!"(Firo) <br/>
 <br/>
At this point, the change has already begun. <br/>
For a while, we didn't notice. No, I noticed but I chose to ignore it. <br/>
 <br/>
The next morning. <br/>
Raphtalia notices the changes and is lost in thought. <br/>
 <br/>
"Guaa!"(Firo) <br/>
 <br/>
When I arrived at the barn, the change was already over. <br/>
Firo..... In every aspect, has greatly deviated from the average Philorial and has become gigantic <br/>
The average height for a Philorial is 2m 30cm, about the size of an ostrich. <br/>
However, Philorials have bigger heads and necks. <br/>
Firo's current hight is 2m80cm...... <br/>
Her head reaches the ceiling when she stands up. <br/>
 <br/>
"Did we really get the egg of a Philorial? I'm beginning to think we bought something else entirely."(Naofumi) <br/>
"Yeah...... I think so too." (Raphtalia) <br/>
"Gua!"(Firo) <br/>
 <br/>
Firo swallows something with gusto. <br/>
There appears to be no more Chimera meat left in the stables. <br/>
2 cows worth of meat just disappeared. <br/>
Was that the last piece? <br/>
 <br/>
"I thought her appetite stabilized but......"(Naofumi?) <br/>
"She ate everything-!"(Raphtalia?) <br/>
"Gua-!"(Firo) <br/>
"Hahahahahahahahah"(Naofumi) <br/>
"This isn't a laughing matter!" (Raphtalia) <br/>
 <br/>
Well then, what should I do about her huge appearance...... <br/>
.....However <br/>
Piki...... <br/>
The sound of growth is heard again. <br/>
 <br/>
"Something is happening to cause that sound!"(Naofumi) <br/>
"Ummm Perhaps the cause of this growth is due to Naufumi-sama's shield?" (Raphtalia) <br/>
"That's possible. Maybe it's from Demon Trainer Shield 3's ability: Growth Correcting (Intermediate)"(Naofumi) <br/>
"Uh.....Naufumi-sama, what about the effects of Slave Trainer Shield?" (Raphtalia) <br/>
"Iyaaaaaaa"(Raphtalia) <br/>
 <br/>
Raphtalia cried and ran from the barn, so I had to chase. <br/>
 <br/>
"Ra-Raphtalia!?"(Naofumi) <br/>
"Recently, I thought my body was light. But that's because of Naofumi-sama!" (Raphtalia) <br/>
"Calm down!"(Naofumi) <br/>
"Wi-Will I become big like Firo!? I'm scared!" (Raphtalia) <br/>
"I don't hear any growth sounds from you"(Naofumi) <br/>
"Well... If you say so. Phew, that's good!" (Raphtalia) <br/>
 <br/>
That still doesn't change the fact that this is an unpredictable situation. <br/>
I glance at Firo and imagine Raphtalia growing to be like that. <br/>
 <br/>
"Are you thinking something rude?" (Raphtalia) <br/>
"......What are you talking about?"(Naofumi) <br/>
 <br/>
Raphtalia looks at me doubtfully. <br/>
 <br/>
"One moment, should we go back to the slave trader tent and confirm the situation?" (Raphtalia?) <br/>
"Yes, I think we should." (Naofumi) <br/>
 <br/>
It can't be helped. I don't want to return to the castle town because that place is unpleasant...... But we might have no choice. <br/>
 <br/>
"Gua!"(Firo) <br/>
 <br/>
We left Forest Village with Raphtalia fighting against motion sickness while Firo attracting attention. <br/>
On the way, Firo got hungry so we took a break and fought some demons to feed her. We arrived back in the castle town during the afternoon. <br/>
 <br/>
"Hey......"(Naofumi) <br/>
 <br/>
Firo's appearance changed again while I wasn't looking. <br/>
Her feet and neck shortened gradually, now she looks like she has the torso of an owl. <br/>
Though it changes the way the cart is being pulled. <br/>
The front of the cart that was pulled by rope around her body, similar to a leash. <br/>
Now, she uses her wings as hands and skilfully pulls the cart along. <br/>
 <br/>
"Kue!"(Firo) <br/>
 <br/>
Her chirp and colour have changed again, now she is pure white. <br/>
 <br/>
"Huh?"(Naofumi) <br/>
 <br/>
I got off the cart slowly and remeasure Firo's height. <br/>
She shrank? <br/>
Her height is back down to 2m30cm. But her width has increased and now it feels somewhat oppressive. <br/>
She resembles a certain mascot from an amusement park who gains weight unnaturally. <br/>
(Tl note: I don't get this reference.Can someone explain?) <br/>
 <br/>
"Kue?"(Firo) <br/>
"No, this is fine."(Naofumi) <br/>
 <br/>
Does Firo herself notice the change? <br/>
I don't understand this creature any more. <br/>
 <br/>
"Well......no matter how I think about it it's surprising. Yup."(Slave Trader?) <br/>
 <br/>
The slave trader continuously wipes cold sweat while observing Firo. <br/>
 <br/>
"Kue?"(Firo) <br/>
 <br/>
Firo became huge width-wise and now resembles an Owl-like demon. <br/>
Where did the figure of a friendly ostrich disappear to? <br/>
 <br/>
"Well, I want an honest answer. What was the demon that was inside of the egg you sold me?"(Naofumi) <br/>
 <br/>
In any case...... <br/>
When I point my finger threateningly, Firo prepares to attack. <br/>
 <br/>
"Kueeeeee!"(Firo) <br/>
 <br/>
The slave trader hastily checks a bunch of documents. <br/>
 <br/>
"This is strange. It says here that the egg Hero-sama purchased was a Phirorial egg."(Slave Trader) <br/>
"This?"(Naofumi) <br/>
"Kueee!"(Firo) <br/>
 <br/>
I throw some food at Firo, who skilfully swallows it all in one go. <br/>
 <br/>
"Well......"(Slave Trader) <br/>
 <br/>
That reminds me, I haven't heard that growth sound from Firo for a while now. <br/>
Is this her final adult form? <br/>
(tl note: Mega Evolution = Loli form) <br/>
 <br/>
"However, Hero-sama. It's only been a few days since you have purchased that egg, I take my hat off you."(Slave Trader) <br/>
"Don't deceive me with compliments. What kind of egg was that."(Naofumi) <br/>
"Umm... Is this the appearance the demon had in the beginning?"(Slave Trader) <br/>
"Nope"(Naofumi) <br/>
 <br/>
I explained about Firo's growth to the slave trader. <br/>
 <br/>
"It was a normal Philorial for half the time?"(Slave Trader) <br/>
"Ah, I stopped trying to understand this demon."(Naofumi) <br/>
"Kue?"(Firo) <br/>
 <br/>
I feel a little irritation at Firo who looks at me with a cute pose and tilted head. <br/>
Whose fault do you think it is that we're here. <br/>
 <br/>
"Kueee"(Firo) <br/>
 <br/>
*SuriSuri*She snuggles her entire body on me. Then I'm embraced by her huge wing, It's hot, Firo. <br/>
 <br/>
"Mu....." (Raphtalia) <br/>
 <br/>
Raphtalia raises her eyebrows and takes my hand. <br/>
 <br/>
"Kue?"(Firo) <br/>
 <br/>
Firo and Raphtalia stare at each other <br/>
 <br/>
"What's your problem?"(Naofumi) <br/>
"Uh, Nothing"(Raphtalia) <br/>
"KueKue"(Firo) <br/>
 <br/>
I say nothing. I wonder what's going on. <br/>
 <br/>
"So? How about it?"(Naofumi) <br/>
"Well, That is......"(Slave Trader) <br/>
 <br/>
It is pretty awkward in front of the slave trader. <br/>
Don't you know all kinds of demons? Aren't you supposed to breed and sell demons? <br/>
"Anyway, for the time being let me call an expert so she can be inspected, is that Ok? Yup"(Slave Trader) <br/>
"????"(Naofumi?) <br/>
"Kue!?"(Firo) <br/>
"I understand, it might take a while before the expert comes though. Yup"(Slave Trader) <br/>
"Well that's fine. If anything goes wrong, I demand consolation money."(Naofumi) <br/>
"Kueee!?"(Firo) <br/>
 <br/>
It seems Firo objects my answer by flapping. <br/>
However, a subordinate of the slave trader attached a collar to Firo and brought her into a cage. <br/>
Partially due to the fact that we are here, Firo enters obediently. <br/>
 <br/>
"Well then, I'll come pick her up tomorrow. Have an answer by then."(Naofumi) <br/>
 <br/>
Raphtalia and I then leave the tent. <br/>
 <br/>
"Kueeeeeeee!"(Firo) <br/>
 <br/>
I was surprised at the loud voice from the tent. <br/>
That evening, the storekeeper of the hotel suddenly calls for me. <br/>
 <br/>
"Umm Hero-sama"(Storekeeper of the hotel) <br/>
"hm? What do you need?"(Naofumi) <br/>
"A visitor has come to see you."(Storekeeper of the hotel) <br/>
 <br/>
Who is it? While I was thinking the storekeeper points to the counter. A man who I don't recognise is sitting there. <br/>
 <br/>
"Do you have some business with me?"(Naofumi) <br/>
"Um...... I am on an errand from the Demon dealer."(Errand guy) <br/>
 <br/>
Demon dealer......Ahh, that slave trader. Certainly you can't introduce yourself in public as such. <br/>
 <br/>
"So is there something wrong?"(Naofumi) <br/>
"Ummm, we want to return the demon that is being held there."(Errand guy) <br/>
"What!?"(Naofumi) <br/>
 <br/>
It's only been a few hours since then...... What could have happened? <br/>
When Raphtalia and I return to the tent, Firo's cry can still be heard. <br/>
 <br/>
"Iya, Iya, I apologize for the disturbance at this time of night."(Slave Trader) <br/>
 <br/>
The slave trader has a tired face while he greets us. <br/>
 <br/>
"So what went wrong? We had a promise to meet tomorrow."(Naofumi) <br/>
"Yes, that was my intention too, but Hero-sama's demon is slightly troublesome."(Slave Trader) <br/>
"Kueeeeeee!!"(Firo) <br/>
 <br/>
Firo behaves violently inside the cage until she spots us. <br/>
 <br/>
"She destroyed 3 iron cages, injured 5 of my subordinates, and 3 other demons have suffered serious wounds. Yup"(slave Trader) <br/>
"I'm not compensating you."(Naofumi) <br/>
"I take my hat off to the Hero-sama who thinks of money at such a time. Yup"(Slave trader) <br/>
 <br/>
Is this slave trader a masochist? <br/>
 <br/>
"So, what is it? did you find anything?"(Naofumi) <br/>
"Well...... It seems there's a witness report that says this one is similar to a King of Philorial."(Slave Trader) <br/>
"The king?"(Naofumi) <br/>
"Actually it's a lord of a group of Philorial, it's a story that is famous among adventurers."(Slave Trader) <br/>
 <br/>
This slave trader seems to have quite an extensive information network. <br/>
Well, there is a big group of wild Philorial and there are stories that they have a king who manages them. <br/>
The master of Philorial which rarely appear...... And it seems Firo is one of them. <br/>
 <br/>
"Hmm"(Naofumi) <br/>
 <br/>
Is this information reliable? <br/>
Maybe removing the slave crest, killing Firo, and letting the shield absorb her body. <br/>
Even though I can absorb blood and feathers, it is still my demon. Only the demon trainer shield will appear. <br/>
Or the level I have is insufficient. <br/>
I stare at Firo. <br/>
 <br/>
"......Kue?"(Firo) <br/>
 <br/>
Though the race does not appear on the shield, she is not hostile. <br/>
 <br/>
"So, what now?"(Naofumi) <br/>
"She is called the Philorial King, or Queen."(Slave Trader) <br/>
"Is it because Firo is female?"(Naofumi) <br/>
"Yup, it is awkward for me to do business with Hero-sama under these conditions......"(Slave Trader) <br/>
 <br/>
I observe the destruction caused by Firo around the tent. <br/>
Everything is broken! <br/>
I have no plans to sell her. <br/>
 <br/>
"......Sama"(Unknown Voice) <br/>
"N? What was that unfamiliar voice I just heard?"(Naofumi) <br/>
"uh,Ummm...." (Raphtalia) <br/>
 <br/>
Raphtilia holds her mouth and points to the cage where Firo was held. The slave trader is also speechless. <br/>
I look back at the slave trader and we trade puzzled looks. <br/>
 <br/>
"Masssterr~~~"(Yup, Firo) <br/>
 <br/>
A naked blonde girl with wings extends her hand towards me.
