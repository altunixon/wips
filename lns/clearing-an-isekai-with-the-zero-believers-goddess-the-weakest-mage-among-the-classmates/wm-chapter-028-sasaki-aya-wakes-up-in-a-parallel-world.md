<br/>
Cold.<br/>
The heating of the bus had stopped inside a blizzard, and cold wind was coming unceasingly from the broken windows. <br/>
There’s no way anyone can endure something like this.<br/>
(That’s how it is supposed to be. Then why is it that Takatsuki-kun can play games within all this?) <br/>
The eccentric guy that has been a classmate of mine since middle school was playing games as if it were a lunch break. <br/>
It seems he was having a silly conversation with his friend, Fujiwara-kun, that sits beside him, but right now they are silent.<br/>
Everyone probably doesn’t have the strength to talk anymore.<br/>
I can only hear the sound of the wind and the button smashing of Takatsuki-kun. <br/>
(Maybe I should say something to him for our last moments.) <br/>
Oi, you gaming idiot.<br/>
Look over here for a bit.<br/>
You are actually freezing, right? You are trembling a bit, you know?<br/>
(Why am I acting as if I am picking a fight? That won’t work.) <br/>
Is that game fun? <br/>
I am not good at RPGs.<br/>
I wanted to play games together again…<br/>
(Both parents of the Takatsuki-kun household work and come back late at night, so I was jealous of him because he could play as many games as he wanted.) <br/>
Takatsuki-kun.<br/>
Hey, look here.<br/>
Please let me hear your voice once more.<br/>
I couldn’t say any of the words I thought of…<br/>
(Ah, no good…) <br/>
And my consciousness sunk into the darkness.<br/>
◇◇<br/>
I woke up in complete darkness.<br/>
Pitch black.<br/>
I can’t see anything.<br/>
But I am conscious.<br/>
(Eh, what’s this? It is scary.) <br/>
My hands won’t move.<br/>
My legs won’t move.<br/>
(Am I alive? Or dead?) <br/>
Ah, my body moved.<br/>
(But it kind of feels weird.) <br/>
I was going for a flip of my body, but instead, it felt like the half part of my body twisted.<br/>
I felt like my body had become incredibly long.<br/>
(It is probably my imagination, but for now, I have to get out of here.) <br/>
Get out? Where?<br/>
I was stranded in the bus.<br/>
That’s why, this should be a hospital.<br/>
No, that’s not it.<br/>
This is no such place.<br/>
Anyways, I have to get out!<br/>
*Crack!*<br/>
An impulse I couldn’t really understand moved my body, and I broke through something and went out.<br/>
(It really is dark. I can’t see anything.) <br/>
It is not complete darkness like before, I could see a bit of light here and there, but I can’t tell where this is.<br/>
With a dizzy head, I slithered my way ahead.<br/>
"Oh, you are the fastest one from the sisters, my child." <br/>
I heard that voice from above.<br/>
I look up.<br/>
There was a beauty with blonde hair and blue eyes that was like a Hollywood actress.<br/>
She is beautiful, but has somewhat of a harsh attitude; that’s the kind of impression this woman gave.<br/>
And also, she is someone I don’t know.<br/>
"My cute child. Please let me see that face of yours." <br/>
No no no.<br/>
My mother is short and plain like me.<br/>
She is by no means a flashy beauty that would have 10 out of 10 people turn back after passing them by in the city. <br/>
Her body is also boing boing…wait, huh? <br/>
Isn’t her skin way too white?<br/>
She isn’t wearing clothes?<br/>
Isn’t her lower half weird?<br/>
There’s scales…or more like, there’s no legs…<br/>
"Oh my, looks like your siblings have woken up too." <br/>
Siblings…siblings…<br/>
I am the eldest daughter and I have 4 siblings.<br/>
They are all little brothers.<br/>
I played together with them a long time ago, but when you get older, you hang out more often between men.<br/>
Lately, big sis has been estranged and was a bit lonely.<br/>
(More so, my little brothers didn’t play games with me anymore.) <br/>
Even though in the past they would go ‘I will play together with Onee-chan!’.<br/>
Did I complain about this with Takatsuki-kun?<br/>
There’s no way my little brothers will be there if I turn around.<br/>
I turn around while thinking this.<br/>
…What was there…were a whole lot of siblings.<br/>
They had no limbs.<br/>
Crawling on the ground.<br/>
Slimy body, and thin slit eyes.<br/>
They were flickering their tongue in and out.<br/>
Snakes.<br/>
A whole area of them.<br/>
Snake Snake Snake Snake Snake Snake Snake Snake Snake Snake Snake Snake Snake Snake Snake Snake Snake Snake Snake Snake Snake Snake Snake Snake Snake Snake Snake Snake Snake Snake Snake Snake Snake Snake Snake Snake Snake Snake Snake Snake Snake Snake Snake Snake Snake Snake Snake Snake Snake Snake Snake Snake Snake Snake Snake Snake Snake Snake Snake Snake Snake Snake Snake Snake Snake Snake Snake Snake Snake Snake Snake Snake Snake Snake Snake Snake Snake Snake Snake Snake Snake Snake Snake Snake Snake Snake Snake Snake Snake Snake Snake Snake Snake Snake Snake Snake Snake Snake Snake Snake Snake Snake Snake Snake Snake Snake Snake Snake Snake Snake Snake Snake Snake Snake Snake Snake Snake Snake Snake Snake Snake Snake Snake Snake Snake Snake Snake Snake Snake Snake Snake Snake Snake Snake Snake Snake Snake Snake. <br/>
I was surrounded by snakes as far as my eye could see.<br/>
"Hiih!" <br/>
My brain couldn’t process this sight, and I felt my consciousness grow far.<br/>
But before losing consciousness, I faintly understood.<br/>
I have become a snake…<br/>
A snake monster.<br/>
Aah, God.<br/>
Isn’t this way too much?Previous Chapter l Next Chapter <br/> <br/>
