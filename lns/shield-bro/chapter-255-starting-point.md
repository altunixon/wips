<br/>
It’s a shorter chapter. That’s why it’s early. It’s not like I did it for you guys or anything, okay!? I-I’m not going to make too much a habit of 2 per day, baka!<br/>
<br/>
Chapter 255: Starting Point<br/>
"And like that, it doesn’t seem that Itsuki will pose a problem. We’ll need to monitor him, but as long as Rishia’s there, it’ll work out. He can’t really run, nor does he seem to have the intention of doing so." (Naofumi)<br/>
"I see, then I’ll leave him to you." (Queen)<br/>
"Well, if he does end up running away again, then I’m really going to dispose of him." (Naofumi)<br/>
"… That’s something I would like to avoid." (Queen)<br/>
"Alright. Next, we can use Motoyasu’s teleportation to make use of Cal Mira’s healing onsen." (Naofumi)<br/>
"The heroes all seem to have an overly convenient warping ability. Please make use of it to recuperate yourselves." (Queen)<br/>
Before Motoyasu left for Faubley, I ordered him to take Ren there once to make sure we could open a portal if necessary.<br/>
We negotiated with the Count there and got permission to use the onsen that cures curses every night.<br/>
With this, the curses should pass faster.<br/>
"… We suffered quite some heavy damage during this incident." (Queen)<br/>
"Yeah." (Naofumi)<br/>
It’s the same at my place.<br/>
Though, it’s still within levels that we can recover from, and my Filo Rials are helping in procuring materials. It seems recovery will be faster than expected.<br/>
I didn’t want to spread the Camping Plants too much, but I’ve had to distribute them to the village.<br/>
I also brought some here to use as temporary relief. We’ll all be able to manage somehow.<br/>
Though, I dread what’s become of this nation’s finances.<br/>
Ah, right. The base the Three Hero Church used had some treasure piled up in it. Apparently, it came from the nobles.<br/>
The Queen decided that all of it would go towards financing the recovery effort.<br/>
This country’s trash has finally been driven out.<br/>
"Again… and again, I kept telling her to correct her personality. Even from when she was little." (Queen)<br/>
"Like I care." (Naofumi)<br/>
"That’s right… this is all due to my negligence." (Queen)<br/>
"You’re also slacking on Trash duty." (Naofumi)<br/>
"… He was an extraordinary person at the start, but he’s changed. He was swallowed by the power and authority he obtained." (Queen)<br/>
I peer out the window again. Fohl and Atlas are questioning Trash.<br/>
Trash is absentmindedly staring in the direction Witch was taken while he talks.<br/>
Hmm?<br/>
Fohl seems speechless.<br/>
What could they be talking about?<br/>
"The executions will start up tomorrow, but what will you do, Iwatani-sama?" (Queen)<br/>
"I’ll stay for some closure. After the primary offenders are taken care of, I’ll take my leave. I have to deal with Itsuki and prepare for the next wave. I can’t really afford to waste my time here." (Naofumi)<br/>
"I see. Then we’ll get into contact with you later." (Queen)<br/>
I can finally give the Wave my undivided attention.<br/>
I get the feeling that I’ve finally gotten to the starting point.<br/>
"Then I guess we should be off." (Naofumi)<br/>
After I finish my talks with the Queen, I prepare to head back.<br/>
"Ah, we’ll be continuing our journey for a little longer." (Raphtalia)<br/>
"I see." (Naofumi)<br/>
So we’ll be separating from Raphtalia… I feel a bit of regret, but it seems that she will be done soon.<br/>
"Atlas! Atlaaaaas!" (Fohl)<br/>
"Onii-sama, just go on your trip already." (Atlas)<br/>
Ah, right. Fohl also completed his Class Up.<br/>
I sent Firo with him to the Dragon Hourglass, but it seemed he couldn’t perform a special Class Up.<br/>
There was no choice, so I sent Gaelion over.<br/>
Just what standards does that Ahoge operate on??<br/>
With this, Atlas has taken the Firo route, and Fohl, the Gaelion route.<br/>
Even now, I can’t tell just what makes them different.<br/>
Since their race is the same, perhaps I will be able to witness the difference between the two Class Ups.<br/>
"Because of Fohl-san, our journey is taking longer than it should. Please be obedient here." (Raphtalia)<br/>
With a fed up voice, Raphtalia reluctantly lifts up her hand and embeds it in Fohl’s solar plexus.<br/>
"Ugu… I can still go on!" (Fohl)<br/>
"Then, me too." (Atlas)<br/>
Atlas chops the back of Fohl’s head.<br/>
"Guha! A-Atlaa…" (Fohl)<br/>
Hey!<br/>
Why are you following up?<br/>
"Your training is running late?" (Naofumi)<br/>
"Yeah. If we give him the chance, he tries to run home. It’s quite troublesome." (Raphtalia)<br/>
"Right. The instructor always leaves Fohl-san under Raphtalia-san’s watch." (Rishia)<br/>
"Is that so?" (Naofumi)<br/>
Dammit, just how much of a Sis-con does he have to be?<br/>
He runs away from his own journey.<br/>
"I’m currently the strongest of master’s disciples, so it naturally turned out like that… I can understand that he treats Atlas-chan dearly, but I think he should put his effort towards getting stronger for her." (Raphtalia)<br/>
"But, it’s going to last for only a little longer, right?" (Naofumi)<br/>
"Yes. I look forward to coming home." (Raphtalia)<br/>
"Then, let me walk you to the outside of the Castle Town." (Naofumi)<br/>
"Thank you." (Raphtalia)<br/>
My group accompanies Raphtalia’s to the edge of town.<br/>
"Look forward to the souvenirs." (Raphtalia)<br/>
"You got some?" (Naofumi)<br/>
"Yes. We brought a large variety." (Raphtalia)<br/>
Are they materials she got while training? If so, I’d definitely want them.<br/>
Raphtalia has values similar to mine. She probably knows what would make me happy.<br/>
"Well then." (Raphtalia)<br/>
"’Cya soon." (Naofumi)<br/>
I wave my hand as I watch Raphtalia set out.<br/>
"Then, should we be off as well?" (Atlas)<br/>
"Yeah, we already sent Ren and Rishia home ahead of time. We should…" (Naofumi)<br/>
"Carriage…" (Firo)<br/>
Firo suddenly lets out a questioning voice.<br/>
For some reason she looks like she’s going to cry.<br/>
"Ah, yes, yes. I haven’t stopped by the Old Man’s place yet, so I better go ask him." (Naofumi)<br/>
Does not having a carriage bother her that much?<br/>
But, I am also worried about the Old man, so it’s not a bad idea to check.<br/>
Though, I did talk with him a bit after the incident.<br/>
Apparently, the Three Hero Church remnants raided his shop and tried to stab him with the Dagger of Mob Mentality.<br/>
He could tell it was a strange weapon at a glance, so he immediately knocked them senseless, closed shop, and locked them up in an acquaintance’s house.<br/>
I did warn him, so this was to be expected.<br/>
After the incident began escalating, he helped evacuate the populace.<br/>
He truly is a reliable person<br/>
More importantly, just what level is that Old Man?<br/>
Level isn’t related to combat experience and technique, so perhaps it’s a rude thing to ask.<br/>
But, he seems to have a lot of experience for some reason.<br/>
"Oh, if it isn’t the young lad." (Old Man)<br/>
"How’s your store been faring?" (Naofumi)<br/>
"Quite a bit’s been stolen, but it seems that my money is still safe." (Old Man)<br/>
"I see. So do you plan on reopening soon?" (Naofumi)<br/>
"I can open at any time. Though, my variety won’t be the best." (Old Man)<br/>
"Then won’t you come over to my village this time?" (Naofumi)<br/>
"Again, laddie? I have no intentions of answering you at this point in time." (Old Man)<br/>
Imya’s Uncle has just returned, so I shouldn’t be too insistent with my invitation.<br/>
"And, what are you here for today?" (Old Man)<br/>
"My bird is begging for her new carriage." (Naofumi)<br/>
"Ah, that matter. I’m sorry, young lady, it’s not done yet." (Old Man)<br/>
"I see… Firo is sad." (Firo)<br/>
"As compensation, I’ll use some techniques from Faubley to improve it. Don’t worry." (Old Man)<br/>
"What do you plan on doing?" (Naofumi)<br/>
"They have something that lifts the wheels and body to lessen impact apparently." (Old Man)<br/>
… Suspension?<br/>
I see. This world has such things as well.<br/>
The old man unrolls a blueprint and shows it to me.<br/>
It involves attaching simple springs to the Wheel’s couplings.<br/>
"Then…" (Naofumi)<br/>
I supplement the design by sketching a damper on it.<br/>
Even so, it only uses simple pipes, water and air pressure.<br/>
It’s not like I’m that knowledgeable on the matter.<br/>
I’m only reiterating information that one of my friends who liked cars lectured to me long ago.<br/>
However, even with that, the Old Man’s eyes shine with admiration. He nods a few times.<br/>
"Boy, you know some interesting things. I’ll test it out." (Old Man)<br/>
"My world was one without magic. If you try using magic with this design, I think you may get a good effect." (Naofumi)<br/>
"I understand, boy. You don’t need to sketch it all out. I have the inspiration." (Old Man)<br/>
"I see. I’ll look forward to it." (Naofumi)<br/>
"Yeah! Firo will look forward!" (Firo)<br/>
After looking over the blueprints with the old man, we warp back to the village.<br/>
