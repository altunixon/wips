Damn this one was long <br/>
 <br/>
Chapter 51 <br/>
 <br/>
The Third Disaster <br/>
 <br/>
Today is the day that the old man finishes creating the equipment I ordered. <br/>
We arrive when the shop opens. <br/>
 <br/>
"Oh, it's the lad. You sure are early" <br/>
"I guess. So how is it? were you able to finish it?" <br/>
"Of course. By the way, your pot of of food has become an enormous topic for some reason." <br/>
"How would I know. Ask the guy who is spreading the rumour." <br/>
"That's impossible......" <br/>
 <br/>
The old man brings out our armour from the back of the shop. <br/>
Rather than making a barbaric suit by sewing bones to it, the dragon and chimera bones were grounded to a powder to make bone mail. Probably. <br/>
It's like Hokuto no Ken clothing Mark 2. <br/>
(tl note: Fist of the north star reference) <br/>
By the way is this called a racing suit or a rider suit?   <br/>
 <br/>
"Old man, do you want to make me the king of thieves that badly?" <br/>
 <br/>
It may be because originally the materials were meant to be made in to savage tribal armour. <br/>
 <br/>
"Huh? What're you saying lad?" <br/>
 <br/>
As for wearing this...... Despite this being a fantasy world all I can think about is the Showa Era. <br/>
For now I might as well test its performance. <br/>
 <br/>
"By the way, how is this armour?" <br/>
"That was already quite difficult to custom-make, it's as good as Barbarian Armour +1" <br/>
"This +1 looks like it's not complete yet. Did you say whether or not there are clothes made from the Dragon skin to go with this?" <br/>
 <br/>
Even the design is different. <br/>
The front is from Hokuto no Ken, and the lustre from the zombie dragon skin reminds me of rubber. <br/>
Only the chest has a pitiful amount of metal to protecting it. <br/>
What can I say? It's perfect to ride on a motorcycle with. <br/>
Since there is no motorcycle in this would, will I be roaring across the lands on Firo? Stop thinking about! <br/>
 <br/>
Barbarian Armour +1? <br/>
Defence Up Shock Resistance (Intermediate) Flame Resistance (High) Darkness Resistance (High) Hp recovery (Weak) Magic Up (Intermediate) <br/>
Enchantment: Automatic Restoration <br/>
 <br/>
There are various resistances. <br/>
Automatic restoration...... I don't know the efficiency from this alone. I wonder if it will repair itself if It is ruptured...... <br/>
Based on these bonuses alone the performance should be great, I seem to have to wear these clothes that cannot be called armour. <br/>
 <br/>
"What's up lad? Have you seen this armour before?" <br/>
"You do know I'm not from this world right? In my world...... the comparison for this would would be clothes you wear while riding Philo Rial or horses." <br/>
"In that case, Master wear it and get on Firo!" <br/>
 <br/>
Firo stares at me with sparkling eyes. <br/>
 <br/>
"Lad. What this little bird Missy just said sounds incredibly obscene." <br/>
 <br/>
The old man mutters with a bit of a disgusted look in his eyes. <br/>
 <br/>
"Shut up!" <br/>
 <br/>
Old man, did you make this armour with thoughts of harassing me? <br/>
 <br/>
"What's wrong lad?" <br/>
 <br/>
......Should be different. There is no malice. <br/>
 <br/>
"W-well. I'll take it." <br/>
 <br/>
Raphtalia commented that I looked good dressed like that. <br/>
Wearing this outfit around town......I feel isolated. <br/>
......It's not even armour, it's more like clothes. Very sad. <br/>
 <br/>
Well, the preparations for the wave have finished without a problem. <br/>
Raphtalia's black bruises have recovered completely thanks to the strong holy water used every day. <br/>
I heaved a sigh of relief because it was able to be completely cured. <br/>
There might still be a scar left. But, I wanted to heal her as soon as possible. <br/>
Accessories for Raphtalia and Firo were also completed today. <br/>
 <br/>
"Here is the accessories you asked for" <br/>
"Yay~!" <br/>
"Okay" <br/>
"First off, Raphtalia" <br/>
 <br/>
I pass Raphtalia a bracelet made of jade. <br/>
 <br/>
"Thank you very much" <br/>
"The enchantment on that is Magic Up (Small). It will also act as a lightning rod for magic cast on you that lowers your Magic Defence." <br/>
"I'll treasure it." <br/>
"Is that really all you want? I can seriously make you some nice looking jewellery if you want." <br/>
"What are you saying.  We can't afford to waste time on looks." <br/>
 <br/>
That's right. <br/>
It can't be helped if the person herself doesn't want it. <br/>
 <br/>
"Next, Firo" <br/>
 <br/>
I pass Firo hairpin made of amber. <br/>
I put emphasis on the shape to make it look like a wing, to match Firo's demon form. <br/>
 <br/>
"It has an enchantment for Dexterity Up (small)" <br/>
"Thank you master~" <br/>
"I was a little limited by the materials on hand. If you want any changes then endure it for now." <br/>
"There are no problems with it. I will use this accessory to it's maximum potential." <br/>
"Yup! Firo will work hard!" <br/>
"I have high hopes" <br/>
 <br/>
We take the rest of the time to prepare. I made some arrangements with the kids who volunteered earlier. <br/>
Firo has already been briefed about fighting against the wave. At first Firo had a question mark above her head asking about what the wave was, but after a while she understood. <br/>
Medicine has been prepared. The carriage.....Is broken, and since the new one isn't completed yet, Firo pulled a cart instead. <br/>
Anyway, it seems to have become my duty to protect any villages in the vicinity since the other heroes just run off. <br/>
Though I am not actually needed to participate, it would be despicable to just abandon people. <br/>
 <br/>
 00:05 <br/>
 <br/>
5 Minutes left. <br/>
It seems i can sense where we will appear so I let the volunteer soldiers know beforehand. <br/>
Change shield to the Chimeric Viper Shield. <br/>
 <br/>
00:00 <br/>
 <br/>
It's time! <br/>
A loud sound similar to glass shattering echoes. <br/>
The scenery changes instantly. <br/>
We scan the neighbourhood calmly. <br/>
 <br/>
"This is......" <br/>
 <br/>
Yeah. Near the village with that man who was bringing medicine to his mother who was suffering from an illness. <br/>
No matter how much they rush the earliest anyone would make it here form the castle town would be a day and a half. <br/>
There are red cracks spreading through the sky. <br/>
 <br/>
"Hero of the Shield-sama!" <br/>
 <br/>
The volunteers who were also summoned run up to me. <br/>
As for the other three heroes----. <br/>
 <br/>
"Firo! If you're going to kick that spear bastard do it so that he flies towards the cracks. It'll help him get there faster." <br/>
"Okay~!" <br/>
 <br/>
Firo listens to my order and runs off. <br/>
Due to her speed she catches up to the correct party. <br/>
 <br/>
"Eh----?" <br/>
 <br/>
As soon as the spear bastard looks back he is kicked by Firo. <br/>
 <br/>
"""Waaaaaaaaaaaaaaa""" <br/>
 <br/>
His whole party was kicked away. It feels good to see that fucking woman also getting blown away. <br/>
Though there wasn't much damage since Firo held back. <br/>
 <br/>
"Wh-What did you do that for!" <br/>
 <br/>
It seems the spear is trying to say something to us. <br/>
I ignore the spear and glare at the bow and sword. <br/>
(Tl note: He's not saying any of the hero's names just calling them by their weapons) <br/>
 <br/>
"Stop being a fool and wasting time!" <br/>
"what is up with you right now!?" <br/>
"Yeah! We must defeat the enemies spawned from the wave!" <br/>
 <br/>
I am amazed at anger of the foolish heroes. <br/>
 <br/>
"Listen to me first, you can hunt the enemy afterwards." <br/>
 <br/>
I direct the volunteers towards the neighbouring village. <br/>
They nodded and ran off towards the village according to my orders. <br/>
 <br/>
"Now...... Stop interfering with our work!" <br/>
"It's different!" <br/>
 <br/>
Itsuki is surprised by my roar and looked at me with bulging eyes. <br/>
 <br/>
"Calm down and think about it. Because I cannot receive aid money, I will not fight against the main body of the wave. As far as I am concerned I will be trying to defend the towns and villages within the neighbourhood. Do you guys understand?" <br/>
"Yeah" <br/>
"You are disqualified as a hero" <br/>
"that's right!" <br/>
 <br/>
All their followers are taunting me. <br/>
 <br/>
"Now you guys.  Defeating the enemies who spawn from the waves is your job. I do not know whether or not the wave is stopped if you defeat the boss." <br/>
"It is connected to the boss!" <br/>
 <br/>
Itsuki seems to have gotten excited and answers. <br/>
Such a thing doesn't matter. <br/>
 <br/>
"However, besides that we have important work......do you guys understand?" <br/>
"What would that be?" <br/>
 <br/>
Ren even you don't understand? I mean you should know since this world resembles a game. <br/>
Why don't you understand? To ask that would sound very sarcastic so I'll hold back. <br/>
 <br/>
"Do you guys know about the Knights?" <br/>
 <br/>
The the heroes close their eyes at my voice. <br/>
 <br/>
"They will come later" <br/>
 <br/>
I bring out a magic flare and show them. <br/>
 <br/>
"The distance from here to the castle town is one and a half days on horse or philo rial. That's too far!. <br/>
"Then, what should we do!" <br/>
"How did you get this information!?" <br/>
 <br/>
I point at the volunteers running towards the village. <br/>
 <br/>
"Now that I think about it...... How did you transfer with those people?" <br/>
"Seriously? You guys don't even know the Party function......?" <br/>
"For companions?  I thought we couldn't have that many." <br/>
"This is different...... A party leader is nominated and everyone who is within the party is a subordinate, that also makes them all part of the transfer." <br/>
 <br/>
Perhaps......these guys. I have more knowledge about the wave compared to them? <br/>
 <br/>
"First of all that was confirmation. Now it is confirmed that we can bring help during the waves." <br/>
 <br/>
...... Nobody says anything. <br/>
 <br/>
"Do you guys know of the help and tutorial?" <br/>
"Yeah. We have mastered this world." <br/>
" Anyway, our top priority is to suppress the wave......so, see ya!" <br/>
"then fighting against the wave for you guys...... is a game? <br/>
"What?" <br/>
"What about it?" <br/>
"Let's hurry and go!" <br/>
 <br/>
My question was disregarded by Itsuki who ran off. <br/>
 <br/>
"Motoyasu, do you know the meaning of my question?" <br/>
"Well...... Instant dungeon?" <br/>
 <br/>
No...... <br/>
 <br/>
"This is different. Is it a time attack wave?" <br/>
 <br/>
Ren......that is also wrong. <br/>
 <br/>
"Is it like a guild war? or a game with large scale battles?" <br/>
 <br/>
there was a game in my original world where there was a big even in which the players had only a week to participate. <br/>
As expected, It seems that the only ones who can use the party system are the heroes. <br/>
In fact, if the knights were late last wave and if I retreated the damage would be tremendous. <br/>
 <br/>
"......Do you understand it completely because you used to run a big guild?" <br/>
 <br/>
Since their co-operation is top priority I'll just be subtle about it. <br/>
Of course the Heroes who are ace players have to lead the charge. <br/>
But, to minimize damage we must co-operate with the residents of this world. <br/>
The fact that they don't understand is amusing. <br/>
 <br/>
"I managed a team before." <br/>
 <br/>
Is Motoyasu's answer. <br/>
He glances at Firo's demon form. Well he probably doesn't want to be kicked. <br/>
 <br/>
"Then you cannot understand." <br/>
"I don't need to." <br/>
"Huh!?" <br/>
" It will all work out one way or another." <br/>
 <br/>
Sigh..... Am I a secretary making sure you do your work? <br/>
 <br/>
"I'm not interested in this." <br/>
 <br/>
Ren......I'm not good at talking to people about guild warfare since I didn't participate. <br/>
He is armour is quite cool. <br/>
I want to know if this guy is capable of managing a large-scale guild. <br/>
 <br/>
"Anyway, this time we need to do our best, and make sure to bring knights next time." <br/>
 <br/>
I need to lay a foundation to combat the waves. <br/>
Both Ren and Motoyasu run off without hiding their unpleasantness towards me. <br/>
Hey, Don't spit on the road! <br/>
 <br/>
"Anyway. Let's go the village in the neighbourhood too." <br/>
"Okay~!" <br/>
 <br/>
We got in the cart, and Raphtalia hurried to the village with me. <br/>
 <br/>
"Ouch-!" <br/>
 <br/>
We arrived at the village just as the wave got there. Everything is covered in shadows, wolves, lizardmen, condors, and some goblins. <br/>
These guys remind me of Demi-humans, but all dark and covered with shadows. <br/>
Respectively they are called, Dark Condor, Black Wolf, Assault Shadow Goblin, and Shadow Lizardmen. <br/>
(tlnote: ゴブリンアサルトシャドウ That is the best name for a goblin ever) <br/>
And there was "Dimensional" added before each of their names. <br/>
They are just like ghosts that disappear into shadows when defeated. <br/>
it's downright creepy. <br/>
These demons are totally different from the previous wave, is this going to be the case from now on? <br/>
At any rate, I'll leave all the troublesome things to those guys. <br/>
That is. <br/>
 <br/>
"Acha-!" <br/>
 <br/>
I hear a strange battle cry from the old woman whom I fed medicine to. She is faring well with a hoe in one hand. <br/>
The volunteers are perplexed by this old woman as well. <br/>
 <br/>
"Ah, the saint! Thanks for the medicine! Acha-!" <br/>
 <br/>
The old woman bows to me after delivering blow after blow with the hoe to the demons that are rushing forwards  <br/>
This old woman is quite strong, there are demon corpses left and right. <br/>
 <br/>
"Hey, you come over here and say thanks." <br/>
"Uhm right, Thank you very much." <br/>
 <br/>
The son of the old woman bows to me too. <br/>
 <br/>
"Anyway, for the time being please evacuate and take shelter, these enemies are spawning from the wave." <br/>
 <br/>
The volunteers are instructing the villagers to take refuge. <br/>
The intervals between more enemies arriving and eliminate the current demons is quite small. <br/>
We also join the suppression of the enemy. <br/>
 <br/>
"Acha-!" <br/>
 <br/>
The old woman casually slaughters the enemies. <br/>
Are these really the movements of a person who was about to die a month ago? <br/>
 <br/>
"My old strength was returned thanks to the divine blessings of the saint. Hahaha!" <br/>
 <br/>
The old woman glares at her son and he also starts fighting to his fullest but he seems quite shy. <br/>
However, he is not as good as his parent. The volunteers are barely able to put up a fight. <br/>
No one can compare to the old woman. <br/>
 <br/>
"Even though I look like this, back in my prime I was quite a famous adventurer. My level is the same as my age! Acha-!" <br/>
"What a reckless grandmother!" <br/>
 <br/>
I don't think even a thousand would be a match for her. <br/>
While I hold back the enemy, they are massacred by power that is comparable to Firo. <br/>
I'm scared that when the battle is over she will run out of battery and drop. <br/>
 <br/>
"What did I give that old woman to drink?" <br/>
"Who knows......" <br/>
 <br/>
Raphtalia watches the grandmother with utter amazement. <br/>
I will have to question her son closely later. <br/>
Anyway, now is time to treat any injured people. <br/>
 <br/>
"It is top priority for those who are injured fall back from the defence line towards the cart." <br/>
 <br/>
I perform treatment on injured people while giving instructions. <br/>
 <br/>
"Acha! Saint-sama, it seems there's a suspicious one among the invaders." <br/>
 <br/>
It seems there is a fairly big Dimensional Shadow Lizardman mixed in. He is about twice the size of the others. <br/>
 <br/>
"Raphtalia, Firo, we'll kill that fellow together." <br/>
 <br/>
The volunteers will be a burden. <br/>
 <br/>
"Okay!" <br/>
"Okay~!" <br/>
 <br/>
I run towards the big game. <br/>
The Dimensional Shadow Lizardman is brandishing a huge black sword. <br/>
I run in front of it and hold up my shield. <br/>
A loud screeching sound can be heard as sparks scatter. <br/>
Snake's Poison Fang (Intermediate) activates and poisons the enemy. <br/>
But there is barely any effect. This kind of enemy is a reptile after all. <br/>
However, poison is not what I was aiming for. <br/>
 <br/>
"Eryaaaaaaaaaaaaa!" <br/>
 <br/>
A fearless Raphtalia pierces her sword right in to the abdomen of the Dimensional Shadow Lizardman. <br/>
 <br/>
"Deryaaaaaaaaaaaaaa!" <br/>
 <br/>
The face of the Dimensional Shadow Lizardman is blown away by a single blow from Firo. <br/>
Dimensional Shadow Lizardman falls over and collapses on it's back. <br/>
 <br/>
"Amazing......" <br/>
 <br/>
One of the volunteers unconsciously lets his thoughts out. <br/>
 <br/>
 "Good! You guys go around the village and do damage control." <br/>
 <br/>
If the grandmother, six volunteers , and some adventurers who live here go protect the village a lot of the damage can be avoided. <br/>
There should still be other villages in this neighbourhood. It will be dangerous if we do not go help as soon as possible. <br/>
 <br/>
"Use what medicine you need, the ride won't be comfortable. Let's get going." <br/>
 <br/>
Some volunteers get into the cart per my instructions. <br/>
 <br/>
"Let's go!" <br/>
"Roger~!" <br/>
 <br/>
Firo pulls the cart that has become heavier, and starts running with her explosive power. <br/>
When we arrived at the next village, some volunteers looked to be in pain, but it wasn't particularly bad so I ignored it. <br/>
This village seems to have taken a lot more damage than the previous one. <br/>
Houses were burnt, and some villagers are injured. <br/>
 <br/>
"Hurry go rescue anyone you can!" <br/>
"O-Okay!" <br/>
 <br/>
While slaughtering demons we were waiting for the wave to end. <br/>
 <br/>
 <br/>
"......So slow!" <br/>
 <br/>
3 hours have passed since then. <br/>
We are barely able to defend the villages in the neighbourhood, but dealing with endless waves of demons is not very helpful. <br/>
The evacuation of villagers was done properly, and the casualties amongst villagers were minimal. <br/>
The refugees were not attacked when spotted because we were here. So our offences and defences continue as is. <br/>
It would be too late regardless. <br/>
How long are those heroes going to take? <br/>
 <br/>
"Hero-sama, leave this place to us. Shouldn't you go support the other Hero-samas?" <br/>
 <br/>
The child soldier who greeted me first gave the proposal. <br/>
 <br/>
"There is no meaning if I go......" <br/>
 <br/>
If I go to help them defeat the boss, they will just complain that I went to steal glory. <br/>
 <br/>
"But......" <br/>
 <br/>
The volunteers looks exhausted. Fighting for 3 hours against unending enemies will do that to your stamina. <br/>
Raphtalia, and Firo are also considerably tired. I am no different. <br/>
 <br/>
"Ahahahaha-!" <br/>
 <br/>
Firo kicks a Dimensional Assault Shadow Goblin while laughing. <br/>
Yup. Firo is still all right. That bird is a massive lump of stamina. <br/>
 <br/>
"Will you be fine?" <br/>
"Please leave it to me!" <br/>
 <br/>
There seems to be some stamina left over. <br/>
 <br/>
"Then I'll take you up on your offer. I'm counting on you." <br/>
"Okay!' <br/>
"Raphtalia, Firo, let's go!" <br/>
"Understood." <br/>
"Okay~!" <br/>
 <br/>
We left the village to the volunteers and adventurers, while we rode towards the boss of the wave on Firo.
