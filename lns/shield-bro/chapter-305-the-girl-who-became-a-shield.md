Chapter 305: The Girl Who Became a Shield<br/>
"Quit joking around!"<br/>
I understand what Atlas is trying to tell me.<br/>
And I shake my head at it.<br/>
"Do you understand the meaning behind your words!?" (Naofumi)<br/>
"Yes… I’m well aware. And still, I ask it of you." (Atlas)<br/>
Her face isn’t one of someone telling a joke.<br/>
I look towards Fohl.<br/>
He’s… standing still, and glaring at me.<br/>
Even when I want him to speak up here, he stays silent.<br/>
He’s gripping his fists so strongly that they’re starting to bleed, but why…<br/>
"And please allow me one more bout of selfishness." (Atlas)<br/>
"Wha-" (Naofumi)<br/>
I return my gaze to Atlas from Fohl, and see her mustering her power to get up. She gives me… A kiss on my lips.<br/>
The first kiss I ever got from a girl… tasted like blood.<br/>
As if her power supply had run out, Atlas falls to the floor.<br/>
"I always wanted this. My wish has finally been granted." (Atlas)<br/>
"Why are you acting love-struck in a time like this…" (Naofumi)<br/>
"Raphtalia-san." (Atlas)<br/>
"Y-yes?" (Raphtalia)<br/>
Atlas calls out to Raphtalia, who had been watching over the exchange silently the whole time.<br/>
"The battle that I promised would definitely continue forever… It seems that it’s finally over." (Atlas)<br/>
"No, it will still… continue forever!" (Raphtalia)<br/>
"Ufufu… for Raphtalia-san of all people to say something like that, I’m kind of happy. I think you understand, but I was always envious of you. No matter how hard I tried, I could never become Naofumi-sama’s number one. I knew." (Atlas)<br/>
"That isn’t certain yet! Your competition with me will still… go on… and on…" (Raphtalia)<br/>
Atlas smiles upon seeing Raphtalia shed large drops of tears.<br/>
And she made a speech as if she had forseen this outcome.<br/>
"You sure are kind, Raphtalia-san. I understand why he likes you, but please listen to these words." (Atlas)<br/>
"Not just these ones, I’ll listen to whatever words you have to offer. I’m fine with yielding Naofumi-sama once or twice, so please continue." (Raphtalia)<br/>
"Raphtalia-san, Naofumi-sama… likes girls more than you think. He’s a normal boy. That’s why it’s fine if you… watch over him a little more." (Atlas)<br/>
"… I know. But you’re the same, aren’t you? You can’t give up here!" (Raphtalia)<br/>
Raphtalia desperately pleads with her, but Atlas is already so weakened that she can’t even tell where she is anymore. She can no longer sense the chi in the air.<br/>
That’s just how little time she had left… the cold reality was approaching.<br/>
Eventually, as if she just noticed something, Atlas lets out words not directed at anyone in particular.<br/>
"Ah… that was right. Perhaps it would have been nice if I could spend my time with Raphtalia-san and Naofumi-sama together. Why didn’t I realize such a simple thing? … Thinking about it, I guess I’ve gotten another wish that will never be granted." (Atlas)<br/>
"You’ll live! If it’s Naofumi-sama, you can definitely be saved!" (Raphtalia)<br/>
"Thanks." (Atlas)<br/>
Atlas slowly shakes her head, more weakly than before.<br/>
"Naofumi-sama… please notice." (Atlas)<br/>
"What?" (Naofumi)<br/>
"I was always doing my best to become number one in your heart. But… that wish was never granted." (Atlas)<br/>
"What are you…" (Naofumi)<br/>
"Naofumi-sama, you yourself… probably didn’t think about it due to the wounds you bore on your heart. But become aware of it. Raphtalia-san… likes you as a member of the opposite sex. Just like me." (Atlas)<br/>
"What are you saying at a time like this!" (Raphtalia)<br/>
"If it… weren’t a time like this, I know that Naofumi-sama would never lend his ears. Please believe… geho." (Atlas)<br/>
I feel Atlas getting even weaker.<br/>
Ku… If I just use more Yggdrasil Medicine, and Revelation magic, then…<br/>
"Please… promise. I do nothing but ask things of you, so let this be my last request. Please… Naofumi-sama, please realize that there are people who like you. And please answer them. It’s a… promise." (Atlas)<br/>
"Yeah! I understand! I get it, so don’t push yourself any further!" (NAofumi)<br/>
God in heaven… please! Please save the people who believed in me.<br/>
Even from the moment I was born, I never wished for a miracle.<br/>
I never made a wish, even when Witch tricked me, and I wasn’t allowed a voice in this world.<br/>
"It’s a… promise. Though I already asked for quite a bit…" (Atlas)<br/>
"I get it… I’ll think about it, so…" (Naofumi)<br/>
"Ufufu… for me to be this precious to Naofumi-sama… I… was… hap…" (Atlas)<br/>
Atlas goes silent.<br/>
"At… las…?"<br/>
I frantically shake her, but she doesn’t move at all. Her expression is frozen in a kind smile.<br/>
"Atlas-san!" (Raphtalia)<br/>
"ATLAAAAAAAAAAASSSS!"<br/>
My scream… finds no answer…<br/>
I have no idea how peaceful her mind was in the end.<br/>
Raphtalia is shedding tear after tear. Fohl just continues staring at me silently.<br/>
"…"<br/>
Atlas’s life is no longer here.<br/>
What’s lying here is…<br/>
I mutter at Fohl.<br/>
"Hate… me." (Naofumi)<br/>
The sister he valued more than his own life died protecting me, and I couldn’t even save her… He has enough reason to hate me.<br/>
But the second the words exited my mouth, Fohl grabbed my collar, and stopped his clenched fist in front of my face.<br/>
"As if I could hate you! As if I could put your mind at ease by hating you!" (Fohl)<br/>
"Wha…" (Naofumi)<br/>
"Atlas, you see, until the end, she loved you! For your sake, she chose to sacrifice herself! Then I cannot… hate or resent you. I wasn’t able to save her either. If at the time, I had just stopped her, it would have never come to this!" (Fohl)<br/>
"But…"<br/>
Hypothetical possibilities floated in my mind.<br/>
At that time, if I stopped her, Atlas wouldn’t have died.<br/>
At that time, why couldn’t I answer to her feelings?<br/>
"At that time, if we had never met, Atlas… wouldn’t have died." (Naofumi)<br/>
My field of vision took a 90 degree turn, and I was sent flying.<br/>
It was only after I hit the ground that I realized Fohl had hit me.<br/>
"Don’t say such things, even by mistake!" (Fohl)<br/>
"But that’s the truth-" (Naofumi)<br/>
"If she didn’t meet you at that time, Atlas would be dead! I was never able to raise the money necessary for the medicine to prolong her life. The next time she had a spasm, she would have died! And still… the one who let us walk freely was you! I won’t permit you to say things like that." (Fohl)<br/>
"Even so… something like this…" (Naofumi)<br/>
"Don’t taint Atlas’s pride any further!" (Fohl)<br/>
Fohl turns his back to me.<br/>
Blood drips from his hanging hands.<br/>
He hit me, and I’m supposed to be harder than steel. He should be in pain.<br/>
The blood slowly drops on the ground.<br/>
"Atlas said it. She told me to think of the kids at the village like her, and to protect them. I have to honor her will! You are… the person I would have called my brother in law! I won’t let myself hate yooooooouuuuuuu!" (Fohl)<br/>
Fohl’s outburst echoes.<br/>
That voice… I’m not sure what power it held, but a bright light flew at him from the direction of the temple, and spun around him.<br/>
For a moment, a flash strong enough to make me close my eyes lighted the room, but it went out in an instant… On Fohl’s hands were a pair of Gauntlets.<br/>
"These are…"<br/>
They were familiar pieces of equipment…<br/>
What answered Fohl’s cry was the legendary weapon.<br/>
By scheme, or coincidence? The me of yesterday would have scoffed at this development.<br/>
But the current me doesn’t have the heart.<br/>
It’s already too late…<br/>
"I’ll definitely keep my promises to Atlas! I am… I am going to protect the villagers!" (Fohl)<br/>
Fohl ran off with tears flowing from his eyes.<br/>
To protect those on the battlefield.<br/>
I am… I am…<br/>
I sooth the sobbing Raphtalia, and… I think over the will left by the young girl that loved me.<br/>
"Please leave me alone for a moment." (Naofumi)<br/>
I hold up the empty shell that was Atlas, and I… plead to Raphtalia, Rat, and the healers.<br/>
"… Understood. But don’t forget that the battle rages on." (Rat)<br/>
"Yeah, I know."<br/>
Raphtalia and Rat nod, and depart.<br/>
With a dim mind, I think about my my memories with this girl.<br/>
That night when she first came to my room.<br/>
"Because I am the Hero of the Shield, The only thing this world lets me do is defend."<br/>
I scorned my own role as I spoke to her.<br/>
"… I know. When I look at this village, I see that everyone is being protected under Naofumi-sama’s wings."<br/>
"Wings…"<br/>
"If all you do is protect, everyone will someday leave your nest."<br/>
"Anyone that wants to leave can leave, and still I will protect this village."<br/>
"But then… Who will protect Naofumi-sama?"<br/>
"Wha?"<br/>
"This is what I think. If Rafatalia is Naofumi-sama’s sword, then perhaps I could become Naofumi-sama’s shield."<br/>
"Shield… That’s not as easy as it sounds, you know."<br/>
(TL: This is chapter 173)<br/>
That wish was granted at the cost of her life.<br/>
That means I have to honor her last will.<br/>
If I, who can do nothing but protect, can’t grant a wish as simple as this… I would never be able to forgive myself.<br/>
Right… No matter who scorns me, no matter who abuses me, I, who was unable to protect this girl will honor my promise with her…!<br/>
"…………!"<br/>
Now, I will commit a taboo.<br/>
I bought this girl’s life, exploited her, worked her to death, and now I was going to torment her even afterwards. Why must a criminal like me feel this guilt?<br/>
I gaze at Atlas’s body.<br/>
This is a girl who liked someone like me.<br/>
she unconditionally accepted everything in me.<br/>
I’m going to absorb that girl into my shield.<br/>
Panic. Fear. Despair. Lamentation.<br/>
Various emotions swirl around my head.<br/>
I can’t stop the shaking in my body.<br/>
Even so, it’s something I must do.<br/>
If praying that much won’t bring about a miracle, if he is going to see this irrationality, and turn a blind eye… then god must not exist.<br/>
No, he’s an existence that can’t exist.<br/>
Like I’d let him exist!<br/>
If a god that permits this exists, I’ll never forgive him.<br/>
No matter what happens, I’ll kill him.<br/>
I mean, isn’t it strange!?<br/>
Everything was working smoothly.<br/>
I gave ample warning.<br/>
We were going to return home without any casualties!<br/>
If that light didn’t exist, Atlas wouldn’t have died.<br/>
To hell with Heroes.<br/>
To hell with God.<br/>
To hell with the Wave.<br/>
To hell with…<br/>
Why the hell should I… for this unreasonable world…<br/>
"Atlas… I think I kinda understand the reason you don’t want to return to the earth of this world." (Naofumi)<br/>
The body of the girl who wouldn’t speak again was way too light.<br/>
But I will honor my promises.<br/>
I’ll never break them.<br/>
I won’t let her go to the heaven or hell of this shitty world.<br/>
"Ku…!"<br/>
The girl’s body disappears into my Shield.<br/>
It was the exact same light as when the Shield absorbed a monster or an object.<br/>
