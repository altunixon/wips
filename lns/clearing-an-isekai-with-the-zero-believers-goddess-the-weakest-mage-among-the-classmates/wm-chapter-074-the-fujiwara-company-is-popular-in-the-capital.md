<br/>
"Ooi, I’ve got the provisions provided by the Fujiwara Company." <br/>
"Not only that, we apparently can also get clothes." <br/>
"It really helps us with the children…seriously." <br/>
"The employees of the company are all cute beastkin, so it really heals me." <br/>
"Maybe I should apply for a job there…" <br/>
"The requirements for men are apparently strict."<br/>
The capital of Horun is currently in the middle of recovering from the damage of the monsters.<br/>
The area where the Giant rampaged had the most damage.<br/>
There’s also a lot of people who had their homes destroyed and now have nowhere to live in.<br/>
The country and church are providing temporary residences to the victims of this, but there weren’t enough goods.<br/>
Especially food and clothes.<br/>
The ones who read the situation the fastest and sent support were the Fujiwara Company. In other words, the company that Fuji-yan manages.<br/>
…Seriously, he is just way too amazing, isn’t he?<br/>
Is he really the same age as me?<br/>
On the day the monsters rampaged in the capital, he returned to Makkaren in his Flying Ship, gathered as many people and goods as possible, and came back.<br/>
By the time the other nobles and companies were finally able to give their personnel support and their goods, the goods of the Fujiwara Company had already reached all the affected people of the capital. <br/>
"Fujiyan-san is amazing, isn’t he?!" (Lucy)<br/>
Lucy says this while looking at the children in the shelter playing around.<br/>
"Alright. Follow the order, okay? Don’t go skipping the line~." (Aya)<br/>
Sa-san was passing around candies to the children.<br/>
Now that I think about it, Sa-san had 4 little brothers.<br/>
She was dealing with the kids as if used to it.<br/>
In these few days, Lucy and I have been helping out in cleaning out the rubble together with the adventurers, and restoring the houses.<br/>
A world with magic is nice.<br/>
Big pieces of rubble can be delivered easily by using something called Levitation Magic.<br/>
Lucy and I obviously can’t use that, so we were cleaning the old fashioned way.<br/>
We do get rewarded by the Adventurer Guild for this.<br/>
Sa-san is good at cooking, so she would work as a volunteer with Nina-san in cooking meals, and keeping company to the kids.<br/>
Lucy and I finished our work for today and had come to pick up Sa-san before dinner.<br/>
"Alright, this is the last one. Ah! Takatsuki-kun, Lucy-san." (Aya)<br/>
"Good work, Sa-san." (Makoto)<br/>
"Must be tough, Aya." (Lucy)<br/>
"Nah, it is fun to play with the kids." (Aya)<br/>
Even though it must be tough to do this continuously, Sa-san didn’t show any signs of being tired and had a smile on her face.<br/>
What a great girl.<br/>
"Let’s go back to the inn. I think Fuji-yan will be returning today." (Makoto)<br/>
"He has been moving around all the time as of late." (Lucy)<br/>
"Should we call Nina-san too?" (Makoto)<br/>
"No, it looks like Nina-san has to look after her store employees." (Aya)<br/>
"She has it hard… Even though she will be marrying soon." (Lucy)<br/>
"Yeah." (Aya)<br/>
The two girls had eyes of pity. <br/>
I see. It is true that Nina-san is engaged with Fuji-yan together with Chris-san. And yet, it is unfortunate they have been caught in this incident. <br/>
"Let’s return by ourselves then." (Makoto)<br/>
"Yeah." "Okay~." <br/>
Finishing our jobs for today, we return to the inn.<br/>
◇◇<br/>
At dinner.<br/>
"Maan, we finally have the chance to see each other." (Fujiwara)<br/>
Fuji-yan says with a loud laugh.<br/>
Chris-san at his side is completely exhausted.<br/>
"Are you okay, Chris?" (Nina)<br/>
"Aah…Nina, it has been a while." (Chris)<br/>
Nina-san seems to be taking care of Chris-san, so it will probably be okay.<br/>
"Thanks to Fujiwara-kun, the children seem to be energetic even without their houses." (Aya)<br/>
Sa-san had a smile on her face.<br/>
"It seems like you were helping out Nina-dono, Sasaki-dono." (Fujiwara)<br/>
"She was a great help! Sasaki-sama’s ability to deal with children is godlike." (Nina)<br/>
"I have been taking care of my little brothers a lot after all." (Aya)<br/>
She scratches her head embarrassed, but that’s just like her. Really, all the children of the capital seemed to really like Sa-san.<br/>
"By the way, Takki-dono, I heard about it! It seems you have defeated a Taboo Monster again!" (Fujiwara)<br/>
I don’t know where Fuji-yan heard that from, but he throws the topic about a few days ago at me.<br/>
"Oi oi, don’t thoughtlessly say that out, Fuji-yan. It was the combined power of the Glacial Hero, Prince Leonard, and the adventurers who were there." (Makoto)<br/>
I answered in a slightly jokey manner.<br/>
—The Taboo Monster was defeated by the Hero.<br/>
That talk is currently circulating in the people of the capital.<br/>
The day a rumour spreads that ‘the young hero was about to be defeated by a monster’ will be the day the people of the capital will fall in fear.<br/>
This was the move the royal family and the Adventurer Guild pulled.<br/>
The Capital’s Guild Master personally requested of the adventurers who were in the battle of the Giant to keep it low.<br/>
Of course, the shush money was from the royal family, so it was a large sum.<br/>
"Geez, Makoto, giving your achievement to someone else again." (Lucy)<br/>
Lucy said with a tone of amazement.<br/>
"But that kind of stuff is cool, isn’t it?! It is like a hero that protects everyone in the shadows." (Aya)<br/>
Nice way of putting it, Sa-san.<br/>
"In the first place, it was thanks to Princess Sofia that I was able to defeat the Giant. It is not like I gave my achievement away. It is technically as if the royal family was the one who defeated it." (Makoto)<br/>
"…You synchronized with Princess Sofia, right? What a fearless man you are, Takatsuki-sama." (Nina)<br/>
Nina-san had a flustered expression.<br/>
Well, it was an emergency, so it couldn’t be helped.<br/>
"Synchronization is that, isn’t it?" (Lucy)<br/>
Lucy seems to be remembering the experience of the past, she made a complicated expression.<br/>
"Did something happen?" (Chris)<br/>
"A long time ago, I synchronized with Lucy, and had my whole body burned." (Makoto)<br/>
"I see… That must have been rough." (Chris)<br/>
Chris-san had a surprised expression that seemed to not really get it.<br/>
"Hey, Lucy, give me your hand." (Makoto)<br/>
"Eh? What?", she says while extending her hand to me.<br/>
I grabbed her hand, and synchronized.<br/>
"Haau!", Lucy quivers.<br/>
"Hot!", and I was attacked by a heat as if I was doused by hot water.<br/>
"W-What are you doing?!" (Lucy)<br/>
"Ah, sorry, sorry. My proficiency increased, so I thought that maybe synchronizing with you would go well now, but…it didn’t work at all." (Makoto)<br/>
Isn’t your mana wilder than before, Lucy?<br/>
She has the Great Sage Skill that allows her to use Fire, Water, Wood, and Earth, so I should be able to synchronize with her. <br/>
Our body compatibility is bad.<br/>
When thinking in that way, the compatibility with Princess Sofia was good.<br/>
"Pervert." (Lucy)<br/>
Lucy mutters this with a red face and straight eyes.<br/>
"How rude." (Makoto)<br/>
No, suddenly synchronizing with her must have lacked tact. <br/>
"Hey hey, try it with me too." (Aya)<br/>
Sa-san grabs my hand.<br/>
"It is better not to, Aya. It feels tingly." (Lucy)<br/>
"Now now, it is okay, it is okay." (Aya)<br/>
She gives me an upward glance.<br/>
Sa-san isn’t a mage, so I wonder what would happen.<br/>
"Synchro." (Makoto)<br/>
But nothing happened.<br/>
"…I don’t feel anything." (Aya)<br/>
"Looks like it doesn’t work if you don’t have a magic skill." (Makoto)<br/>
"What, that’s boring." (Aya)<br/>
Sa-san is a close quarters power type after all.<br/>
She apparently has mana on the same level as regular people.<br/>
"Takatsuki-sama, Takatsuki-sama, I have Mid Earth Magic, and Elementary Water Magic." (Nina)<br/>
Even Nina-san took interest and extended her hand to me. <br/>
Or more like, you had water magic, huh.<br/>
I have never seen her use it.<br/>
Of course she wouldn’t, it is the weaker one after all.<br/>
I was about to grab the hand of Nina-san when…<br/>
[Will you synchronize with Nina-san?]<br/>
Yes<br/>
No ←<br/>
…What?<br/>
What’s with this option? <br/>
It didn’t appear when I did it with Lucy or Sa-san.<br/>
In front of me, there’s the face of Nina-san in excitement looking forward to it.<br/>
Her rabbit ears were going up and down.<br/>
This person is going to become the wife of Fuji-yan.<br/>
I don’t understand the reason, but I feel like I should not choose Yes.<br/>
I have a bad feeling about it.<br/>
"Lucy has the Great Sage Skill, but the synchronization failed just a while ago, so let’s not. Looks like I am not doing well right now." (Makoto)<br/>
"I see…" (Nina)<br/>
Nina-san looked disappointed.<br/>
(Even though that was your chance at NTR.) (Noah) <br/>
What are you saying, Goddess-sama? <Don’t ask Fuji-yan what that means, Makoto! For your sake, don’t look it up. Just think of it as ‘stealing her away’.><br/>
◇◇<br/>
"By the way, this time’s incident. It seems like the ones behind it were the devilkin-desu zo." (Fujiwara)<br/>
After a while, Fuji-yan said that.<br/>
"Devilkin?" (Makoto)<br/>
What was that?<br/>
"What is that?" (Aya)<br/>
It seems Sa-san doesn’t know either.<br/>
"Devilkin are apparently a race that have the mixed blood of demons and humans. In the dark times 1,000 years ago, at the era when the demons ruled and the humans were left alive as slaves, there were apparently many of them born. They are the survivors of this." (Chris)<br/>
Chris-san explains.<br/>
"The devilkin are a race that don’t have a country. Or more like, they are a vagrant race that have never had a country. They have been changing from the west and the north continent constantly. It is said that many are currently living in the ruins of the Moon Country…" (Lucy)<br/>
"The devilkin are a race hated by both the humans and demons." (Nina)<br/>
Lucy and Nina-san add.<br/>
"Haah…so there’s racial problems even in an isekai." (Makoto)<br/>
It doesn’t change no matter the world.<br/>
"Were they the ones who caused this incident?" (Aya)<br/>
"That’s right, Sasaki-dono. I was actually investigating the background of it, and it ended up taking several days-desu zo." (Fujiwara)<br/>
"""Eh?"""<br/>
He was even doing something like that while supporting the refugees of the capital?<br/>
What’s with this person? That’s scary.<br/>
"That’s right! Danna-sama suddenly found the culprit from within the refugees!" (Nina)<br/>
"I was scared. Just thinking about what would have happened if he had been stronger than Nina…" (Chris)<br/>
Nina-san was excited while Chris-san trembled.<br/>
"And so, and so?" (Aya)<br/>
Sa-san seems to want to hear the rest. I am also interested.<br/>
"We simply handed the devilkin that seemed to have been the culprit over to the knights-desu zo." (Fujiwara)<br/>
Fuji-yan answers while laughing.<br/>
"Lying is bad, Fujiwara-sama. When you handed over the culprit to the knights, you were even able to accurately tell the knights about their hideout. I clearly remember the strained expression of the devilkin at that time. Just when did you investigate that…?" (Chris)<br/>
Chris-san retorts in amazement.<br/>
Isn’t it that?<br/>
The cheat skill of Fuji-yan doing its work too well.<br/>
"No no, it wasn’t that big of a deal. Compared to Takki-dono, the danger was low." (Fujiwara)<br/>
Fuji-yan is being humble here, but this is seriously impressive.<br/>
We all celebrated each other’s safe return, and enjoyed a long awaited meal with everyone reunited.<br/>
◇◇<br/>
 The next day, we were called to the Rozes Castle.<br/>
The one controlling the place was the cool beauty, Princess Sofia.<br/>
This person has been working around the clock as well. It must be hard.<br/>
"Merchant Fujiwara, you have my heartfelt thanks for your contribution to the capital. The generous amount of goods and donations to the people. And even helping out in the capture of the devilkin that were moving in the shadows. Thanks to you, the lives of many were saved." (Sofia)<br/>
"I only did the natural thing as a person living in the Water Country of Rozes-desu zo." (Fujiwara)<br/>
Fuji-yan lowers his head respectfully. <br/>
How impressive.<br/>
"Do you have any wish?" (Sofia)<br/>
"Actually, I am going to be marrying the daughter of Makkaren, Christiana-sama." (Fujiwara)<br/>
"I see." (Sofia)<br/>
Princess Sofia didn’t get surprised and just nodded.<br/>
Eh? Are you going to speak out such an important thing here?<br/>
Is what I thought, but this is something I heard of later. A few days ago when returning to Makkaren, Chris-san reported to her family that she would be marrying Fuji-yan.<br/>
They apparently questioned her a lot, but the capital was in a state of emergency, so she managed to hurriedly convince them.<br/>
Of course she would be exhausted after that.<br/>
"If I am to receive land and peerage, I would like it to be close to Makkaren." (Fujiwara)<br/>
"Understood. Then, I will arrange it as so. I will be communicating the details to you at a later time." (Sofia)<br/>
"Thank you very much." (Fujiwara)<br/>
Looks like their talk has been wrapped up.<br/>
With this, Fuji-yan will be joining the nobles, huh.<br/>
Moreover, with two wives.<br/>
…I feel like Fuji-yan has gone to an incredibly faraway place now.<br/>
What’s with this feeling?<br/>
It is like when meeting an old friend after a long time, and he has become a company president or something like that.<br/>
No, that’s not a good comparison, huh.<br/>
"Next, Takatsuki Makoto." (Sofia)<br/>
Being called by Princess Sofia, I walk forward.<br/>
"Your accomplishment in defeating the Taboo Monster is greatly appreciated." (Sofia)<br/>
Eh? It is spread around that it is supposed to be Prince Leonard though. Is it okay to say that here?<br/>
I looked around, and Prince Leonard was looking over here with sparkling eyes.<br/>
Well, it is all relatives here, so there’s probably a gag order.<br/>
—Here, Princess Sofia takes a deep breath.<br/>
What is it?<br/>
I don’t need a peerage, so I am fine with money. <br/>
Aah, but Fuji-yan is a noble, so…is what I spaced out thinking when…<br/>
"Takatsuki Makoto, I will grant you the title of Hero of the Water Country of Rozes." (Sofia)<br/>
Princess Sofia says straight.<br/>
…Huh?<br/>
