Prologue<br/>
<br/>
My name is Lyle Walt. Currently I’m walking through the city that was boisterous since early in the morning.<br/>
My destination after leaving the inn was a blacksmith that was famous even in Dalien.<br/>
I stifled my yawn and touched my front hair to confirm the persistent bed hair there. My blue hair, blue eyes──and then the blue Jewel embedded into a silver necklace hanging from my neck were shining too today from the sunlight.<br/>
Speaking about my outfit, my right hand was carrying a jacket with fur around its collar, and two belts on my waist. Originally weapons would be hanging from them but today I was unarmed.<br/>
It was an unreliable appearance for an adventurer, but I’m unarmed because my weapons were left at the blacksmith for repair.<br/>
The girl walking beside me, Novem Forxuz was looking at me worriedly with her purple eyes. Her brown hair that was tied into a side ponytail looked radiant today too.<br/>
She was a magician wearing a blue coat and carrying a silver staff. Furthermore she was an amazingly skilled magician, a second daughter of a Baron house, and my former fiancée.<br/>
Novem is a girl who followed me who became an adventurer after I was driven out from my house that was a Count house──the Walt House.<br/>
I, who lost against my little sister Celes in the succession struggle, was driven out from the house because I wasn’t worthy for the position as the next family head. I fought my little sister and she wiped the floor with me. I who was driven out from the house got helped by Zel-jiisan who worked as a gardener and he gave me the blue Jewel that was the Walt House’s family heirloom.<br/>
When I who lost everything left the house like that, Novem came along with me. She followed me persistently even when I tried to turn her away. Moreover, she even sold her dowry to raise money for my sake and hired an exclusive instructor that was necessary in order for me to become a first class adventurer.<br/>
Actually, I didn’t seriously plan to become an adventurer when leaving the house, but Novem had gone that far for me, so I’m thinking to aim at becoming a first class adventurer right now.<br/>
Novem was a woman who was too good for someone like me.<br/>
It’s just, she is a bit……no, she is excessively overprotective, but the reason for that was because of me being unreliable. I was driven out from a Count house and became an adventurer following the flow of events, but until then I had never left my house even once. I didn’t know about the world and because of that I became an adventurer with the naïve thinking that I would manage somehow.<br/>
However, the world wasn’t that kind.<br/>
I had failed many times since becoming an adventurer. There were also several times where I almost lost heart within a short period of time. Even now after a month had passed since I arrived in Dalien and becoming an adventurer, I was bad because I kept making Novem worry. ……It was like that.<br/>
「Novem, I’ll be fine so don’t worry. I’m only going to get my weapons.」<br/>
I told her to assure her, but Novem still looked uneasy. Am I really that unreliable?<br/>
「As I thought perhaps I should also come with Lyle-sama.」<br/>
「No, I’m really just going to get my weapons. I’ll immediately head to the guild right after getting them.」<br/>
We had repeated the same exchange several times since the morning. Novem finally followed my opinion reluctantly.<br/>
「I understand. Then, I will be waiting at the second floor of the guild.」<br/>
There were already shops that were starting to open in the surroundings, calling out energetically to the passersby. Construction of the rampart that could be seen from between the gaps of the buildings also already started early.<br/>
Dalien──this town that was near the capital of the Bahnseim Kingdom was a city that was governed by a baron named Ventra Rodornia. This was a city that novice adventurers were thankful for because it provided a lot of jobs for them.<br/>
The baron house’s knights and soldiers defeated the monsters around two and maintained the public order. The lively city wanted more manpower for expansion construction work.<br/>
Because of that, rookies who hadn’t become adventurers for long were able to work safely behind the walls and earn money. And then, even when they went outside they wouldn’t meet any troublesome monsters.<br/>
Dalien was a convenient city for rookie adventurers.<br/>
Novem was uneasy, but she headed to the guild when we reached an intersection. She looked back at me several times.<br/>
I smiled wryly while waving my hand, and then I headed towards the blacksmith. My forehead was sweaty because of the morning sunlight. The season was already changing from spring entering into summer.<br/>
When I walked alone, I sighed deeply and muttered.<br/>
「I think it’s alright even if she trusts me a bit more though. Even like this I’ve succeeded in subjugating a bandit group and finally earned money in a way that is fitting as an adventurer.」<br/>
Dalien’s mining site. In order to rescue an acquaintance that was kidnapped by a bandit group lurking in there, I subjugated a bandit group.<br/>
More accurately speaking I was only driving them out, but I involved the feudal lord Ventra-san and the feudal lords of the surrounding territories too and made them annihilate the bandit group.<br/>
At that time I was given advice by the ancestors of the Walt House who currently were recorded inside the Jewel──a round blue gem with a diameter of three centimeters embedded into a silver pendant──hanging on my neck.<br/>
A wild voice laughed loudly. I could hear that voice from the Jewel. Perhaps it was better to say that the voice resounded inside my head, the loud voice didn’t reach the people passing by me.<br/>
The owner of the wild voice was the first generation head of the Walt House, Basil Walt. He had fur wrapped around his neck, and unkempt brown hair. His appearance was like someone from a barbarian tribe, or rather he was exactly a barbarian, but he was the founder of the Walt House, a house of feudal lords that was said to be the strongest in Bahnseim.<br/>
『Gahahaha, stupid idiot. Someone like you still have some ways to go yet. You’ve got to become a slightly wilder man like me.』<br/>
The one who poured cold water on the First who was in a good mood was the second generation head who was dressed like a hunter, Crassel Walt. Naturally he and the First had the relationship of father and son. However, this parent and child……had an extremely bad relationship.<br/>
『I told you already, you aren’t wild but a barbarian. Lyle, you mustn’t become like this guy.』<br/>
The one who objected to the Second’s voice was his son, the third generation, Sleigh Walt. He was a man with blond hair reaching until above his shoulder. He looked like a man of delicate features and a carefree attitude. Despite his appearance, he was the most black-hearted person among the seven ancestors.<br/>
He carved his name in the history of Bahnseim and he was talked through generations as a righteous general, but like this there wasn’t the slightest impression like that from him.<br/>
『Their conversation is just like usual. It’s amazing how they haven’t gotten tired of it. But, I too also wish that Lyle will work a bit harder though.』<br/>
Surely he was shaking his head while going ‘good grief’ inside the Jewel. The son of such Third, the fourth generation──Max Walt, a man with blue hair that was parted to one side and wearing glasses. He was the head of the house at the time when the Walt House that was formerly a feudal lord house with the lowest status of knight peerage advanced in rank to become a Baron house.<br/>
『I certainly agree with that. I have the same opinion too. But, when it’s chichi-uefather who said that, it makes me want to tell you that you have no right saying that.』<br/>
The Third, Sleigh Walt was the first head of the Walt House who died in war. After that the young Fourth succeeded him and it seemed he went through many hardships because of that.<br/>
……The Fifth, Fredricks Walt had green hair that he tied up behind him. His eyes were half closed. Normally he didn’t talk much, but this morning he joined the talk.<br/>
『How about the Fourth look at a mirror too.』<br/>
His short words were filled with dissatisfaction towards the Fourth. It wasn’t conspicuous because of the extremely bad relationship between the First and the Second, but the other parent-son relationships of these people here also contained some kind of problem. That was how it was in the Walt House.<br/>
The Sixth, Fiennes Walt were astonished at such Fifth. The Sixth was the tallest person among the ancestors. Compared to the Fifth with his small build, it was hard to tell which one was the parent and which one was the son.<br/>
His red hair and beard grew connected, giving him the appearance like a lion. He completely didn’t look like the house head of the Walt House when it still had the rank of Viscount, but he had a good-humored personality and he was like an older brother for me. In spite of his appearance, he was the one who was the most considerate to me.<br/>
『I also understand what Lyle wants to say. But, from Novem’s viewpoint you are still worrying. You should make her feel relieved by showing it with your actions from here on.』<br/>
It was the most reliable opinion. But a doubting voice towards such constructive opinion of the Sixth came. The voice came from the Seventh who was my grandfather, Brod Walt. He had swept back gray hair and a sharp gaze. I heard that he was an extremely strict person, but for me he was a kind grandfather.<br/>
『Even if the Sixth said that, honestly it doesn’t resounded in my heart. But you know, Lyle. You are already shouldering the lives of two people. You have to become more reliable.』<br/>
Two lives──yes, I was already shouldering the burden of two lives.<br/>
My former fiancée Novem who headed towards the adventurer guild just now.<br/>
She was a woman who devoted herself to me even after I got driven out from my house. I wanted to make her happy no matter what, but at this point there was one more person…….<br/>
The girl I saved from the bandit group──Aria Lockwarde, I had to shoulder even her life.<br/>
……It was an unexpected happening for me. Certainly I wanted to save her. She called out to me when I was feeling down after coming to Dalien. Aria-san had red hair that slightly curled to the outside here and there which grew out until her back, purple colored eyes, and a bright smiling face.<br/>
Aria-san’s father cooperated with the bandit group and received judgment. His punishment would also befall his family. So in order to save Aria-san from that, I made a deal with Ventra-san and drove out the bandit group. I handed them over to the knights of the territories where the bandit group rampaged, and solved the complicated problem between territories. I accomplished my promise and Ventra-san also spared Aria-san just as promised.<br/>
But, he wanted to at least make it so Aria-san seemed to be punished towards the public by selling Aria-san to a brothel. Although the brothel was a nonexistent one, and I without delay bought Aria-san into my possession to free her from being a prostitute.<br/>
Ventra-san didn’t need to be responsible for Aria-san after she got sold and only the fact that he had punished her remained, which saved his face. He spared Aria-san just as he promised with me. So to speak, it was laundering using a fictive brothel.<br/>
The ancestors of the Walt House were really something, but Ventra-san was also a cunning one. However, the final result could be said to come out just as desired. Though it was unfortunate that Aria-san’s personal history got sullied through it.<br/>
But. But, however!<br/>
Me buying out Aria-san from the prostitution had the significance of me shouldering the life of Aria-san.<br/>
Of course, I intended to free her after buying her. I intended to but, Aria-san was already penniless, she also had no home to return to. Unable to throw her out to the street like that, I ended up looking after Aria-san.<br/>
I did but, here Novem became a problem.<br/>
「……Normally speaking, you know? Typically, that is. If a man you love bought out a prostitute, the woman will get angry won’t she?」<br/>
It was the First who answered my question. But, for this First──Aria-san looked completely the same as his first love, furthermore she was the descendant of that person, so the First was partial to Aria-san.<br/>
『Lyle! If you are a man then show that you can at least shoulder the life of two women! I believe in you that you are a capable man.』<br/>
Previously, the First kept nagging me to absolutely make Novem happy seeing that she was from the Forxuz House that could be said as the house all generations of the family heads were indebted to.<br/>
Now he was telling me to make Aria-san happy too.<br/>
The Second was exasperated. He advised me with a sigh mixed in his voice.<br/>
『I never thought that Novem-chan would accept it. That was a great miscalculation. But, Lyle……it already happened. Besides, if the person herself doesn’t really object to it, then just accept it. It’s really envious you know. Do you know how hard it was for me to get my wife……especially because of the fault of a certain someone’s “Family Precepts”!』<br/>
Family Precepts──in the Walt House there were family precepts for taking a wife. Like the woman must have an excellent face and figure, or her skin has to be beautiful, there were a total of six requirements.<br/>
But, these family precepts……it was a lie that the First spouted out when he was drunk because he didn’t want to get married after his unrequited love, and it remained until now as family precepts.<br/>
The family precepts that had been protected importantly through generations, was actually a lie that was spouted while drunk!<br/>
It was a truth that I didn’t want to know. Well, this might be an example that made you think that’s how the world is.<br/>
「It’s Novem. To think that Novem would accept a harem……I’m not that skillful, I don’t know how to deal with two women at the same time. ……I’m feeling uneasy.」<br/>
The Fourth muttered something incomprehensible like 『Not skillful, is it. Well, I guess that’s true for you in that area』.<br/>
Even though I couldn’t satisfactorily treat even just Novem alone, with the addition of Aria-san too I didn’t know what I should do. Even though I was thinking of how to make Novem happy, I never even imagined that the number of people would increase to two.<br/>
I was unable to mentally prepare myself. The Third tried to remove my anxiety.<br/>
『Well, if you thought about the reverse of this situation, it wouldn’t be something amusing at all. But, Novem-chan looks happy. It also doesn’t look like she will become disgusted and abandoned Lyle……well, she is a second daughter of a baron house, so perhaps she is thinking that having a mistress is normal or something?』<br/>
My expectations were greatly disordered due to Novem’s action. I sighed and arrived in front of the blacksmith that was my destination.<br/>
The signboard was drawn with armor and weapon. Perhaps it was for the sake of people who couldn’t read letters.<br/>
I stopped talking with the ancestors for the moment. Actually this noisy talk was consuming my mana. Because of that, my mana would be continuously consumed if the talk continued for long and I would collapse at the end due to insufficient mana. Jewel──it was a tool that could use a special power that was different from the convenient magic, called Art.<br/>
My mana was sucked by the Jewel, the conversation with the ancestors who were resurrected inside the Jewel for some reason was also sucking my mana……the mana that I could use for myself was little. My handling of magic that I was skilled in previously now became poor. I also couldn’t use the majority of Arts that were recorded inside the Jewel. The current me was in such a half-baked state.<br/>
I would believe it even if I was told that this Jewel was a cursed item. No, I couldn’t help but think so.<br/>
「Well, it’s better compared to at the beginning I guess? ……Let’s get inside.」<br/>
I opened the door and entered inside the shop that was filled with the smell of iron, leather, oil, and so on. There was a customer already inside since early in the morning. But, the situation was strange.<br/>
The dwarf female shopkeeper had a small stature compared to humans. She looked like a girl, but the long lived dwarf who could live twice the age of humans generally could be in the age of sixty or a hundred even with their youthful appearance.<br/>
The shopkeeper of this shop too looked like a little girl wearing a leather apron. That shopkeeper was holding her forehead with a troubled look at the counter.<br/>
The customer, a youth had a small build and a plump body. His clothes were dirtier than soil compared to the people I saw in the city, he looked like a traveler that came to Dalien from somewhere.<br/>
There was a metal armor placed on the counter. It was a full set of armor, but there was a lot of dented spots on it. Besides, there was a large gash at one spot. It looked fatal.<br/>
「Look here, lad. The name carved on this breastplate isn’t yours right? I’m troubled even if you told me to manage somehow for something like this. You also cannot tell me the circumstance of this armor, I cannot handle this item then.」<br/>
The plump youth was troubled. And then, he also looked vaguely impatient.<br/>
「I, I’m sorry. But, please somehow……」<br/>
The Third showed interest at the situation.<br/>
『Oh? Don’t tell me this boy is bringing a stolen item? From his appearance he is a peasant……while the armor he brought has quite good quality. Did he steal it from a servant somewhere? That was a bold thing he did.』<br/>
The Third laughed, but in reality this was an outrageous matter.<br/>
Then, the female shopkeeper noticed me and gestured at me with her hand. I felt awkward but I approached the counter, then the youth put back the armor into his bag in panic.<br/>
For an instant I saw a trace of blood on the armor.<br/>
「I, I’ll come again.」<br/>
After seeing off the back of the youth that left in a hurry, the shopkeeper shrugged. I asked what was on my mind.<br/>
「What was that?」<br/>
The shopkeeper scratched her hair with her left hand while shutting her eyes.<br/>
「No, no matter how I saw it that was a stolen item. It had been wiped but traces of blood remained on it……what’s more, he didn’t ask me to buy it, he asked me to repair it. In addition he ask to keep the size as it is, he didn’t ask to fit the armor to his size. At first I thought he was asked by someone to do that.」<br/>
But, after hearing the youth’s story there was many things that didn’t fit and the shopkeeper was hesitating whether to accept the repair request.<br/>
『What a strange boy.』<br/>
The First was suspicious of the youth’s actions, but he also wasn’t that interested and didn’t say anything more.<br/>
The shopkeeper opened her eyes and looked at me. She looked really concerned about the trace of destruction on the armor just now.<br/>
She surmised what made such gash using her experience until now.<br/>
「That gash, could it be an orc perhaps? ……Now then, I’ve got to take care of the order of you too, boy. About the saber and short sword you brought the other day, frankly speaking they are no good already. They haven’t snapped but, they aren’t something usable anymore.」<br/>
When I fought the boss of the bandit group, the opponent used multiple Arts. I used my weapon, the saber and a short sword, in order to endure his fierce attacks. It seemed they couldn’t be repaired.<br/>
But, this was also something I already realized.<br/>
「Is that so. Then, along for a reserve please give me two new sabers. Short sword too……ah, three of them.」<br/>
The shopkeeper faced the shelves behind her, and from there she took two sabers to bring to the counter. Her movement was jaunty. As I thought I could only see her as a child.<br/>
「Here, they are fine right?」<br/>
I looked at the sabers placed on the counter. After that, I looked across the shop’s interior. Most of the weapons that were placed here gave thick and heavy impression. There were spears, blunt weapons, and then axes and bows. For swords, there were double-edged ones placed on the wall. Everything was created by the owner of this shop who was the shopkeeper’s husband.<br/>
But, the sabers that I were going to buy were items that were ordered from the capital of this country, Centralle. It seemed they were merchandise that were only left here.<br/>
The shopkeeper chose three short swords while talking to me.<br/>
「Boy, how about you also switch to a firmer weapon? All the merchandise of my husband is solid and evaluated well.」<br/>
This shop was a shop with good evaluation from adventurers, soldiers, and even knights in Dalien. In fact, this kind of shop was popular in Dalien that sought practical arms.<br/>
When I stared at an armor with little decoration, I could hear the complaints of the ancestors.<br/>
『If you are a man than a large sword that is like a lump of iron is the best.』<br/>
『It’s a bow. Bow! Lyle, bows are great.』<br/>
『The weapon you are used to is the best but, a doubled edged solid sword might be good too.』<br/>
『Daggers are the best.』<br/>
『……Serpent sword.』<br/>
『No, as expected a spear is also good but a halberd is undoubtedly the strongest weapon……』<br/>
『Lyle, guns are great you know? It’s pricey but, it’s a weapon with good prospects.』<br/>
Each of them was recommending the weapon they specialized in. Coming this far I had understood it, the ancestors inside the Jewel would give their advice, but what they said couldn’t be guaranteed as correct. They spoke their answer based on their respective sense of values and experience, there were also many times they were mistaken.<br/>
Furthermore, with seven people there their opinions wouldn’t match. Everyone said different things.<br/>
『If you’re a man then it’s a great sword!』<br/>
『Don’t look down on bows! It’s mankind’s greatest weapon!』<br/>
The First and the Second started quarreling again. I felt uneasy at my mana that was going down rapidly since early in the morning.<br/>
「……Well, I’m used to using a saber.」<br/>
The shopkeeper didn’t insist more after that.<br/>
「I see. Well, it’s something that you entrust your life to. I can admire those who have an obsession to their weapon of choice. What’s unfortunate is my husband didn’t make this so I cannot sell them confidently. Now then, these are the short swords. Choose which you like.」<br/>
There were a total of six short swords placed on the counter, each with subtly different make. I chose three from them and paid for my purchase, then the shopkeeper asked me.<br/>
「By the way, that girl with side ponytail isn’t here?」<br/>
「Novem? Today she is going to the guild ahead of me.」<br/>
The shopkeeper looked a bit disappointed.<br/>
「What’s with that. It would be great if you bring her here. My husband also would be in a good mood when that girl came. He would even expressly get out from the workshop and show his face. It’s really rare for him to do that.」<br/>
I could understand that they were really pleased with Novem……even more than towards me.<br/>
The Third spoke happily.<br/>
『As expected from Novem-chan. She is a good girl who is liked by her surroundings.』<br/>
I waved my hand to the shopkeeper and said my thanks, then I left the shop.<br/>
.<br/>
──Dalien’s adventurer guild.<br/>
Its first floor was opened and merchants took station there right from early in the morning. It was bustling like a market.<br/>
There were a lot of wagons coming and going, the adventurers who returned from outside headed to the first floor bringing materials and magic stones stripped off from monsters──the parts of monsters that could be processed.<br/>
The merchants bought materials from the adventurers. The magic stones were brought and sold to the guild staff at the first floor.<br/>
The adventurer guild was an independent organization that existed in each city. But, they adopted common rule and had connections with each other in order to manage adventurers.<br/>
They would cooperate with each other, but each of them was an organization that was independent from each other. Because of that each guild would have a strong personal characteristic depending on the area.<br/>
Dalien was kind to beginner adventurers, but it was a city that was insufficient for adventurers with real skill. The guild of Dalien too would prefer to focus their efforts on raising beginner adventurers rather than bothering about the adventurers who left after growing strong.<br/>
Novem who was going up to the second floor of such adventurer guild passed the adventurers who visited the reception since the morning.<br/>
Novem had well ordered features and it wouldn’t be wrong to call her a beautiful girl. But, most of the men who passed by her didn’t even give her a glance.<br/>
It was hard for adventurers, especially male adventurers to harbor romantic emotions towards the opposite sex in the same trade. But, Novem understood it best that wasn’t the only reason why male adventurers wouldn’t even give a glance to female adventurers.<br/>
Novem looked towards the counter without even any interest towards such matter.<br/>
There were three receptionists. Adventurers were lining up in front of each one and did some kind of procedure. There were also adventurers who stared at the billboard on the wall, checking requests or the price of materials. There were also people in conversation with each other talking about their plans ahead.<br/>
Novem found the figure of two females standing silently waiting in the noisy floor. She put up a smile on her expressionless face and approached the two.<br/>
One of them was Aria who was holding a luggage, staring uneasily at the surroundings.<br/>
Besides her, there was the figure of a female adventurer with short purple hair and brown tanned skin, Zelphy glaring at the males trying to call out to Aria.<br/>
The surrounding males were showing interest to Aria who wasn’t dyed in the color of an adventurer. Their attitude was the opposite from with Novem, like it was only natural to call out to a pretty girl. Zelphy glared at them and chased them away.<br/>
Zelphy was a daughter from a house that once served the Lockwarde House. After the Lockwarde House was ruined, they drifted to Dalien and became adventurers.<br/>
Because of that, for Zelphy, Aria was like an important little sister.<br/>
Zelphy was also an instructor who was teaching Lyle and Novem the basic as adventurers. Novem hired her with a lot of money, at the amount of 20 gold coins. She was a veteran adventurer that the guild recommended to them.<br/>
The two of them weren’t dressed for working after this, they were dressed casually. In the first place they had no plan of working today, it was a day to formally enter Aria into their party.<br/>
Novem greeted the two.<br/>
「Good morning, Zelphy-san, Aria-san.」<br/>
Aria and Zelphy replied to Novem while looking around questioningly.<br/>
「Go, good morning. E, err……what about Lyle?」<br/>
「Morning. Is he late?」<br/>
Zelphy seemed to think that Lyle was late, but Novem shook her head slightly in negative.<br/>
「No. Today, Lyle-sama went to pickup his weapon. He should be coming in time.」<br/>
Zelphy placed her hands behind her head and leaned on the wall.<br/>
「Now that you mention it, his weapons were tattered huh. However, I still cannot believe that Lyle defeated the bandit group’s Art user chief.」<br/>
Lyle would almost collapse when she made him clean a ditch. He collapsed after using magic. He also collapsed in the middle of discussion. He would lose consciousness in everything. Zelphy only had the impression of him fainting and was unable to believe that Lyle would accomplish such achievement.<br/>
On the surface, Lyle was only driving away the bandit group. But, Zelphy was there at the bandit group subjugation. Furthermore she was an adventurer with connection to the feudal lord Ventra. In fact, she also knew how Lyle moved behind the scenes.<br/>
Aria seemed to recall the time when she was rescued and she looked down with blushing cheeks.<br/>
「I, is that so? I thought he was really cool……a, at that time he looked tired……」<br/>
Aria had a positive reaction to Lyle, perhaps because she was in love with him. Zelphy was watching her with a bored expression.<br/>
Novem chuckled, then she waited for Lyle with the two of them. They stood near the wall and looked across the guild. Then, three familiar faces approached them. No, four people. The three were leading someone.<br/>
One of the four, a swordsman that could be called an agreeable youth, Rondo found Novem and the other two. He walked while taking about Novem’s group to a robed girl he was leading.<br/>
「Ah, there they are. Looks like he isn’t here right now but, I think he will come after this.」<br/>
A tall youth holding a spear on his shoulder with a Mohawk that looked like a delinquent, Ralph. However, he talked with a kind tone that was in contrast with his appearance to the girl.<br/>
「How about talking to those three first?」<br/>
A petite girl standing between those two youths while carrying a staff, Rachel was,<br/>
「Hey, you two don’t flirt with her! She is Lyle’s guest.」<br/>
The three were adventurers who became close with Lyle after coming to Dalien. The three of them came from the same birthplace and formed a party. They also cooperated with the bandit group subjugation. They were an adventurer party with the most interaction with Lyle and the others.<br/>
The girl wearing a black robe took off her hood and long black hair fluttered to the side. Black eyes that looked strong willed. Her figure emphasized her femininity. But, the large axe──a battle axe──on her back made her strangeness conspicuous.<br/>
Novem waved her hand to the approaching four people.<br/>
「Rachel-san and everyone……and Sophia-san, was it?」<br/>
The girl’s name was Sophia Rowely. She was a girl whose battle axe, which was her family heirloom, was recovered by Lyle during the bandit group subjugation. Novem also saw her at that time.<br/>
Sophia bowed and greeted them.<br/>
「Yes. I am Sophia Rowely. Many thanks for the other day. I’m really grateful for everyone’s help in taking back the heirloom of the Rowely House.」<br/>
Rachel nudged Sophia with her elbow. She looked slightly happy.<br/>
「Sophia-chan, she came here to thank Lyle. She was lost so we guided her here. Somehow it reminded me of when we met Novem and Lyle.」<br/>
Rondo put his hand on his chin and looked up slightly.<br/>
「You’re right. Come to think of it, this is the second time we guided someone to the guild. However, I’m glad that Aria-san also looks well.」<br/>
Ralph also nodded smilingly.<br/>
「Ain’t that right. I never thought that you would be helped with that kind of method. That guy Lyle too, I wouldn’t misunderstand if only he mentioned it.」<br/>
Misunderstanding, it was about Lyle buying out Aria. Rondo and the others knew about Lyle and Novem’s relationship, they were seriously shirking back when hearing about Lyle buying out Aria.<br/>
Now they realized that it was a misunderstanding and they guided Sophia here like this with the intention of apologizing to Lyle too. Rondo looked around.<br/>
「We’ve got to apologize quickly. Even so, Sophia-san too, you must have it hard to expressly come here to say your thanks.」<br/>
Then, Sophia tilted her head.<br/>
「Hah? No, I come to repay him back.」<br/>
Rachel nodded several times. Aria didn’t look amused looking at Sophia.<br/>
「I get it, Sophia came this far bringing something as thanks aren’t you? How honorable~」<br/>
Sophia tilted her head again to the opposite direction.<br/>
Novem seemed to notice something from that gesture of Sophia and asked to confirm.<br/>
「Sophia-san, let me ask just in case. What is your business meeting with Lyle-sama today?」<br/>
Then Sophia straightened her back and threw out her large breasts with her right hand placed on her chest. She answered with a really clear voice.<br/>
「I’m someone who has lost my house. I came here to return my debt to Lyle-dono with this body.」<br/>
‘With this body’, when she said that the surrounding male adventurers immediately focused on Sophia. And then they looked at Sophia’s body figure that was obvious even from above the robe with licking gazes.<br/>
Rondo and the others stiffened, Zelphy and Aria were also dumbfounded. Aria dropped her luggage.<br/>
……A strange silence enveloped the guild.<br/>
There, Lyle carrying his luggage climbed up the stairs.<br/>
「Fuu, as I thought perhaps I should have left them in the inn first? But, I also want to test their use……ah, everyone here. Oo~I, wait……e, eh?」<br/>
Lyle formed a subjugation group when defeating the bandit group. At that time he acted like an idiot noble so, because of that he became famous in Dalien in a strange way.<br/>
“The idiot noble son Lyle”<br/>
A nickname that he wasn’t happy with at all spread. The gazes of the men inside the guild that had fallen silent stabbed at Lyle.<br/>
「E? Eh!?」<br/>
Novem looked at Sophia, then she asked one more time.<br/>
「Sophia-san, I’ll ask one more time. What do you want to do with Lyle-sama that you came here?」<br/>
Even while feeling puzzled, Sophia answered with an even louder voice.<br/>
「I told you, I want to pay back my debt with this body, and so I came here today! I will pay back the favor of taking back my family heirloom with this body!」<br/>

Inside her heart Novem didn’t believe that Sophia would present her body to Lyle or anything. She understood that surely Sophia meant to return the favor by using her body to work. With that understanding, she turned a smile towards Sophia who wasn’t reading the atmosphere.<br/>
「Is that so……well, I will temporarily consider it a pass for now. Sophia-san, best regards from now on.」<br/>
「Ha, haa, is that so. Temporary pass?」<br/>
The gazes towards Lyle became even sharper after Novem’s words. Aria became tearful, while Sophia tilted her head unable to understand what Novem meant by temporarily passing for now. Zelphy looked at Lyle with a frown.<br/>
Rondo and the others were also looking coldly at Lyle. The surroundings were the same. The variety of the gazes were different, but none of them could be said as favorable.<br/>
「Eh……what’s going on? Eh, what’s this situation!?」<br/>
This day, Lyle ended up shouldering the lives of not two people, but three people──<br/>
