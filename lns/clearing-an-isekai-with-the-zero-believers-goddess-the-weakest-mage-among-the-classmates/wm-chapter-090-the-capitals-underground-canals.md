Double Sponsored Chapter!<br/>
<br/>
"This is the entrance to the underground canals… Are you really going?" <br/>
The boy from the orphanage who guided us there had an uneasy expression.<br/>
"It is okay. If it looks dangerous, we will go back immediately." (Makoto)<br/>
"So you say, but you have excitement written in your face." (Aya)<br/>
It looks like it was clear to the eye of Sa-san.<br/>
The place we arrived at was at the ends of the city, a place that’s like a big water well.<br/>
I peek at the circular hole made of stone blocks, and it seems to connect deep underground.<br/>
In order to go down, you have to use a rusted ladder.<br/>
"Then, we will be going now." (Aya)<br/>
"Be careful…"<br/>
Sa-san and I enter the underground canals while being seen off by the boy.<br/>
◇◇<br/>
 "Ah! …Sa-san, are you okay?" (Makoto)<br/>
There’s little light sources in the underground canals, and it is practically pitch black.<br/>
I have [Nightvision], so I can see though.<br/>
"Eh? I can see as normal. It is brighter than in Laberintos." (Aya)<br/>
"Ah, that so." (Makoto)<br/>
As expected of a Lamia (reincarnated) born in Laberintos and raised there.<br/>
Her body specs are on a whole other level.<br/>
"But that’s a relief. They said it was a drainage facility, I was imagining a more dirty place, but the water is pretty." (Aya)<br/>
"It is something created by dragging the water of the Saint Ruin River that’s flowing horizontally from Symphonia after all. The downstream is connected to the sea." (Makoto)<br/>
"Is that so." (Aya)<br/>
We move through the underground canals slowly.<br/>
By the way, I am holding hands with Sa-san.<br/>
Her hand is as cold as usual.<br/>
"This Water Movement magic is handy. But are there no monsters inside the water? Like a Sea Serpent or something." (Aya)<br/>
"Sa-san…this isn’t Laberintos." (Makoto)<br/>
There’s no way there would be a strong monster like that here. <br/>
They have a monster repelling barrier after all.<br/>
"There’s apparently only weak Class 0 creatures here." (Makoto)<br/>
"Class 0?" (Aya)<br/>
"The danger class of monsters. The Adventurer Guild sets them." (Makoto)<br/>
Since there’s the chance, I explain the class divisions in the strengths of the monsters. <br/>
– Monster Danger Level – Recommended Adventurer Rank<br/>
Class 0: Harmless – Even regular people can defeat them.<br/>
Class 1: Danger Level Low – Stone Rank Recommended.<br/>
Class 2: Danger Level Mid – Bronze Rank Recommended<br/>
Class 3: Danger Level High – Iron Rank Recommended<br/>
Class 4: Calamity Designation Village – Gold and Silver Rank Recommended<br/>
Class 5: Calamity Designation Town – Platinum Rank Recommended<br/>
Class 6: Calamity Designation Country – Mythril Rank Recommended<br/>
Class 7: Calamity Designation Continent – Hero and Orichalcum Rank Recommended<br/>
Class 8: Calamity Designation World – Bring Savior Abel-sama!<br/>
"Huuh, it was so detailedly set, huh." (Aya)<br/>
Sa-san said, impressed.<br/>
"By the way, you are a Calamity Designation, Sa-san." (Makoto)<br/>
"Fuh?!" (Aya)<br/>
She is crazy surprised.<br/>
It seems she wasn’t aware.<br/>
Sa-san doesn’t notice her own strength after all.<br/>
There’s small routes of 2-3 meters in width, and medium routes of more than 5 meters that are branched a whole lot.<br/>
We advance carefully while I use [Mapping].<br/>
There’s no monsters so, different from a dungeon, it is peaceful.<br/>
What we should be careful about is encountering the Snake Church or the mafia, so we have to make it so they don’t find us.<br/>
We haven’t met anyone for now.<br/>
We were leisurely moving through the underground canals, but…<br/>
"Sa-san, stop." (Makoto)<br/>
There was a reaction from [Detection].<br/>
"Yeah, I can hear footsteps. Moreover, several of them." (Aya)<br/>
We activate [Stealth] and hide in the shadows.<br/>
Did we get it?<br/>
Is it the Snake Church?<br/>
We held our breath, and waited for the enemies.<br/>
*Clank Clank*<br/>
Noisy footsteps.<br/>
They appeared.<br/>
They have human shape, but there’s no meat in their body.<br/>
Beings that can move despite being only bones.<br/>
Undead.<br/>
(Skeletons?!) (Makoto)<br/>
(There are monsters here, Takatsuki-kun!) (Aya)<br/>
 This is weird…<br/>
What happened to the monster repelling barrier?<br/>
(What should we do, Takatsuki-kun?) (Aya)<br/>
(Hmm, we could ignore them.) (Makoto)<br/>
The rule in conquering a dungeon is usually to defeat as many monsters you meet.<br/>
It is in order to avoid getting pincered. <br/>
‘Always make sure to secure an escape path’, is what the veteran adventurer, Lucas-san, warned me a lot of times.<br/>
"Let’s defeat them, Sa-san." (Makoto)<br/>
"Understood, Takatsuki-kun." (Aya)<br/>
The underground canals have a lot of water that serves as my weapon.<br/>
Fortunately, there’s a decent amount of Spirits too.<br/>
"Water Magic: [Ice Floor]." (Makoto)<br/>
I freeze the ground and take the footing of the skeletons.<br/>
There’s 3.<br/>
I thought about defeating them one by one, but…<br/>
"Hoito." (Aya)<br/>
Sa-san smashes the 3 monsters all at once with her gigantified hammer.<br/>
Cracking sounds were made as the skeletons were smashed to pieces.<br/>
"Uwaah…" (Makoto)<br/>
"Eh? Is that it?" (Aya)<br/>
"Well, as you can see." (Makoto)<br/>
The bones that were formerly skeletons had been smashed onto the wall in pieces.<br/>
No turn for me.<br/>
…Let’s move on.<br/>
After that, what showed up were…<br/>
"Skeletons, skeletons, zombies, skeletons…there’s quite a lot." (Makoto)<br/>
"All undead…" (Aya)<br/>
Sa-san mutters with a weary expression.<br/>
Sa-san defeated them all with one hit.<br/>
Yeah, handy.<br/>
But what bothers me is that…<br/>
"They were all acting in groups of 3." (Makoto)<br/>
"It is…not a coincidence, right?" (Aya)<br/>
"Probably. Someone might be commanding them." (Makoto)<br/>
Having groups of 3 is apparently common sense in this continent’s army.<br/>
Controlling skeletons and zombies is part of the moon element, necromancy.<br/>
Meaning that there’s a necromancer somewhere controlling them?<br/>
"Does it have to do with the devilkin…with the Snake Church?" (Makoto)<br/>
"Wouldn’t it be better to go back, Takatsuki-kun?" (Aya)<br/>
Sa-san has been unbeatable for a while now, but she recommends withdrawing.<br/>
She seems uneasy.<br/>
It is true that I would like to avoid encountering even stronger monsters in higher numbers.<br/>
Let’s go back…is what I wanted to say, but…<br/>
"S-Someone!! Damn it, these guys…!" <br/>
We heard the scream of a man.<br/>
In this suspicious place where there’s a whole lot of undead around, someone is asking for help?<br/>
It definitely isn’t decent…<br/>
What to do…<br/>
"Takatsuki-kun, let’s go!" (Aya)<br/>
Ah, you don’t just watch and see huh, Sa-san.<br/>
How manly.<br/>
We headed to the direction of the voice.<br/>
"Hiiiiiiiih!" <br/>
A young man was surrounded by skeletons and zombies.<br/>
Oi oi oi, we were just barely in time.<br/>
"Water Magic: [Water Dragon]!" (Makoto)<br/>
The target of the magic is…the man that has been surrounded.<br/>
"Uwaaaah!" <br/>
The magic I shot hits only the man and takes him away.<br/>
The skeletons and zombies remained.<br/>
I draw the man over to where we are.<br/>
"Sa-san!" (Makoto)<br/>
"Okay~." (Aya)<br/>
*Pang!*<br/>
The full swing of Sa-san’s giant hammer sends the undead flying.<br/>
There were around 20.<br/>
"Done~." (Aya)<br/>
"Fast!" (Makoto)<br/>
It ended in less than 1 minute.<br/>
"What about the person who was attacked by the monsters?" (Aya)<br/>
"He fainted. Ooi, wake up~." (Makoto)<br/>
I slap the young man’s cheek.<br/>
<br/>
From what I see, he is around 20 years old and on his head there’s the ears of a dog…or maybe a wolf? <br/>
It is dark so I can’t see well, but the clothes he is wearing seem expensive.<br/>
This attire, even though it is the 9th District.<br/>
Suspicious…<br/>
"…Ugh, what happened to me? Did I die?" <br/>
"You are alive." (Makoto)<br/>
"W-Who are you people?!" <br/>
The man takes distance, and then, after seeing the pieces of skeletons and zombies at the back of Sa-san, his face dyed in shock.<br/>
"You defeated them all?!" <br/>
"Sa-san here did." (Makoto)<br/>
"You guys, just who…no, you saved me. Thanks." <br/>
"No no, don’t mind it." (Aya)<br/>
Sa-san returns her giant hammer to a small size.<br/>
Now then…what to do with this person?<br/>
Is he from the Snake Church? Mafia? Thief? A regular citizen?<br/>
…The last one is impossible.<br/>
"My name is Peter Castor. You can call me Brother if you want." <br/>
He introduces himself with a smile.<br/>
What a pompous man.<br/>
In a japanese way of saying it, it would be gaudy.<br/>
"So he says, Sa-san." (Makoto)<br/>
"You are the leader of our party, Takatsuki-kun." (Aya)<br/>
The one who defeated most of the monsters was you, Sa-san.<br/>
"I am Takatsuki Makoto, the one here is my comrade, Sasaki Aya. We are adventurers of the Water Country of Rozes." (Makoto)<br/>
Let’s not mention that I am a Hero.<br/>
"Why is an adventurer of Rozes here? …Ah, you are subjugating monsters? Thanks to that, you saved me. The Adventurer Guild is fast!" (Peter)<br/>
Peter-san seems to have reached a conclusion of his own and nodded.<br/>
Looks like he isn’t suspecting us.<br/>
I can’t just suddenly ask ‘do you know the Snake Church?’, so for now, I begin by having some casual talk.<br/>
"Do monsters show up often in the underground canals?" (Makoto)<br/>
"Oi oi oi! There’s no way that’s the case. The underground canals have been my playground since my childhood, and this is the first time I see undead showing up!" (Peter)<br/>
Looks like it isn’t common to have monsters here.<br/>
Something strange is happening.<br/>
"But we defeated about 10 groups of skeletons and zombies before arriving here, you know." (Aya)<br/>
"How can this be?! Is that true, young girl?! Then, I won’t be able to use this place for transactions in the future!" (Peter)<br/>
Peter-san held his head in agony at the words of Sa-san.<br/>
This person’s every movement is like an over-reaction.<br/>
"We are about to leave. Want to come with us?" (Makoto)<br/>
"Ooh! That would help out a lot. I was together with some comrades, but we ended up separating after being attacked by monsters." (Peter)<br/>
Peter-san says happily.<br/>
"Is it okay to not search for them?" (Makoto)<br/>
"I became a decoy and pulled the monsters, so they should have been able to run away." (Peter)<br/>
"I see." (Makoto)<br/>
What camaraderie.<br/>
We met in a weird place like this, but he might not be that bad of a person.<br/>
"Then, let’s go." (Makoto)<br/>
"I will guide you. I have been playing here since childhood, so I know all the shortcuts." (Peter)<br/>
Peter-san says proud.<br/>
…Isn’t this supposed to be a place that children shouldn’t get close to?<br/>
◇◇<br/>
"Hoi." (Aya)<br/>
Sa-san swung her giant hammer, and the monsters were sent flying.<br/>
"That lady is strong, amazing. The monsters are turned to smithereens!" (Peter)<br/>
Peter-san raised a shout of excitement.<br/>
"But Takatsuki-kun is stronger~." (Aya)<br/>
Sa-san returns while making her hammer smaller.<br/>
Eh, wait! Don’t say random stuff!<br/>
"Wow, Brother! What rank are you?" (Peter)<br/>
"Silver Rank, mid tier adventurer. Sa-san is just flattering me here." (Makoto)<br/>
I show my silver badge and explain.<br/>
"By the way, Peter-san, what were you doing in the underground canals?" (Makoto)<br/>
I try probing him in this talk we have.<br/>
"Oi oi, no need for the -san! Peter is fine, Brother! We came here to meet up with someone for business related reasons, but the person didn’t show up and monsters did. What a terrible day. But thanks to the lady and Brother, it has turned around! Thanks, Goddess Ira-sama." (Peter)<br/>
Peter offered a prayer to the necklace crafted in the form of a big money sign. <br/>
(It is clear that he is not from the Snake Church now.) (Makoto)<br/>
The Snake Church believes in the Demon God King, Typhon.<br/>
And according to Noah-sama, the pious believers wouldn’t pray to other Gods even as an act.<br/>
(The Goddess Ira is the Goddess that rules over luck and business. Most of the believers are merchants…) (Makoto)<br/>
"That was unfortunate, Peter. Is the exit over here?" (Makoto)<br/>
"Yeah, it is here. No doubt about it." (Peter)<br/>
We came out from an exit that was slightly apart from the place where we entered.<br/>
"Bright." "My eyes aren’t used to it yet." <br/>
Sa-san and I came from the pitch black water canal to the bright surface, and covered our eyes with our hands.<br/>
I want sunglasses.<br/>
"Haha! Brother, this is necessary when coming out from the underground canals, you know." (Peter)<br/>
When I looked, Peter had sunglasses.<br/>
Oi! You have sunglasses, Isekai?<br/>
Well, colored eyeglasses shouldn’t be that weird of a thing, huh.<br/>
"Young master!" "You are okay?!" "Were you hurt?!" "Who are you guys?!" "What did you do to the young master?!" <br/>
Geh! Tall built men with things like tattoos and hairdos appeared! <br/>
Everyone has sunglasses! <br/>
Who are these people?<br/>
"You guys! These people are my benefactors who saved my life at the underground canals! Don’t be rude to them!" (Peter)<br/>
His lighthearted atmosphere of before disappeared, and he shouted with a powerful tone.<br/>
""""Apologies, young master!"""" <br/>
""Eh?""<br/>
Sa-san and I look at Peter dumbfounded.<br/>
"Sorry, Brother! I don’t have time today, but I want to thank you another day. I will lend you this as proof of that promise." (Peter)<br/>
Saying this, he gave me a golden badge with some sort of crest in it.<br/>
"See ya, Brother! Let’s meet again!" (Peter)<br/>
Peter left surrounded by the tall black clothed men.<br/>
""…""<br/>
Sa-san and I were left there in shock.<br/>
"Hey, Takatsuki-kun…" (Aya)<br/>
Yeah, I understand what you want to say.<br/>
"Peter was a young mafia boss, huh…" (Makoto)<br/>
Looks like the Goddess Ira-sama is popular not only to merchants but the mafia and thieves too.<br/>
"Takatsuki-kun…what’s a young boss?" (Aya)<br/>
"Who knows… It is apparently a position in the mafia at the movie I saw before." (Makoto)<br/>
"I see. What do we do now?" (Aya)<br/>
"…Let’s go back." (Makoto)<br/>
"…Okay." (Aya)<br/>
In the end, we returned to the inn without getting a clue about the Snake Church.<br/>
What was waiting for me after returning was an order to head to the Highland Castle.<br/>
