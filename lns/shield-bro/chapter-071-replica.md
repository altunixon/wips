Replica<br/>
Edited by: EverydaySoCloudy<br/>
<br/>
Pope: "Well then, time to end the little test here. I shall start taking this seriously."<br/>
The pope readies his sword.<br/>
Then, the form changes to a spear, the shape changed while retaining its luxurious design.<br/>
Looking at the weapons, you can tell it was made by the same person.<br/>
Naofumi: "It can transform!?"<br/>
Pope: "Of course, it is a legendary weapon after all. Sword, spear, and bow…… What shall I purify you with?"<br/>
Holy weapon of the Three Legendary Heroes……?<br/>
The power of Three Legendary Heroes merged together in to one weapon turns its fangs against the Hero of the Shield.<br/>
That is quite the composition.<br/>
Even if I tried to escape……Can it even be done against an opponent who wields such a weapon?<br/>
That shock-wave was too fast to dodge.<br/>
If he takes this seriously and uses a bow skill, it might even be impossible for Firo to escape……<br/>
Pope: "You see, our power from the believers is limited. So allow me to end this with a single blow."<br/>
The knights are wholeheartedly supporting the Pope in the background.<br/>
The weapon was pointed towards us.<br/>
The replica spear shines and from the light transforms into a three-pronged spear.<br/>
Motoyasu: "…… High Class Skill, Brionac!?"<br/>
Hero of the Spear Motoyasu cries out.<br/>
It is probably a skill name from a game which Motoyasu has played.<br/>
That means this is a considerably high-class skill.<br/>
It would normally do an enormous amount of damage, will the skill kill us……?<br/>
Escaping is impossible, I have to block it…… Motoyasu and the others are unable to, only the shield can.<br/>
Is this move going to attack from all sides?<br/>
No matter what I have no intention of giving up.<br/>
Naofumi: "Firo!"<br/>
Firo: "Okay!"<br/>
Firo grasps my intention and throws me directly at the pope.<br/>
The moment the pope entered the range of my skill. I shouted its name.<br/>
Naofumi: "Shield Prison!"<br/>
A cage of shields imprisons the pope.<br/>
After I will use Change Shield (Attack) then Iron Maiden will surely kill him-<br/>
Pope: "……What kind of imitation is this?"<br/>
He didn’t even need to take a posture, the prison was destroyed merely by the skill’s after effect.<br/>
No way!?<br/>
No, I need to calm down and think about this.<br/>
The requirements to activate Iron Maiden weren’t met, and it’s my only other means of attacking.<br/>
I’ll just burn him with Self-Burning Curse.<br/>
However, he grips the spear and begins his attack.<br/>
I think not.<br/>
Naofume: "Firo, Throw Motoyasu at me!"<br/>
Motoyasu: "Eh!?"<br/>
Firo: "Okay!"<br/>
Motoyasu who hasn’t landed yet is hurled towards me by Firo.<br/>
Motoyasu: "Dowaaaaaaaaaaaaa!"<br/>
Motoyasu shouts in panic while flying towards me at a high-speed.<br/>
Naofumi: "Motoyasu attack me!"<br/>
Motoyasu: "Ahhh!? Oh I see, okay!"<br/>
Motoyasu turns out to be quite sharp.<br/>
While I turn around Motoyasu readies his spear.<br/>
And with a thud the spear hits my shield.<br/>
That’s right.<br/>
This is good.<br/>
Motoyasu: "Meteor Spear!"<br/>
Next, Motoyasu releases his skill towards the Pope.<br/>
Pope: "Foolish."<br/>
However, Motoyasu’s meteor spear was stopped by an unknown barrier around the pope.<br/>
Motoyasu: "What!?"<br/>
Naofumi: "Now try this!"<br/>
With me at the centre, the Self-Burning Curse flames fly out and engulfs the pope, Motoyasu is also hit.<br/>
The barrier surrounding the Pope suddenly vanishes and the flames–<br/>
Pope: "It’s useless!"<br/>
The believers accompanying the Pope immediately begin chanting in unison.<br/>
Knights: """Our god commands the origin of power. I have read and deciphered a law of nature. Purify this curse with a miracle!"""<br/>
Knights: "High Class Purification Magic [Sanctuary]!"<br/>
The area was dyed pure-white and my Self-Burning Curse was instantly removed.<br/>
No way!?<br/>
Certainly the curse power conflicts with holy power.<br/>
Was I deceived into buying holy water? Oh well, it did do enough.<br/>
High Class Holy Water should still be required to completely cure the curse.<br/>
But instantly…….<br/>
Naofumi: "Air Strike Shield! Second Shield!"<br/>
Before reaching the Pope I called the shields as a foothold, Motoyasu and I both use it to back off.<br/>
It seems the flames that also burnt Motoyasu were purified.<br/>
There is nothing I haven’t used yet.<br/>
Naofumi: "Okay. Motoyasu’s companion heal us with recovery magic."<br/>
Woman: "R-right! Tzuvait ・Heal!"<br/>
Motoyasu’s wounds healed considerably.<br/>
This is becoming quite useful.<br/>
What’s sad is that I’m forced to work with Motoyasu.<br/>
Pope: "Now then, are you finished with your farce? I would like to attack now."<br/>
As the Pope begins to activate a skill, the tip of his spear glows.<br/>
Pope: "This is as far as you go. I bid the devil and the imposter good-bye."<br/>
The spear shines even brighter than before and the pope smiles at us. His attitude is as if he completed an exorcism.<br/>
Firo: "Mel-chan!"<br/>
Firo instantly covers Melty. Raphtalia grasps my hand.<br/>
Motoyasu: "So this is it……"<br/>
Motoyasu mutters as if he has given up.<br/>
Malty: "I-I am going to become the queen of this country! How dare you be so rude-"<br/>
The bitch is screaming before death.<br/>
Motoyasu’s companions begin to lose their composure and breaks down crying.<br/>
Is there any possibility that I can withstand this?……<br/>
It’s sink or swim, with nothing to lose, I step forward.<br/>
Of course I would rather not defend those guys.<br/>
I just want to protect Raphtalia, Firo, and Melty, they are the ones who have believed in me.<br/>
I ready my shield and step forward.<br/>
Raphtalia: "I’ll accompany you."<br/>
Raphtalia follows me as I step forward. With her hand on mine.<br/>
We’ve gotten this far together.<br/>
I was brought to this world against my will and became the devil of the shield, and was forced to buy a slave to become my fighting force.<br/>
Of course even to now there is no sense of guilt.<br/>
Still, even in those days she believed in me.<br/>
Naofumi: "I’m sorry……To bring you to such a place……"<br/>
Raphtalia: "No, Naofumi-sama I believe you can protect us all."<br/>
Motoyasu: "……That’s right. I don’t know how the previous Hero of the spear was, but this is definitely one of his skills."<br/>
Not yet, I will not be finished in such a place.<br/>
The chance to finally counter-attack the mastermind is right in front of me.<br/>
Brionac……I’m not sure which Celtic Myth it is from, but I will stop it.<br/>
The Pope raises the spear towards the sky–<br/>
Ren: "Hundred Sword!"<br/>
Itsuki: "Meteor Bow!"<br/>
Suddenly, a wave of swords and arrows rain down on to the Pope.<br/>
Pope: "What’s going on!?"<br/>
Since I broke down the Pope’s barrier, he was forced to stop casting his skill and twirl the spear around to deflect all the swords and arrows.<br/>
I turn my gaze to where the voice came from. There I see-<br/>
"Oh my. You two should have already been purified by the judgement of god, why are you here?"<br/>
Ren and Itsuki are standing in a line with their parties.<br/>
Ren: "Don’t just kill me off without my permission. In the first place did you even confirm our corpses?"<br/>
Itsuki: "That was a close call. I barely made it in time."<br/>
Ren and Itsuki call out to us while preparing for battle.<br/>
Pope: "Oh dear, if there was even a need to confirm your bodies, then there would have been no reason to use that magic."<br/>
I look to where the attack previously landed.<br/>
Certainly, there is a slim chance of even finding a corpse within the crater.<br/>
Not even a trace would remain.<br/>
But I endured it though.<br/>
When looking at Ren my body feels heavy.<br/>
The shield makes a commotion about who I should be directing my hatred towards.<br/>
The rage of the dragon is producing anger meant for Ren.<br/>
I have to endure it…… I cannot act violently now.<br/>
Motoyasu: "You guys, how did you……"<br/>
Motoyasu is looking at Ren and Itsuki like he’s looking at dead people.<br/>
Well Motoyasu isn’t wrong, it’s definitely strange that all the heroes have gathered in such a remote area.<br/>
The last time I saw them was in the opposite direction heading towards Silt Welt.<br/>
Ren: "A group called shadow helped us."<br/>
Itsuki: "Yeah, it was a close call."<br/>
Motoyasu: "Eh? Did a guy called shadow tell you about Naofumi’s whereabouts?"<br/>
Ren: "He said that he was on the church’s side."<br/>
If I think about it, it’s strange that they’re able to predict our escape route and lay an ambush.<br/>
In other words, Motoyasu was able to pinpoint my location thanks to the help from the shadows on the Three Heroes Church.<br/>
We also met a shadow during out escape.<br/>
That reminds me……<br/>
Naofumi: "…… I was told the shadows are splintered."<br/>
Ren: "Yeah, the shadows who saved our lives said they worked for the queen."<br/>
I see, the queen’s shadows are collaborating.<br/>
I’ll assume that the shadows who helped Itsuki and Ren are from the queen’s faction.<br/>
Is this because the queen has a hostile relationship with the pope?<br/>
At least now the queen and the four heroes are hostile against the Pope and his Three Heroes Church.<br/>
However……These guys look like they came from an old weekly manga.<br/>
It’s like they were waiting for the perfect timing to appear.<br/>
The leader of the heroes side is Motoyasu.<br/>
The Arch-enemy position is me……? I’m not kidding.<br/>
Is it possible to clear up the misunderstanding if I had a companion character there? Like in the manga.<br/>
Unfortunately, I have no intentions of becoming a companion of Motoyasu or any of them……<br/>
Ren: "A punitive force will be arriving soon! Surrender quietly!"<br/>
Ren declares as if he already won.<br/>
However, the pope doesn’t seem to be worried at all.<br/>
Pope: "Our victory is certain no matter how many you bring. No matter what the armed forces bring they’re just numbers, its meaningless!"<br/>
The pope gets in position to activate his skill again.<br/>
Ren: "I wonder about that"<br/>
Itsuki: "Of course."<br/>
The two heroes both shoot a skill at the pope.<br/>
Ren: "Meteor Sword!"<br/>
Itsuki: "Metero Bow!"<br/>
Arrows and Swords made of light head directly towards the Pope—<br/>
<br/>
