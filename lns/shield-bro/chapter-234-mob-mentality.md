Chapter 234: Mob Mentality<br/>
As I approach the city, I could see fires blazing even from afar.<br/>
The people were not evacuating. They were taking refuge in the mansion Melty was using as her residence on the outskirts of the village.<br/>
The Justice Zombies were attacking while shouting out negative propaganda about me and the country.<br/>
These brainwashed people would usually be difficult to distinguish at a glance.<br/>
However, if they took a sufficient amount of damage, and the host’s consciousness faded, then the bodies would continue to walk around like typical zombies without wills.<br/>
Their behavior is also a problem.<br/>
The situation has devolved as such: The zombies would attempt to climb the stone walls surrounding the mansion, while the people inside would knock them down with wind magic or physical force.<br/>
And within the fire, Ren and Firo were taking the initiative, going around and knocking out the insurgents.<br/>
The others would then use rope to tie them up.<br/>
"Are you alright!?" (Naofumi)<br/>
"Ah, Master~! Well, you see…" (Firo)<br/>
"Naofumi, how did your side go? Did you find Itsuki?" (Ren)<br/>
"No." (Naofumi)<br/>
I summarize the events of the village while I step in front to act as the shield I am.<br/>
These brainwashed people should have a sense of priority instilled within them.<br/>
They should be prioritizing killing me or Melty.<br/>
"For the sake of Justice, Perish!" (Merchant)<br/>
A merchant who had been laughing and conversing with me just yesterday thrusts a dagger at me.<br/>
And without a word, I activated Erst Strike Shield and Change Shield, creating a combo that inflicted Paralysis.<br/>
"What about the people you’re supposed to be protecting?" (Naofumi)<br/>
"Ah, this kid says that matter is fine." (Ren)<br/>
"Well, you see. I somehow know." (Firo)<br/>
I see, so Firo can sense it with her feral instincts.<br/>
She can sense the actions of the other Filo Rials and their support.<br/>
"And this is that dagger?" (Ren)<br/>
"Yeah." (Naofumi)<br/>
I take out the dagger and present it to Ren.<br/>
Of course, in order for him to analyze it.<br/>
Trying to insert it into my shield seems dangerous, so I’ll have Ren make a Copy of it.<br/>
It’s a dangerous item, but if he makes it his own… It might be fine.<br/>
"Try holding it for a second." (Naofumi)<br/>
"Okay." (Ren)<br/>
Ren grasps the hilt of the dagger, and his sword shines for a moment.<br/>
"Curse Series… The Dagger of Mob Mentality?" (Ren)<br/>
So it comes down to that.<br/>
And wait, it’s a Curse Series?<br/>
There’s more than the 7 Deadly Sins?<br/>
I see, so this dagger makes one’s mind a single part of a whole and prevents an individual from making decisions on their own.<br/>
"Wait a second… Let me check it for more details." (Ren)<br/>
Ren opens his status screen and reads through it.<br/>
"I apologize, I don’t really know what this is supposed to mean." (Ren)<br/>
He answers as he knocks down several zombies with his sword.<br/>
"Does it have any strange effects?"<br/>
"Equipment Bonus… Release by Brainwashing; Mutual Understanding; Don’t worry, I understand you."<br/>
… That’s seriously suspicious.<br/>
Ren probably thinks so as well. He has a complicated expression.<br/>
"This is Release? Mutual Understanding? Can you even call that understanding?" (Ren)<br/>
"Does it mean your troubles will fade away?" (Naofumi)<br/>
So it stains you with the ideology of another…<br/>
Anyone who objects to that psychology is an enemy, and if you infect them, they’ll be comrades once more.<br/>
This isn’t a game…<br/>
This is quite a disgusting dagger.<br/>
"Where is Eclaire-san?"<br/>
Rishia looks around and asks Ren.<br/>
Eclaire… Is that Female Knight?<br/>
She’s probably being useful around now.<br/>
I mean, the girl knows nothing but how to fight.<br/>
"Ah, she is…" (Ren)<br/>
Ren’s face darkens.<br/>
And he points to the mansion.<br/>
"Is she defending from the mansion?" (Rishia)<br/>
"It seems that she received quite a shock upon seeing the strange actions and speech of the enemy." (Ren)<br/>
"What?" (Naofumi)<br/>
"How can I get them to understand me? The Justice I seek is nothing like this. She couldn’t raise her hands against her former comrades." (Ren)<br/>
Ah, Female Knight had a strong sense of justice.<br/>
If the enemy takes on the name of Justice and spouts incomprehensible nonsense, I guess she would get mad.<br/>
The citizens she vowed to protect were fighting her.<br/>
Though they were being controlled by others, they still maintained some of their selves. It would be impossible to attack at full power.<br/>
They may even pretend to be allies.<br/>
This possibility could lead to suspicion and infighting.<br/>
This really is an annoying ability.<br/>
"’A world without Slavery or Discrimination. An equal world,’ she said as the amount of turned allies around her increased. It must have been tough." (Ren)<br/>
Well, she does have a point.<br/>
In this country’s eyes, it is impossible for humans and Demi-Humans to live side by side. If a Demi-Human is officially treated as an equal, then people accuse the government of giving them preferential treatment.<br/>
One side says that I’m doing the brainwashing, while they spread their argument through brainwashing. There’s no end to it.<br/>
This village had no one who could undo the brainwashing, so there’s no helping it.<br/>
Equal? No Discrimination? Those are some expressions that make me sick to my stomach.<br/>
Even in my ‘equal’ world, there’s been no one who’s been able to practice true equality.<br/>
Superiority exists in all worlds.<br/>
When someone is born, he’s already being judged. Equality is a laughable concept.<br/>
(TL Note: Yoraikun does not endorse any views offered by our protagonist. )<br/>
The quest to make an impartial, equal world without war is merely a trigger to unleash more war.<br/>
It’s like when she beat up and performed minorly tortured Ren in order to teach him a lesson.<br/>
Anyways, what does the word Equality even mean?<br/>
The meaning I know has all humans treated equally without discrimination or favorable treatment.<br/>
It’s unattainable and merely something to be strived for.<br/>
But in a world with Slavery as a set system, if such things are preached, no one will lend their ears.<br/>
My world only got rid of slavery recently.<br/>
If anyone actually supported such a cause, they would have ulterior motives.<br/>
And the reason slavery became extinct in my world was largely due to the changing times; slaves were no longer needed. (TL: He’s talking about Japan here)<br/>
This world is still in need of some form of labor.<br/>
To try and preach such a concept that’s realistically impossible, I can only see her as a child.<br/>
That’s a concept that the Three Heroes Church and the Revolutionary faction would simply use to their advantage.<br/>
"I’ll put lecturing Female Knight off to a later date. Do you think we’ll be able to manage here?" (Naofumi)<br/>
"The enemy numbers are too great. At this rate, we can tie all of them up, but it will take too long." (Ren)<br/>
"I see…" (Naofumi)<br/>
Even if the people I brought along also fight, it will still take a long time.<br/>
"Naofumi-cha~n." (Sadina)<br/>
… Ah, right. Sadina was with us.<br/>
"Hey… Sadina. Do you have a way to take out the overflowing mass of brainwashed children and put out the fire all at once?" (Naofumi)<br/>
"Leave it to me! Everyone!" (Sadina)<br/>
Sadina began swinging her harpoon like a conductor’s baton.<br/>
Perhaps because she brought along more people this time, I can feel the magic in the air condensing to greater levels than before. It’s already a large scale magic formation.<br/>
Ah, this person is comparable to Firo in useful abilities.<br/>
Hm? Firo?<br/>
"Firo, mobilize the other Filo Rials to cast Choral Magic as well!" (Naofumi)<br/>
"Got it~! N… Nn…" (Firo)<br/>
Firo cleared her throat and began singing.<br/>
And in response to that, the other Filo Rials in the area began chirping.<br/>
"Naofumi-chan, go evacuate the children who aren’t brainwashed." (Sadina)<br/>
"Understood." (Naofumi)<br/>
By my orders, I evacuated everyone who was still sane.<br/>
I won’t let the situation devolve to the level it was before.<br/>
"Wait!"<br/>
"Submit to the will of justice!"<br/>
"Devil of the Shield!"<br/>
All the brainwashed people say the same things.<br/>
"Ren!" (Naofumi)<br/>
"Leave it to me! 「Hundred Sword!」" (Ren)<br/>
The pursuing slaves are blocked by countless strikes from Ren’s area of effect skill.<br/>
Heroes with offensive capabilities sure are useful.<br/>
「「「Tidal Wave!」」」<br/>
「「「Sweet Song!」」」<br/>
Upon Sadina’s magic, a large wave washes away the Justice Zombies in front of the mansion, and upon hearing Firo’s song, other Zombies turn white-eyed and fall down on the spot.<br/>
It’s probably a magic with a sleep effect.<br/>
It seems that Firo’s singing ability has reached magical levels.<br/>
"I guess that we succeeded in the surpression for now." (Naofumi)<br/>
"No, not yet." (Ren)<br/>
Ren points deeper into the city.<br/>
And from that direction, Brainwashed Zombies continue to pour in, one after the other.<br/>
Where the hell did these people come from anyways!?<br/>
They must have grown in number from the inhabitants of this village.<br/>
"… The person leading all of them probably isn’t here." (Naofumi)<br/>
In a situation like this, the person leading the charge, like the Magic User in my village, probably retreated already.<br/>
"No, there’s one suspicious place." (Ren)<br/>
Ren signals towards the village plaza.<br/>
Hm? For some reason, I see a Gaelion-like object breathing fire all over the place.<br/>
On its back is someone who looks like Taniko.<br/>
"Naofumi, there was a church built behind there, right?" (Ren)<br/>
"Yeah." (Naofumi)<br/>
"The Brainwashed army’s built up their defenses there. We can almost break through. Won’t you come with us?" (Ren)<br/>
"I see." (Naofumi)<br/>
Itsuki may be there. Maybe…<br/>
"We’re going over to the church. You guys should continue to bind the defeated enemies. Find a way to contain them all." (Naofumi)<br/>
"Understood, Naofumi-chan." (Sadina)<br/>
Yeah, it’s best to leave the defenses to her.<br/>
It would be bad if we thinned our forces enough for them to break through.<br/>
And the constant battle has fatigued both sides.<br/>
Just raising one’s level doesn’t change sustained injury, fatigue, or hunger.<br/>
"Then Firo and the Filo Rials will go over to where Gaelion is fighting!" (Naofumi)<br/>
"Eh?… I have to go to Gaelion?" (Firo)<br/>
Firo states her opinion.<br/>
It seems the other Filo Rials agree.<br/>
"Just shut up and go." (Naofumi)<br/>
"Oka~y…" (Firo)<br/>
"Is Melty alright?" (Naofumi)<br/>
"Yeah. Melty-chan is strong, so she’s fine." (Firo)<br/>
"I see. Well, she was strong enough to blow away my house." (Naofumi)<br/>
A militaristic princess… It’s a common theme in literature, but it makes me see just how much Melty has changed.<br/>
Even though I’m the cause.<br/>
But that doesn’t matter for now. I just need to find a way into the church.<br/>
I get on Firo’s back and gallantly rush onto the battlefield.<br/>
Ren is with us.<br/>
On the way, we encounter attacks from brainwashed people, but they are no match for Firo’s speed.<br/>
My place’s Filo Rials sure are high class.<br/>
Though, besides Firo’s first disciple, Motoyasu raised them all.<br/>
Is he going to become the Filo Rial Master?<br/>
What would I do if he actually becomes one…<br/>
