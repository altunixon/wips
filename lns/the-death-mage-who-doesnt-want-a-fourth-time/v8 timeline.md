This may not be very chronologically accurate. I have written under each heading with the feeling of, “I guess things happened like this.” If you are still interested, please read on.<br/>

<br/>
<br/>
The age of the gods<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
The vast black god Diachmell and the vast white god Arazan fight in an empty space with no reason for their conflict.<br/>
Rodcorte, the god of reincarnation, foresees that the two gods will become the foundation of a new world, and integrates the space into the circle of transmigration system that he manages.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
The battle between Diachmell and Arazan reaches its conclusion and both gods fall.<br/>
The eleven great gods of Lambda emerge from their remains.<br/>
The great gods use their power to create subordinate gods and familiar spirits to serve them, using Rodcorte’s circle of transmigration system to create humans, Elves, Dwarves, plants and animals.<br/>
The age of the gods begins.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
While Lambda is prospering under the gods’ rule, an army of evil gods led by the Demon King Guduranis appear from another world and begin their invasion.<br/>
Guduranis creates the Demon King’s circle of transmigration system, based on Rodcorte’s circle of transmigration system. With this, he creates monsters to do his bidding and the bidding of the evil gods that are his subordinates. The first war in Lambda begins.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
As the people of Lambda have only experienced battle in the form of contests of strength and hunting beasts, Ricklent, the genie of time and magic, borrows the knowledge of Zuruwarn, the god of space and creation, to create the Job and Skill systems.<br/>
The humans of Lambda become able to acquire the blessings of Jobs and Skills.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
The Demon King infiltrates Ricklent’s Job and Skill systems and makes alterations that allow monsters to acquire Skills, and introduces a Rank system for monsters in place of Jobs.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
The Demon King Guduranis and his subordinates create Dungeons in order to produce more soldiers.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Ricklent and Zuruwarn infiltrate the Dungeon system and make alterations that allow humans to use them to train and acquire goods.<br/>
Dungeons begin to produce various goods and treasure chests in addition to monsters.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Though the people and gods of Lambda fight bravely, they are gradually, one-sidedly cornered into an unfavorable situation. Traitors emerge, such as the boar beast-king and Luvesfol, the raging evil dragon god.<br/>
The beast god Ganpaplio is destroyed by the Demon King. This marks the first casualty among the great gods.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Zuruwarn proposes summoning champions from the foreign world of Earth. The gods who rule over the attributes each choose a champion except for Zuruwarn, who maintains the gate between Lambda and Earth.<br/>
Seven champions, including Zakkart and Bellwood, are summoned to Lambda.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Bellwood, Nineroad and Farmaun Gold stand on the frontlines and battle against the Demon King’s army. Meanwhile, Zakkart and the other creation-oriented champions try to develop new things such as firearms, but they do not have much success.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Shizarion, the god of wind and art, the Colossus god Zerno and the dragon-emperor god Marduke have their souls destroyed by the Demon King.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
The champion Zakkart attempts to persuade various evil gods of the Demon King’s army to change sides, and successfully wins over a significant number of gods.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Huge shockwaves are felt in the Demon King’s army as gods such as Fidirg, the dragon god of five sins, Merrebeveil, the evil god of slime and tentacles and Gufadgarn, the evil god of labyrinths, turn traitor.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
The champion Zakkart produces a nuclear bomb, a weapon of Earth, in Lambda. He suggests using it to defeat the Demon King. Bellwood strongly opposes this.<br/>
This disagreement creates a gulf between the three battle-oriented champions and the four creation-oriented ones.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Demon King Guduranis creates a scheme and successfully slays the four creation-oriented champions – Zakkart, Ark, Solder and Hillwillow. Their souls are destroyed.<br/>
The broken soul fragments are forcibly joined together into one soul by Rodcorte and sent to Earth.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
At the end of an all-out war against the people of Lambda who are led by Bellwood and the other battle-oriented champions, the Demon King Guduranis is defeated. His body is separated into pieces, and each piece is sealed away.<br/>
However, all of the great gods except for Alda and Vida have lost their power and fallen into slumber or been sealed away, and Lambda is left with humans, Elves and Dwarves whose combined population is a mere three thousand.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Alda, the god of light and law, and the champion Bellwood lead the path to restore the world. However, they take a policy of suppressing the knowledge brought from Earth and allow Lambda to develop independently as they restore nature. They request Vida and her subordinates to destroy the records and technology left behind by Zakkart and the other creation-oriented champions.<br/>
This is the final nail in the coffin for Vida’s trust towards Alda and Bellwood; she leaves Alda along with the gods who agree with her and a little over a hundred loyal believers.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
On the Bahn Gaia continent, separate from the continent on which Alda and his allies work to restore humanity, Vida creates her own plan to restore the world by creating new races. She turns Zakkart’s remains into an Undead and, using Zakkart’s knowledge and relics that Gufadgarn kept in his possession, she begins her plan.<br/>
At the same time, she tries to resurrect Zakkart, but to no avail. As his soul no longer exists, even the root of life is of no use.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Vida unites with Zantark, who has lost his sanity after fusing with evil gods.<br/>
Vida’s numerous new races are born, the last of which are the True Ancestor Vampire and the founder of the Ghouls. One hundred of Vida’s followers receive the blessings of the True Ancestor Vampire, becoming Pure-breed Vampires. It is at this time that the humans Zorcodrio, Birkyne, Ternecia and Gubamon become Pure-breed Vampires.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
With the power of Vida, the goddess who rules over life, the gods who serve her, the ancestors of her new races and the Pure-breed Vampires, the Bahn Gaia continent becomes even more beautiful and full of life than it was before the Demon King’s army appeared.<br/>
The construction of cities begins, taking the knowledge and technology left behind by the creation-oriented champions and combining it with nature.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
A hundred years later, an army invades the Bahn Gaia continent. It is led by Bellwood and the other battle-oriented heroes, who remain young because their lifespans have been extended by Alda.<br/>
Vida is defeated and many gods are sealed away. The Undead Zakkart and the True Ancestor Vampire fall.<br/>
Vida flees with the remaining gods and the races that she created, using the last of her power to raise a part of the continent’s land to form the Boundary Mountain Range to prevent Alda’s forces from pursuing them.<br/>
Zantark successfully escapes with some of the Majin and Kijin, leading them to the Dark Continent, the entirety of which is already a Devil’s Nest at this point.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>

<br/>
Approximately 100,000 years before Volume 1 – Immediately after the conclusion of the battle between Alda and Vida, which marks the end of the age of the gods<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
As a barrier is placed around the Boundary Mountain Range, Alda gives up on attacking Vida’s faction any further.<br/>
In order to keep watch over Vida, Alda’s believers take up residence on the Bahn Gaia continent. Bellwood destroys as much of the technology and products that originated from Earth outside the Boundary Mountain Range.<br/>
Alda, the god of light and law, becomes known as the god of law and fate.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Gufadgarn builds Vida’s Resting Grounds inside the Boundary Mountain Range, while each race builds its own nation under the protection of their guardian deities.<br/>
Separated from the other gods, Fidirg, the dragon god of five sins, falls into slumber where he lies. The sun giant Talos creates a safe place to protect the Titans and Vida’s relic, the resurrection device. Having spent all his power in this way, he falls into slumber as well.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Led by Merrebeveil, the evil god of slime and tentacles, the Scylla race live outside the Boundary Mountain Range, using the mountain range itself to keep themselves hidden from Bellwood and the others.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Approximately 50,000 years before Volume 1<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>

<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
After Bellwood’s defeat, Farmaun Gold, who has also become a heroic god, feels doubt over his actions up until now. He leaves Alda’s faction.<br/>
He visits the Boundary Mountain Range, but he is unable to enter due to the barrier, so he unites with Zantark on the Dark Continent.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Ricklent, the genie of time and magic, and Zuruwarn, the god of space and creation, wake from their slumber. Upon learning of the current situation, they devote their efforts to gathering information and restoring their power.<br/>

<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Foreseeing that Vandalieu would come to this world, Ricklent works with Zuruwarn to contact Vida, Gufadgarn, Zantark and the other gods inside the Boundary Mountain Range through a Divine Message.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Upon receiving this Divine Message, Vida sends Divine Messages to several individuals, including Nuaza of the old Talosheim, to tell them of Vandalieu’s existence.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Gufadgarn slightly misinterprets the Divine Message and creates the Trial of Zakkart to search for Zakkart’s successor.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Despite receiving the Divine Message, Zantark is unable to foresee Vandalieu’s existence. However, knowing that something is about to happen, he tries to regain his power and works with Farmaun to take control of the Dark Continent that is ruled by Ravovifard, the evil god of release.<br/>

<br/>
<br/>
