"That was amazing, Alan!"<br/>
"That’s right! So magic was that amazing. I also want to learn magic as well!"<br/>
It seems Selena and Sharon were quite taken by the magic spells they saw earlier. But I was busy thinking of a way to pacify Cleria’s anger as well as a suitable explanation. <br/>
When we got back to the inn, Captain Dalshim and Baron Sergio immediately booked two separate rooms. I told Verse they were just recent acquaintances and shoved the payment for the rooms onto him before he could object.  <br/>
All of the other’s gazes turned toward me. <br/>
"I’m sorry, but can you allow Cleria and me to discuss things among ourselves first?"<br/>
"…Alright. I shall talk with you first then."<br/>
I led Cleria into my room. Man. It’s been a long time since we’ve talked with just the two of us. <br/>
"Let me apologize for what I did earlier first, Cleria. Sorry for claiming we had a plan or something to the others without consulting you first."<br/>
"Just what are you planning, Alan?"<br/>
"I’m really sorry. The reason I did so is because I thought I could use the situation to do what I wanted, no, what I needed to accomplish."<br/>
"What do you mean? You have no connection to my country, right, Alan? Just what do you mean by something you need to accomplish?"<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
"Cleria… I, no, we are planning to found a whole new country in this continent. No, it will not stop at a mere plan. We will definitely build a new country here."<br/>
"Eh!? …Founding a new country?"<br/>
"Yes. We’re going to create a new country. This is something we definitely need to accomplish at all costs. And, although it was utterly selfish and underhanded of me, I went ahead and tried to take advantage of your situation to achieve our own ends."<br/>
"When you say ‘we’, do you mean Selena and Sharon?"<br/>
"That’s right. Selena, Sharon, and me."<br/>
"Impossible… With just the three of you?"<br/>
Well, we also had Iris, the general-purpose bots, and the drones. <br/>
"Uh… We also have some other collaborators as well."<br/>
"…How many are there?"<br/>
"I cannot say how many they exactly are, but they are all dependable and powerful supporters." <br/>
"……I see. You want to create a country, so you want to use the men under me to help with that goal. Is that what you meant?"<br/>
"…That’s right. But it’s a bit different than what you’re thinking, Cleria.<br/>
First of all, I’m the one who will create a country. If you don’t want to actively participate in its creation, you don’t really have to, Cleria.<br/>
It’s just that I want you and your people to become the first citizens of the country I’ll be making in the future, if possible."<br/>
"A country Alan will create… Just how do you plan on creating a country in the first place?"<br/>
"Actually, we are already starting to build a foundation. We will first have people gather in the site we’ve chosen and then proceed to build a city there. And afterward, we will gradually expand outward."<br/>
(Iris.)<br/>
"Yes, Captain."<br/>
(How long will it take to prepare our main base of operations?)<br/>
"We have just begun construction, so I cannot yet give an accurate time frame, but I estimate it to be finished within one year."<br/>
(I see. So it’ll take a while. Understood. Thank you.)<br/>
"So where are you building your first city?"<br/>
"A place called the Great Demon Forest."<br/>
"Alan! Do you have any idea what kind of place the Great Demon Forest is!?"<br/>
"Of course I do. I’ve already investigated it. But one really can’t create an entirely new country unless you base it on an unclaimed land, right?"<br/>
"…That may be the sake. But is it really possible to build a city at that kind of place?"<br/>
"Yes, we can. You don’t have to worry about that at all. Like I said, my supporters are a bunch of powerful and reliable individuals."<br/>
"How long until that city is finished?"<br/>
"About a year or so."<br/>
"I have to ask, Alan. How do you plan on gathering citizens for your country if we were not part of the equation?" <br/>
"I’m still in the middle of thinking up plans for that. But I think becoming a noble is one viable option."<br/>
"So that’s why you asked about those things yesterday."<br/>
"That’s right. I don’t think I’ll have a problem with hunting monsters, but I’m not too sure about becoming popular and well known among the people."<br/>
"Right. I’m sure Alan will be able to defeat any kind of monster unfortunate enough to face you. ……But Alan, I’m sorry to tell you this, but I think I would have to refuse the offer of becoming the citizens of your country."<br/>
"…Can I ask about the reason?"<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
"First, even if you do manage to successfully claim lands within the Great Demon Forest and build a city there, I cannot imagine my people being able to live safely and peacefully in such a place.<br/>
It is most likely that they will face countless hardships there. I cannot allow myself to place the people in such a situation. <br/>
Secondly, the more than two thousand men I have under me are almost all former vassals of my uncle, Earl Ludvic. So I cannot imagine they will be willing to settle down on a newly founded country, even more so, under a new ruler.<br/>
The men who were formerly under the command of my uncle surely follow me mainly because they want to take back the lands they once called home. I cannot possibly betray their hopes and tell them to become your country’s citizens, Alan."<br/>
"…I failed to mention this earlier, but after founding my country, I also plan to conquer the rest of the continent as well."<br/>
"Eh!?"<br/>
"Your Starveek Kingdom. Well, now it’s called the Alois Kingdom, right? If you want that country, then I have no problem with giving it back to you. I cannot say how long it would take, but I’m sure I’ll be able to hand it over within your lifetime, Cleria."<br/>
"Are you seriously saying that, Alan!?" <br/>
"I am. I cannot be even more serious. And about the matter of moving to the new city, can you at least try to decide once you’ve seen it once? When you’ve checked it out and still feel that you don’t want to live there, then you’re free to go. It’s not that bad of a deal, right?"<br/>
"Just what is driving you to propose this crazy plan of founding your own country, Alan? You are not someone who lusts for wealth and power. I cannot think of any plausible reason for you to go as far creating your own country and conquering this continent."<br/>
"…I’m not sure if you’ll believe this, but it’s all for the safety and wellbeing of the people living in this continent."<br/>
"So you are saying you are planning to create a country and rule over the entire continent all for the sake of the people?"<br/>
"That’s right. I swear this to be the case."<br/>
"…What do you plan next after creating your country?"<br/>
"Education. I want the people to learn about the things around them, about all the underlying principles of the world, and live rich and fulfilling lives. That is the only thing I wish."<br/>
"So you mean you will build a country and conquer the continent in order to ensure the people’s happiness?" <br/>
"Yes, you can say that. Do you believe me?"<br/>
"You cannot possibly think I will easily believe something so absurd."<br/>
"Are you afraid of me becoming a tyrant?"<br/>
"I am not saying that, but…"<br/>
"If that’s the case, then how about me and Cleria co-ruling the country I will make in the future." <br/>
I don’t really care about the form of government. I only want to raise the technological prowess of this planet’s inhabitants, no, of these future imperial citizens. <br/>
"C-Co-governance!? Um, that means… um, I and Alan will…?"<br/>
"Right. We’ll work together and rule the country. However, as for the matters regarding education of the country’s citizens, I would like to have full absolute authority. And I will also not give up on the plan to unify the entire continent. Apart from these things, I don’t mind if Cleria handles the rest."<br/>
Cleria’s face suddenly turned bright red as she fidgeted bashfully. What’s going on with her?<br/>
"Um, are you really fine with me, Alan?"<br/>
Hm? What does she mean? Oh, maybe she’s not confident in herself?  The only person I can talk about things like this openly is Cleria after all. I don;t plan on entrusting something as important as this to other people apart from her.<br/>
"Of course you are. You’re the only one I can entrust these matters to, Cleria."<br/>
"I-Is that so? I didn’t realize that’s how you felt. Can you give me a little bit more time to think things through…?"<br/>
"Yes, of course. Do you want me to leave you alone for a while?"<br/>
"No, you can just sit there, Alan."<br/>
Cleria closed her eyes. Her face displayed a serious expression. After five minutes or so, she opened her eyes once more and gave me a smile. <br/>
"I have decided to accept your proposal, Lord Alan Corinth. However, I have three conditions.<br/>
First, regarding the new city you are building. I shall take you up on your offer and see the state of the city for myself before making a decision to move my people there or not. If I find that the circumstances are not ideal for my people, I reserve the right to refuse the relocation. <br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Secondly, I agree to co-governing the new country with you, and will give you complete authority over education and the plan for the unification of the continent. However, you would need to discuss things with me before making decisions regarding other matters.  <br/>
Thirdly, once the country has taken a hold of the Alois Kingdom, I would like you to leave managing that territory to me. <br/>
If you agree to the three conditions I proposed, I will offer all of my being to help you in your cause, Lord Alan. <br/>
"I promise to uphold those three conditions to the best of my ability, Lady Cleria Starvine.  ……Uh, don’t we need to keep this in writing or something? What do you think, Cleria?" <br/>
"Mou! You just had to ruin the formal and solemn atmosphere, Alan! We don’t need any record!" <br/>
"Uh, sorry. I’m not really used to this sort of thing, see."<br/>
"It would have been better if you knelt down and said"It shall be as my lady wishes."or something!"<br/>
"Is that so? Okay then. Let’s do a retake!"<br/>
"It’s fine already! We’ve already managed to settle all the important points anyway. Make sure to keep your promises, okay, Alan?"<br/>
"Of course. I don’t plan to break my promises."<br/>
I then held out my hand toward Cleria. Huh? Does this planet have no practice of handshaking? Seventy percent of human-inhabited planets in the empire are familiar with the gesture though. <br/>
"What is that supposed to mean?"<br/>
"In my home country, we would join hands whenever we finish important discussions."<br/>
"Is that so? It’s quite the interesting practice."<br/>
I and Cleria shook our hands for the first time. <br/>
