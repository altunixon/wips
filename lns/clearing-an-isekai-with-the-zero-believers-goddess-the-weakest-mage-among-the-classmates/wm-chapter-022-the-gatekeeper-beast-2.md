<br/>
The Chimera who had its sleeping place flooded seemed to be in a bad mood.<br/>
"Nina-san, I will cast [Surface Walk] on you." (Makoto)<br/>
"No, don’t mind me. I feel like my footing will weaken, so I am okay like this." (Nina)<br/>
"I see." (Makoto)<br/>
So I have worsened the conditions for Nina-san, huh…<br/>
"Takatsuki-sama, I am counting on the support." (Nina)<br/>
"Understood." (Makoto)<br/>
I will do what I can.<br/>
With this much water, the variety of moves I can make increases.<br/>
"Lucy, I am counting on you to chant your magic." (Makoto)<br/>
"Okay. But it might avoid it." (Lucy)<br/>
Lucy doesn’t seem to be too confident.<br/>
"I will hinder it, so go all out." (Makoto)<br/>
"G-Got it!" (Lucy)<br/>
"If it gets dangerous, let’s not push it and return." (Fujiwara)<br/>
Fuji-yan has the return item in hand and tells this to everyone.<br/>
"Then, let’s go!", Nina-san lunges forward.<br/>
This girl really has no hesitation!<br/>
The Chimera seems to be receiving a certain extent of damage from Nina-san’s kicks, it is defending from them.<br/>
It seems to be keeping an eye on Lucy’s magic as well.<br/>
I would be in the third spot.<br/>
It is irritating, but thanks to that, you could say it is lowering its guard against me.<br/>
"Hah!" (Nina)<br/>
Nina-san shoots a kick.<br/>
She is aiming at the goat head.<br/>
Until there it has been the same as before.<br/>
[Water Magic: Mist].<br/>
Dense fog appears around the Chimera.<br/>
But if we were to cover him completely in the fog, we wouldn’t be able to tell the position of the Chimera, so I am covering only a few parts with mist.<br/>
The three heads of the Chimera.<br/>
The goat, lion, and snake heads.<br/>
The 3 heads had no openings because they were watching from three different directions.<br/>
By covering those heads with mist, we can hinder their vision.<br/>
A nice *pang!* sound was made. A clean hit onto the Chimera.<br/>
This time around it topples over. <br/>
"[Fire Magic: Fire Arrow]!" (Lucy)<br/>
Without letting that opening escape, Lucy shoots her spell.<br/>
But this is…<br/>
"The trajectory is wrong…" (Nina)<br/>
Nina-san says dejected.<br/>
Lucy’s spell isn’t heading towards the Chimera.<br/>
The Chimera must have sensed the danger, it hurriedly tried to get up, but seeing that the spell was going to miss, it seemed to be relieved.<br/>
But that’s naive, Chimera.<br/>
[Ice Floor], [Water Current]. <br/>
I freeze the floor around the feet of the Chimera, and then move it with Water Current.<br/>
The Chimera seemed to be panicking from this and tried to stand firm, but it’s too late!<br/>
The thick fire arrow of Lucy hits the Chimera right on the front.<br/>
‘GIIIIEEEEEE!! VUUEEEE!!’ The lion and goat heads screamed as they got covered in the flames.<br/>
"This is our chance." (Nina)<br/>
Nina-san says as she jumped over the Chimera.<br/>
She seems to be chanting.<br/>
"[Earth Magic: Giant Stone]." (Nina)<br/>
Aah, she can also use chant magic, huh.<br/>
A rock several meters big appears at the feet of Nina-san.<br/>
"Shoot!" (Nina)<br/>
And kicks it full force onto the Chimera.<br/>
The giant rock crushes the Chimera.<br/>
‘Guee!’ a painful scream came out from the Chimera, and it collapsed.<br/>
"D-Did we defeat it?" (Lucy)<br/>
"Wait, I will use [Appraisal]." (Fujiwara)<br/>
Lucy and Fuji-yan run towards us.<br/>
"Umu, it is dead. Great job, everyone." (Fujiwara)<br/>
"Nina-san that was Intermediate level Earth Magic, right? You can even use magic like that." (Makoto)<br/>
I thought for sure that she was only a close-range brawler, but she had a secret technique.<br/>
Silver Ranks really are on a different level.<br/>
"No no, it was because of the power of Lucy-sama’s magic, and the support of Takatsuki-sama to make it hit that it was possible." (Nina)<br/>
Nina-san answers with a smile on her face.<br/>
Even though she managed to do the job of vanguard alone against the Chimera and dealt the finishing blow, she is this modest.<br/>
"Well, it is easy-peasy with my magic." (Lucy)<br/>
I want this no-control mage to learn from her.<br/>
"Your magic didn’t hit at all, though?" (Makoto)<br/>
"Ugh." (Lucy)<br/>
"You do miss every 1 out of 2 times." (Makoto)<br/>
"Ah, shut up! It did end in a hit, so it is okay." (Lucy)<br/>
I have a strong feeling of having forced it to hit, but fine, it ended well, so let’s leave it at that.<br/>
"Well then, let’s go!", Fuji-yan is pumped up.<br/>
"If it is a facility from 1,000 years ago, maybe it has strong weapons?" (Makoto)<br/>
Honestly, I am also a bit excited.<br/>
This place gives me the feeling of a hidden dungeon.<br/>
We decide to gather the materials of the Chimera later, and proceed to the door.<br/>
The door is made of thick iron, but it wasn’t locked, so when Nina-san pushed it, it made a heavy sound as it slowly opened.<br/>
◇◇<br/>
 "Looks like a laboratory." (Makoto)<br/>
On the other side of the door, there were old shelves and machines we don’t know what they are for here and there.<br/>
They were all rusted, and were worn-out from weathering.<br/>
The mountain of riches that I was expecting!…that kind of development didn’t happen.<br/>
"What, this is boring~.", Lucy complains.<br/>
"Now now, we might actually get something nice if we dig around. How is it, Goshujin-sama?" (Nina)<br/>
"Hmmm, I gave a cursory glance and I didn’t find anything that could be worth that much." (Fujiwara)<br/>
He is probably using [Appraisal].<br/>
Fuji-yan is looking around.<br/>
Too bad.<br/>
Looks like it was a miss.<br/>
Well, there’s no way something as nice as getting gold and treasures would happen from a dungeon we found by luck.<br/>
"Hey hey, it goes even deeper." (Lucy)<br/>
Lucy who had no interest in the laboratory had gone alone to check deeper.<br/>
"Oi, don’t move alone. It is dangerous." (Makoto)<br/>
"It is okay. We defeated the gatekeeper, so there should be no monsters here." (Lucy)<br/>
"The people that say those kinds of things are the first ones to die, in movies." (Makoto)<br/>
"Movies?" (Lucy)<br/>
I will have to teach Lucy the importance of death flags at a later time.<br/>
"Ooh, it looks like this is the power room of the dungeon." (Nina)<br/>
Seems like Nina-san had gone with Lucy because she was worried about her walking around alone.<br/>
I apologize for our child.<br/>
"Hooh! Power room?! If it is the power source of this artificial dungeon that has been active for 1,000 years, it should be quite the amount of energy." (Fujiwara)<br/>
Fuji-yan shouts in excitement.<br/>
"Goshujin-sama, there’s an incredibly big magic crystal here." (Nina)<br/>
Nina-san reports.<br/>
She is a good duo with Fuji-yan.<br/>
"Fuji-yan, did you find anything worth?" (Makoto)<br/>
By the way, I am walking at the back with [Detection] on.<br/>
I closed the iron door so that monsters can’t enter, and I am checking if there’s any monsters hidden, but right now it doesn’t seem there’s any problems.<br/>
"T-This is incredible! To think a magic crystal this big existed! It is an amount that would be able to cover the whole energy used in Makkaren!" (Fujiwara)<br/>
Looks like we have found something of  worth.<br/>
I should go and check it out too.<br/>
"Wow, I haven’t seen a magic crystal this big even in the elf village. Ah, it prickled me." (Lucy)<br/>
"L-Lucy-sama? It would be best not to touch it carelessly…" (Nina)<br/>
"Hoooh, if we bring this back, Makkaren will be reborn. But how did a gigantic natural magic crystal—waaaaaaaaaah?!" (Fujiwara)<br/>
"Goshujin-sama?!" (Nina)<br/>
"Fujiyan-san! What’s the matter?" (Lucy)<br/>
Eh? <br/>
"Fuji-yan, what happened?! Woah, this is impressive." (Makoto)<br/>
When I entered the room deep inside, there was a magic crystal bigger far bigger than the Chimera, shining in seven colors…moving slowly.<br/>
Why is a crystal moving?<br/>
"We have to run away quickly! We have woken up something unbelievable!" (Fujiwara)<br/>
Fuji-yan is ghastly pale.<br/>
"What’s this, what’s going on?!" (Lucy)<br/>
Lucy is panicking as usual.<br/>
"…" (Nina)<br/>
Nina-san has positioned herself to protect Fuji-yan.<br/>
I also run close to where the 3 are.<br/>
"T-This is bad-desu zo. This is bad-desu zo…" (Fujiwara)<br/>
"Fuji-yan?" (Makoto)<br/>
I spoke to my friend that is muttering over and over.<br/>
The seven colored magic crystal slowly stretches up, and then, it pulsates as it changes form.<br/>
"H-Human?" Lucy says with a trembling voice.<br/>
The seven colored magic crystal changed to a giant humanoid shape.<br/>
The giant eyes look down at us.<br/>
A shining giant that is one size bigger than the Ogre I fought before was looking at us and…smiled.<br/>
Ah…this is a bad pattern.<br/>
