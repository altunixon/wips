Chapter 44 - Preparing for the Journey 1 Part 3<br/>
                                      Translator: SFBaka                                              <br/>
                                      Editor: Thor’s Stone                                              <br/>
After eating lunch at Tally’s Place like usual, we went back to the inn, equipped our armor, and went out to the rocky clearing we’ve been using as practice grounds for a while now.<br/>
Selena and Sharon seemed to want wooden swords for themselves as well, so we went to the shop where Cleria and Elna got their wooden swords and bought a pair for each of them. Perhaps the two of them found wielding wooden swords to be a fresh new experience. The two girls seemed quite happy as they swung their swords around. Girls, we’re still inside the town, so can you please cut that out? That’s dangerous you know.<br/>
“Alan, just how skilled are Selena and Sharon with a sword?” Cleria asked curiously.<br/>
“Well…” I hesitated while thinking about how I should answer.<br/>
“We aren’t really that skilled at all. It’s been a long time since we’ve wielded swords, so we want to brush up on the basics again.” Sharon answered.<br/>
Well, I guess even if I’ve updated their Nanom databases with everything regarding the so-called Corinth-style swordsmanship, I don’t think they’ll be able to use them on my level just like that. Even if it was just in a game, I was still a former world ranker back on my home planet you know.<br/>
“I see… Sharon, can I also participate in your practice sessions later? I also want to practice Corinth-style swordsmanship more. Alan really can’t teach all that well, you see.”<br/>
Hm. Well, the reason I really didn’t want to teach her the details of Corinth-style swordsmanship is that I think the swordsmanship style Cleria’s learned before meeting me is still the more proper one compared to my made-up style.<br/>
“Of course you can, but we’re really going to start from the basics, okay?”<br/>
“That’s what I wish for as well. I’ll be in your care.” Cleria assured her.<br/>
“Well then, let me practice with you all as well. I am also quite interested in Alan’s swordsmanship after all.” Elna followed up.<br/>
It looks like everyone decided to learn Corinth-style swordsmanship together. It’s really embarrassing, so I really want to stop them if I can.<br/>
When we reached the usual training spot, Sharon and the rest began practicing Corinth-style swordsmanship in earnest.<br/>
Sharon began explaining all about Corinth-style swordsmanship’s concept, basic stances, techniques, and steps, while Selena did a live demonstration for reference.<br/>
The basic stances are of course the default ones that were implemented in the game.<br/>
But Sharon’s really great at organizing data huh. Everything’s been categorized neatly. Her explanations were also easy to understand. I found myself listening in before I knew it.<br/>
Since Cleria and Elna have prior experience in swordsmanship, they were able to absorb the basics without much fuss.<br/>
“Next, I’ll explain about the techniques used in Corinth-style swordsmanship called combos.”<br/>
Sharon explained as Selena continued demonstrating the moves. The moves Selena were demonstrating weren’t really part of the so-called Corinth-style swordsmanship, but were instead the basic combos that were implemented in the game.<br/>
After confirming that I can safely leave the swordsmanship practice to Sharon and Selena, I began to practice magic on my own.<br/>
The thing I’m focusing on right now is improving the function of my magic sensor. I received some constructive ideas and improvement suggestions from Iris, so I wanted to quickly test some of them out. Well, the hardware improvements and setting adjustments will be completely left to Nanom, so I really didn’t have to do much myself.<br/>
After a few hours of doing and repeating several experiments, I managed to raise the overall sensitivity of the magic sensor to about thirty percent. Iris’s suggestions all turned out to be really useful.<br/>
It seems the girls have managed to gain quite a bit from today’s swordsmanship practice as well. Eventually, we wrapped up the practice session and returned to the city.<br/>
“Sharon and Selena’s swordsmanship lessons are really good. They are a lot better at teaching than Alan.” Cleria praised.<br/>
“That’s right. I now also have some idea as to what Corinth-style swordsmanship entails.” Elna followed up.<br/>
That’s harsh, you two. Was I really that bad at teaching stuff?<br/>
“Our swordsmanship skills still aren’t there yet, so the more advanced topics and techniques can only be taught by Alan for now,” Sharon explained.<br/>
Ugh. Give me a break, guys.<br/>
It was already dinner time when we got back to the inn. The dishes for dinner were carried out from the kitchen soon after we seated ourselves around a dining table. Tonight’s menu items are tempura and fried trout.  Tartar sauce was also provided as dips for the fried items.<br/>
Hm. So yesterday was tonkatsu and karaage, and tonight is tempura and fried fish huh. All of them were fried dishes, and it felt kinda weird to have just fried dishes in succession. I’ll talk about it with Verse later.<br/>
But even so, delicious food is delicious no matter what. And since word about the inn’s new dishes has been going around lately, it seems a lot of guests were requesting fried dishes or dishes that weren’t familiar to them on an increasingly frequent rate, so I guess it can’t be helped.<br/>
Soon, everyone was immersed in eating and eventually ordered seconds.<br/>
“Fuh. The dishes were really tasty as usual, so I ended up eating a lot again. Now I’ve really been convinced about the high popularity of dishes from Earth back home.” Sharon exclaimed.<br/>
“These dishes are from a region called Earth in Alan’s home country, right?” Cleria asked.<br/>
“That’s right. More specifically, they are cuisines from a region called Japan, located on Earth.”<br/>
“Hou. So Alan is quite well versed in cuisine from that region called Japan, is he?” Cleria inquired further curiously.<br/>
“That’s right. But he isn’t just skilled in Japanese cuisine. It seems he’s knowledgeable about cuisines from all sorts of different regions on Earth.”<br/>
“I see. That makes me look forward to our future meals more and more.”<br/>
After the meal, it was now time to complete my side-job.  I requested help from Sharon and Selena.  The two of them seemed really into it too.<br/>
Our work consisted of drawing magic circle patterns on the papers and applying magic liquid on them. Thanks to the support of the nanoms, we just had to draw the patterns according to the image displayed on the virtual window and fill them out using the magic liquid, so the work should be easy enough.<br/>
After the magic circle images were successfully uploaded to their databases, I explained the basics of drawing magic circles to Sharon and Selena. Both of them started working on the magic circles with the support of their nanom clusters. It looks like there are no problems so far.<br/>
We finished drawing all thirty magic circles after about two hours and managed to successfully complete our work. Man. Having three people working on the job really makes quite a difference.<br/>
The magic wires were already prepared earlier on, so now, the only thing left for me to do is getting the housings and switches from the workshop and putting the components altogether.<br/>
I thanked Selena and Sharon for their help and asked for their assistance again once the other parts were secured. It seems the two were a bit disappointed because the work we did really didn’t seem too, uh, magical in nature. All the vim and vigor they had when we first started was all but gone.<br/>
We’ll begin preparing for our trip tomorrow. I went to the bath and went on for some shut-eye afterward.<br/>
The next morning, we finished off the mountain of sandwiches, which now have become part of the regular menu, and headed straight for Tarus-san’s general store. I guess everyone needs to buy a lot of stuff for the journey.<br/>
We found Jonas-san already waiting for us when we got to the store.   There was a horseless carriage parked in front of the store. It seems they’ve really prepared the stuff we requested for us already.<br/>
“Good morning, Jonas-san.”<br/>
“Good morning,  Alan-san. Good morning to everyone as well.  We’ve already prepared all the things you may need for your journey here.”<br/>
There really were a lot of articles gathered. They were orderly piled on top of a large wooden rack.  There were packages wrapped in large cloth as well. There were food items, glass bottles, and myriad other stuff I wasn’t all that familiar with.<br/>
“As expected, we couldn’t manage to acquire a brand new carriage on such short notice, so we got you a second-hand carriage of good quality instead.”<br/>
Even if Jonas-san described it as second-hand goods, it looked pretty new to me.<br/>
“Even if it’s already used, it looks really good.”<br/>
“That it does. It’s actually one of the two-horse carriages being used by our company. It hasn’t been one year since this one entered service.”<br/>
“That’s great. We’ll take this carriage then. Can you prepare the horses as well?”<br/>
