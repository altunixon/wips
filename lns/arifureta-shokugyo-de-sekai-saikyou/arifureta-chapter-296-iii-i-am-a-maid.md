Arifureta After III   I Am A Maid<br/>
<br/>
「Ahaha, really, I’m sorry for coming at this hour. Furthermore, it seems that I’m being a hindrance to everyone’s work.」<br/>
The one who came to the room looking like he was really sorry while frequently bowing his head was a middle-aged man without any conspicuous traits.<br/>
His attire, like his suit or hairstyle, was well-ordered, and yet, on the whole, he was wrapped in a lax atmosphere that would naturally make the other party feel like letting their guard down.<br/>
「Fukube-san, it must be hard for you. Being outside the jurisdiction of the labor standards act is the harshness of being a public servant.」<br/>
「No no, you are making too much of a big deal for the likes of me. On the contrary, to think that a maid this beautiful will welcome my arrival, it really blows away my fatigue.」<br/>
The man who was smiling while taking glances at Heliotrope who was showing the way was someone from the "returnee response division" who was shouldering the role as a contact person with the "returnees" (basically with Hajime), Fukube Koutarou.<br/>
At a glance, his face gave the impression of a good person, but Hajime and Liliana saw through that and at how deep inside his eyes there was a sharp glint. In contrast with his lax atmosphere, he was a person who couldn’t be underestimated.<br/>
That could be seen from how this man had already continued to shoulder the role of being a contact person with Hajime for more than a year. Being involved with Hajime and co would guarantee anyone to be afflicted with a stomachache, and for this man’s predecessors, being able to stay on the job for three months could be considered as amazing.<br/>
By the way, the "returnee response division" was a new department that was made from many organizations related to the "returnees" by building a cooperative system. The section was under the jurisdiction of the police’s security division after a fashion, but various related departments in the government, like the public security intelligence agency and ministry of foreign affairs and so on, were sending their people to get closely involved and coordinated with each other while making it so that they could respond to situations comprehensively.<br/>
It was a section that was made after the government got involved in this and that in the "returnee uproar" in the past. Various departments made their move, and as a result, all of them received retaliations that were too severe.<br/>
「And, I think that what you want to talk about is the group just now……」<br/>
「Yes, yes. It’s about that matter. My deepest apologies. Our side planned to deal with it before they started trouble, but they moved faster than we imagined. No, this is only an excuse. And, about the details of the situation――」<br/>
Before he started to explain, Hajime raised his hand and stopped him, so Fukube closed his mouth. Cold sweat instantly oozed out from his face. 「Good lord-, is the demon king misunderstanding that it’s the government trying something again!?」 Such thinking came out on his face.<br/>
「I’m not that hasty, so don’t get that pale.」<br/>
「Ha, haha. So it came out on my face? I’m still too green.」<br/>
Fukube wiped the sweat on his forehead with a handkerchief. Then he threw a pill of stomach medicine into his mouth with a practiced motion.<br/>
Hajime smiled wryly at Fukube’s motion that he often witnessed and turned his gaze toward Heliotrope.<br/>
「It seems there is a circumstance regarding that group. Show them the way to the subordinates of Fukube-san who are waiting downstairs. Liliana and I will hear about the circumstances here.」<br/>
「Understood. How about Sumire-sama’s work?」<br/>
「About that. Originally being Kaa-san’s assistant is more important than accompanying some idiot, but……」<br/>
Sumire shook her head left and right *bun bun* repeatedly. A foreign force assaulted with Liliana as their target, and on top of that, an official from public safety came visiting in order to explain the situation. As expected, she didn’t have the nerve to have her way of saying 「The deadline is more important!」.<br/>
「And so, this concerns Liliana, and it seems that Fukube-san has a better grasp of the whole picture of the present situation. We will listen to the circumstances directly. During that time, I’ll leave the work here to you.」<br/>
「Your will. Should I add more personnel, just in case?」<br/>
「I’ll leave it to you.」<br/>
The talk was progressing unhindered. Liliana was murmuring 「Yes yes; my opinion won’t be heard anyway. Far from that, even my question is being ignored. Ahaha~」 with a faraway look.<br/>
「That’s how it is, Sumire-sama.」<br/>
「Ye, yes! What is it, maid-san!?」<br/>
When Sumire was addressed with a respectful attitude, she replied with heightened tension. Looking at her blushing face and nasal breathing that was somewhat rough, it was clear that her inspiration was greatly stimulated. Perhaps her next work would have a combat maid as the main character.<br/>
「While presumptuous, will you allow me to lend you a hand?」<br/>
「But of course! Is what I want to say, but……will you be all right?」<br/>
There was no way a maid from another world would have experience in assistant work for a manga artist.<br/>
Although Sumire loved maids, she was a pro manga artist. Having problems come to the surface because an amateur got involved in the drawing was out of the question. She had to confirm it properly.<br/>
But, Heliotrope was completely unperturbed. She smiled beautifully while responding.<br/>
「Please leave it to me. My lord has made me learn everything in the case of something like this occurring. Please consider me as a battle-ready force.」<br/>
「Geez Hajime, just what is he making a maid of another world learn. I’m happy though!」<br/>
「Also, I have finished reading all of Sumire-sama’s works. Your works are greatly popular even among us the Fleur Knights, all of us are holding deep respect toward Sumire-sama. Therefore, being allowed to help is an honor that is equal to receiving a command from my lord.」<br/>
Heliotrope-san clenched her fist strongly and strongly insisted. Actually, not just the Fleur Knights, even the maids in the palace of Tortus and the young daughters of nobles were also swallowed in an unprecedented shoujo manga boom.<br/>
The selling agency was the South CloudNagumo company. The majority of the direct sales was handled by a cooperating company, Yunker Company.<br/>
Surely, Sumire felt the truth and seriousness from Heliotrope’s sparkling eyes. Sumire’s cheeks blushed in an embarrassed look that was unusual for her. Even in Japan, she was treated as the great Sumire-sensei, but she looked happier with this rather than getting called that by the people in the industry.<br/>
「……Even though she is never helping me out. Hellina you idiot.」<br/>
The former princess muttered something. Surely, she was feeling that the attendant who had been staying by her side since her childhood was taken away. She was completely sulking.<br/>
It was unclear whether that voice was heard or not, but Heliotrope beautifully ignored it and made a finger snap.<br/>
「Salvia.」<br/>
「Yes, captain.」<br/>
The assistants and also Fukube-san twitched when they noticed the number of maids was already increasing from behind Heliotrope!<br/>
It was a lovely maid with dark brown hair worn in a braid that was tied by a scrunchie. Her body was wrapped in a similar Victorian maid outfit like Heliotrope. She was smiling warmly.<br/>
Seeing that girl, the sulking Liliana snapped her eyes open in a flash.<br/>
「I won’t ask anymore how she appeared just now, but please let me say at least this! You are Samiya-san, aren’t you!? The grandchild of the Yunker company’s president Motto! What are you doing in this kind of place!?」<br/>
「I am a maid, Liliana-sama.」<br/>
‘Well of course. That’s a maid uniform she is wearing.’ Sumire and others were of the same opinion inside their heart.<br/>
‘I’m not asking that!’ Liliana was at her wits’ end. Hajime explained it to her straightforwardly.<br/>
「Fleur Knight rank five. She is a commanding officer class who is responsible for managing goods and information. Of course, her combat ability is also without fault.」<br/>
「Why is a merchant’s daughter like thaatt!?」<br/>
「Everything is thanks to the lord discovering me.」<br/>
Actually, Motto Yunker of the Yunker Company, who had a deep relationship with Hajime one way or another, sent this talented person to him because he wanted to secure a connection that was as substantial as possible. To speak without hiding the ulterior motive, 「If possible, I wish that you will accept her as a wife so that I can be related with your majesty the demon king as a relative」, or something like that.<br/>
Naturally, Hajime was also aware of Motto’s merchant soul, and he had also guessed his expectation, so he ignored Salvia’s――real name Samiya Yunker (17 years old) ――approach to him, but……<br/>
When Hajime was working out the plan of the Fleur Knights’ conception, the girl’s name was written in the candidate list Heliotrope made. He tried giving her various trials as a test, and it turned out that she was quite an outstanding talent.<br/>
By the way, Samiya herself didn’t have the perception that she was made a tool for a political marriage. She too was someone who inherited the merchant soul. She sniffed out the scent of money from the demon king’s surroundings and the other world (Earth) and volunteered herself.<br/>
But, after she was selected as a member of the Fleur Knights and received various trials, she went through many twists and turns and reached a point where it was her purpose in life to swear loyalty to the demon king.<br/>
The structure of the Fleur Knights was that those in rank one to ten were commanding officers with their own subordinates, but when looking at how she reached rank five when those positions were mainly grasped by people with combat jobs as their original occupation, it could be seen how astounding her talent was and how far her loyalty went that she would make a great effort with that as her driving force.<br/>
「Well then Sumire-sama. Please allow me and Salvia to be of assistance.」<br/>
「I get it. Well, if Hajime trained you two, then I don’t think I’ll have to worry about your skill. Best regards, okay?」<br/>
Heliotrope and Salvia deeply bowed their heads and said 「Please leave it to us」. After that, they also deeply bowed their heads to the assistants while saying 「Honorable seniors, if there is any mistake in what we are doing, please point it out without mercy」.<br/>
All the assistants together said 「Please take care of us toooo!」 while bowing back with a perfect gesture, for some reason.<br/>
「Fukube-sama.」<br/>
「Oo!? M, me? What is it?」<br/>
Surely, he never thought that he would get addressed. Fukube’s middle-aged uncle face blushed red.<br/>
「I sent a subordinate of mine named Primula to Fukube-san’s subordinates who are waiting outside. She will show the way to the place where the captured people are at. By the lord’s command, we will extract information from them using our methods, but please cooperate with us as much as possible.」<br/>
「Ro, roger. I will contact my subordinates right now.」<br/>
When and how did Heliotrope-san contact her subordinate? Well, she was a maid of the demon king, no~thing would be strange no matter what she did~. Fukube thought that inside his heart while taking out his mobile phone and began contacting his subordinates who came together with him.<br/>
There, Liliana asked somewhat carelessly.<br/>
「……By the way, that person named Primula-san……is she a person who I know as expected?」<br/>
Hajime answered after thinking a bit.<br/>
「You know her. Her real name is Philim Zaara――」<br/>
「Hahah, so this time it’s the little sister of the active captain of the templar knights is iit~」<br/>
Liliana-sama looked somewhat broken. Her friends and acquaintances were transformed into members of a superhuman maid group while she didn’t know.<br/>
Her state resembled Shia in the past somehow. Yes, the Shia at the time when she saw her gentle and kind family that had completely turned into a ‘hyahhaa’ group.<br/>
By the way, the present templar knight-captain was David Zaara, the former captain of Ai-chan’s escort squad.<br/>
The legendary decisive battle was publicly seen as the deed of an evil god who misrepresented himself using the name of Ehito, so the people’s faith toward the church was unchanged. And so, the church was also planned to be rebuilt at the same time as the reconstruction of the capital.<br/>
David and co, the members of the former Ai-chan escort squad, consolidated the knight order of that reborn church. Although, ninety percent of their faith was offered to "our goddess".<br/>
The captain of such reborn templar knight order actually had a little sister. She was a former nun, a magic expert who possessed the vocation of "prayer master" who could display a high ability toward magic in general by praying.<br/>
But, her relationship with her eldest brother was bad, and she was sent to a remote region because she was holding doubt to the way of faith of the church headquarters.<br/>
She also participated in the choir at the legendary decisive battle. There she also fought side by side with David, so the ill feelings between them vanished, and as a church official, she gave a lot of help to Liliana who was striving hard in governmental affairs to restore the kingdom at that time.<br/>
Though it seemed she had changed jobs into a combat maid without Liliana noticing. By the way, her rank was sixth.<br/>
「Aa~, can I interrupt? It seems that my subordinates have joined up with Primula-san, and they are heading to where the group is apprehended. Ahaha, my subordinates who are usually composed are suddenly agitated. A blonde-haired, beautiful maid suddenly knocked on their car window, so they thought they had actually gone crazy.」<br/>
「Well, anyone would doubt their own eyes or head if they saw a blonde-haired maid at midnight.」<br/>
Fukube’s wry smile was also responded by Hajime with a wry smile.<br/>
「Then Fukube-san. Can you tell us the details in the other room?」<br/>
「Yes, allow me to do that. It has become a bit of a troublesome matter, isn’t it? If I have to say my true feelings, there is some aspect where I want to borrow Nagumo-san’s strength. Of course, this is just my personal wish though.」<br/>
The government’s stance was that they absolutely didn’t want the demon king faction to do anything, but it seemed that Fukube himself was thinking 「If that’s the case, then it’s us the people at the scene who will have to take care of this difficult problem! Spare us already! Just how many holes in the stomach will we need to have until you all are satisfied huh!?」.<br/>
Led by Fukube who was casually throwing a stomach medicine pill into his mouth once more, Hajime and Liliana, who was still having a distant gaze, entered into another room.<br/>
–<br/>
–<br/>
–<br/>
To sum up the talk that they had in the other room, it seemed that other than the group that was attacking just now, there were also intelligence operatives or forces from multiple countries sent into Japan.<br/>
Their objective went without saying, the gathering of information on, or removal of, Liliana, the leader of the huge organization that was on the rise all over the world.<br/>
If it was just a leader of a mere company than the story would be different, but when it came to a global organization with an ideal that was like a new religion as its root, then it was understandable for many countries to be apprehensive.<br/>
Although, it was too sudden. It was understandable for the countries to want to take some kind of measure before the network was established as an organization. Be that as it may, the movement of those countries was still too abrupt.<br/>
Regarding that point, according to the explanation that Fukube gave them while oozing cold sweat, it seemed that a higher up of a part of the government messed up.<br/>
Liliana was related with the demon king, and she was a contact person who could talk directly with that demon king; although it was only after a fashion, a friendship could be built from there, and that was why a scheme to gradually make Liliana’s organization belong to Japan was carried out.<br/>
As a result, that movement was grasped by many countries, and they began to move all at once just in case because it would be troubling if the organization really got attached to Japan.<br/>
「Realllyy~~~~, it’s inexcusable!」<br/>
Fukube-san prostrated himself. Recently, he was lamenting that the top of his head was getting desolate, but……so this was the reason.<br/>
Hajime strangely felt pity and respect toward such Fukube and shook his head while smiling wryly.<br/>
「There is a saying ‘danger past and God forgotten’. It’s about time that the pain from the time of the "returnee uproar" got forgotten and some group who thinks "just a bit", "only this much……" came out. I’ve predicted this will happen. As long as Fukube-san and others take care of it within your own organization, then our side doesn’t intend to make a move, so well, please take care of it okay.」<br/>
「Haa, it saves us that you say so. We are already working on a way to deal with it, so please kindly go easy on us.」<br/>
Fukube showed a flagrant look of relief, and he threw a stomach medicine pill into his mouth with a terribly natural motion. His hand’s motion was flowing just like the commercial of Fris○ candies; the pills were thrown directly from its case into his mouth.<br/>
This too was a factor that caused Hajime to feel pity for Fukube strongly. Just how used to swallowing stomach medicine pills was he? And then, how many was he planning on swallowing in a day?<br/>
In exchange of Hajime who was looking at Fukube with really complicated eyes, Liliana was making a caring expression while asking.<br/>
「So, Fukube-san. Have you all predicted how this situation would develop after this? Personally, I expect that it will become a really troublesome situation though……」<br/>
「That prediction is right to the point. From what we have confirmed so far, there are already personnel from three countries who have already entered this country. There are also four countries that are definitely moving. Ideally, all of the countries will work together to gather full and accurate information, so we wish that for the time being it will only be a battle of observation, but……」<br/>
「I’m not going to allow it huh?」<br/>
「Yes, Nagumo-san won’t allow that. However, that means that there will be no information at all about the leader of a growing global organization. An "unknown" is something that is feared the most. Therefore, all of them will be pressed with the choices, whether to resign themselves and accept that fear or to take measures. I believe Hajime-san understands, but……」<br/>
「They surely won’t pick the former choice, unless the fact that they will meet a bitter experience that won’t be worth it from picking the latter choice is carved to the depths of their body. It’s impossible for a country to make that choice.」<br/>
「That’s how it is. Ideally, when an act of removing or kidnapping Liliana-san is going on, other countries will intervene, and they will remove each other, but well, something like ideal is just a word in a book after all.」<br/>
Something like a choice of accepting a life of being monitored didn’t exist for Hajime’s side. And then, even if their side handed over some degree of information about themselves, the next time those organizations would think 「Is this offered information really true?」, and as expected they would come to observe once more.<br/>
And so, in all probability, it would be as Fukube said. At the time the force of each country understood that "observation was completely neutralized", they would surely take a strong measure.<br/>
What was truly terrifying wasn’t the countries that would make such decisions, but the network that was growing in influence and power even now to the degree that the countries couldn’t just ignore it and were forced to make such decisions――in short, it was Liliana’s existence.<br/>
For some reason or another, Hajime and Fukube’s gaze moved toward Liliana. There, Liliana was having a distant look for a different reason from before.<br/>
On her face was written 「Even though I only wanted to help troubled people. Even though it’s basically only relying upon others to make it happen……how did it become like this?」 loud and clear.<br/>
Hajime and Fukube’s gaze turned lukewarm at the same time, and they simultaneously averted their gaze and decided that they didn’t see that.<br/>
「However, this situation, if that is the case, within a few days, these groups will gather in large numbers around us huh?」<br/>
「……Originally, we wanted to deal with everything before it turned out like that, but……I’m sorry. The demon king section’s――cough-, my apologies. Even for the returnee response division, honestly, we are in a situation where we don’t have enough time and personnel.」<br/>
「Oi, just now, did you say demon king division? Could it be, that’s the nickname on your side?」<br/>
「Diplomatic response is also starting already, but it will be better to not expect anything from it. From our view, we wish to avoid gunshots in the middle of the city, and we also wish to evacuate Liliana-san to a place with few people by all means in preparation for unforeseen situations. That is our suggestion, or rather, our true feelings.」<br/>
Fukube beautifully ignored Hajime’s question and gave a suggestion with an apologetic look.<br/>
Hajime was making an awfully displeased look, but it wasn’t because of Fukube’s suggestion, rather it was surely because of the response division’s nickname that Fukube leaked out.<br/>
National Police Agency Security Department Demon King Division……. Certainly, such a police institution was disagreeable.<br/>
「I don’t mind that. If I remember correctly, I shouldn’t have anything scheduled that cannot be rearranged. After all, I’m worried about a skirmish occurring in a place that is outside of our perception.」<br/>
「I guess. It’s also troublesome if they are loitering around sporadically. Gathering them in one place and taking care of them in one go will also give off a better impression to those countries.」<br/>
「Then, allow me to continue the talk in that direction. About the place, we prepared several hideouts for the sake of witness protection, so perhaps it will be better to use those.」<br/>
「As expected from Fukube-san. You work fast.」<br/>
After hearing Hajime’s praise, for the first time this day Fukube showed a relieved smile that wasn’t a forced smile, wry smile or convulsing smile.<br/>
After that, when they finished hammering out the details, the subordinates of Fukube who came together with Primula shared the information of the background, objective, the plan forward, and so on of the attackers who came.<br/>
It seemed that the information had been thoroughly extracted, and they didn’t ask as far as the method used, but when looking at the gaze of terror that Fukube’s subordinates directed toward Primula……it must be something that shouldn’t be asked.<br/>
Primula, although formerly, was a gentle and kind sister though……<br/>
「Hajime-san……you are endeavoring to act prudently on Earth, but in exchange, aren’t you cutting too loose on Tortus?」<br/>
「……」<br/>
Liliana was looking alternately at Hajime and Primula with sad eyes. For some reason, Hajime was at a loss for words and averted his gaze in response.<br/>
By the way, Heliotrope and Salvia were finishing their assistant work perfectly.<br/>
They didn’t borrow the work tools, but instead they had prepared them beforehand; furthermore, they took them out from inside their sleeves *shakin!*, or took them out from their breast or inside their skirt, so Sumire and co were able to have fun working while getting heated up from start to end.<br/>
Not forgetting to improve the work place’s atmosphere too, they really were perfect maids.<br/>
–<br/>
–<br/>
–<br/>
The next day.<br/>
There the figures of the Nagumo family were in a splendid lodging deep inside the mountain of a certain prefecture.<br/>
It was a mountain forest with an abundance of nature in the surroundings, and a refreshing river was streaming nearby.<br/>
It was a hideout for the protection target that Fukube prepared. It was separated enough from human habitation, and even if some commotion occurred, there would be no one who noticed.<br/>
The autumn colors of the mountain still remained. It could also function as a refuge in the meaning of a holiday place or health resort.<br/>
This might be a consideration from Fukube in his own way toward the Nagumo family who had to deal with a dangerous situation in this season when autumn was over.<br/>
Furthermore, not just Sumire and Shuu, currently even Remia and Tio were also busy people, but everyone emptied their schedules even if they had to force it and came here. Their family was being targeted. So this was only natural.<br/>
Hajime came out of the lodging and looked around the surrounding. Even the beautiful forest landscape that still had red leaves remaining would undoubtedly make a complete change in expression when night came. Thinking about when the people targeting Liliana would come, the forest at night would be a suitable cover for them. The darkness would become terribly frightening for the side who would be attacked.<br/>
But, Hajime made a fearless grin while staring at such a forest.<br/>
And then――he declared.<br/>
「Now then――let’s barbeque~~~!」<br/>
「「「「「「「「「「OO~~~~~~-!」」」」」」」」」」<br/>
The Nagumo family responded in excitement. They all showed wide smiles on their faces, with a lot of ingredients in their hands!<br/>
「Papa! Quiiick! Quiiick! Myuu’s stomach is crying nano!」<br/>
「My my, Myuu. To be so happy……」<br/>
「Right, it was a bit forced, but it’s good that we hath emptied our schedules for this last family trip of the autumn.」<br/>
「……Nn. This year everyone is busy, we weren’t really able to go on a family trip.」<br/>
「Yue wasn’t really busy though.」<br/>
「……Kaori. It will become a scuffle again if you say that. Aa, look, Yue is taking a fighting pose already! Oi, you! Kaori too, don’t take a stance with that green onion!」<br/>
Even with Shizuku’s intermediation, Yue and Kaori were starting a quarrel using vegetables as weapons. Myuu was lifting a lump of A5 rank meat above her head while making merry 「Meaat, meat!」 in high spirits. Remia and Tio were watching her with similar smiles.<br/>
Shia was smiling wryly at such a scene while devoting herself to preparing the other ingredients promptly; beside her, Liliana was helping.<br/>
「Ahaha……well, the incident this time became a good chance. Especially because Lily-san is extraordinarily busy, she cannot really spend time with us. We owe the attackers one! Ah, come to think of it Myuu-chan. Do you want to go looking for fish in the river later? Let’s fire at the fish using finger bullet♪」<br/>
「Shia-san, please fish normally! Don’t make the river be dyed crimson!」<br/>
The wive~s were clamoring ‘kyaa kyaa’ with high spirits.<br/>
……It seemed they didn’t empty their schedules because they were worried about Liliana, but they purely wanted to go on a family trip, that was all.<br/>
「……Ee~rr, then I will stand by in the operation headquarters, so……」<br/>
Fukube actually accompanied them as a guide, but seeing the people of the Nagumo family enjoying the holiday normally without looking burdened or feeling in danger at all, he emitted a sorrowful air thinking 「Well, it’s the usual thing」 while going back. Tonight too……it would be cup ramen for him. ‘Let’s have Ra○’, he muttered inside his heart while glancing longingly at the lump of A5 rank meat. (TN: Raoh cup ramen, seems to be popular in Japan.)<br/>
「Oh, Fukube-san. Are you going back already? If you like, please eat together with us.」<br/>
「That’s right. If you don’t eat properly and get some nutrition, the top of your head will rapidly get desolate you know?」<br/>
Warm (?) words from Shuu and Sumire!<br/>
Fukube turned around in a flash, and his gaze turned toward Hajime. His eyes were just like a puppy that was seeking permission from its owner after getting told 「Wait!」 in front of its meal!<br/>
Inside his heart Hajime thought 「This person, at his root he is someone that you really cannot let your guard down against, but why is he sometimes giving an impression like a comedian or dog like this huh」 with a wry smile.<br/>
「You see, Nagumo-san. That’s because I’m a dog of the nation.」<br/>
「……Really, even though you are someone that one must not let their guard down against.」<br/>
The wry smile of Hajime’s whose mind was normally seen through was deepening while nodding to convey 「Okay!」.<br/>
Fukube happily rushed toward the barbeque saying 「I’ll take care of the charcoal management~」. Next, he said 「Ah, I also want to bring back some for my subordinates, so can I pack up some?」 trying to secure a lot of meat casually.<br/>
In the corner of his sight, Hajime caught Fukube eating Myuu’s throwing technique when his hand reached toward the meat 「What are you going to do with Myuu’s meat nano――!」 and got thrown away. He gave a sidelong glance at that while enjoying the autumn mountain’s scenery to his heart’s content.<br/>
