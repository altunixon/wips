<br/>
"Dragon…" (Lucy)<br/>
The mutter of Lucy passed by my ears.<br/>
Rugged stone-like scales.<br/>
Its whole body a dark brown with a tint of green like emerald. <br/>
This must be an Earth Dragon.<br/>
That mouth that has giant fangs feel like they could swallow everything.<br/>
It had plenty enough pressure to be called the king of monsters.<br/>
The moment I saw that, what I felt was elation. <br/>
"Wow…" (Makoto)<br/>
A dragon is here.<br/>
That dragon.<br/>
A shock that surpasses my coming to this parallel world ran through my whole body.<br/>
Aah, Isekais really are incredible…<br/>
I was probably watching in admiration for only around 2-3 seconds.<br/>
"Makoto!" (Lucy)<br/>
(Get a hold of yourself, Makoto!) (Noah)<br/>
The scream of Lucy and the rebuke of the Goddess overlapped.<br/>
I regain my senses. <br/>
The adventurers who also regained their senses raised screams and began to run away.<br/>
Face the Dragon<br/>
Escape from the Dragon ←<br/>
I let out a smile at the options RPG Player gave me.<br/>
(Don’t ask for the impossible, man.) (Makoto)<br/>
Without hesitation, I hugged Lucy tightly and jumped off the waterfall.<br/>
"EEEEEEEEEEEEHHHHHHH?!" (Lucy)<br/>
We were swallowed inside the waterfall while listening to the screams of Lucy.<br/>
While we were swallowed by the violent water stream, I controlled the water in order to absorb the impact.<br/>
[Water Magic: Water Current].<br/>
The moment we crashed into the basin of the waterfall, I mitigated the impact into a soft hit.<br/>
The inside of the lake is deep, and we didn’t get slammed into the ground.<br/>
We advance through the water just like that.<br/>
It is dark inside the lake so I couldn’t see anything, but with [Night Vision] and [Detection], I search for monsters.<br/>
(There’s a lot of monsters.) (Makoto)<br/>
As expected of the Mid Floor.<br/>
Just a quick look with Detection, I could tell that there’s quite a lot of monsters.<br/>
(Let’s get out from the lake first.) (Makoto)<br/>
Lucy who I have in my arms is going *glub glub*, but I ignore her for now and return to the shore. <br/>
◇◇<br/>
We got out to the shore, and hid ourselves in the shadow of a big rock.<br/>
Thanks to Stealth, monsters haven’t noticed us.<br/>
"Hey! I heard nothing about suddenly jumping down!" (Lucy)<br/>
"If I did tell you, those guys would know about it too. Or more like, are those guys okay?" (Makoto)<br/>
"Why are you worrying about them when you were about to be killed by them… In the first place, why did a dragon show up at a place like that?" (Lucy)<br/>
"Lucas-san told me that dragons are in the Lower Floor, so we should not go at any cost…" (Makoto)<br/>
"A dragon at the Upper Floor is unfair." (Lucy)<br/>
"Right." (Makoto)<br/>
We sighed.<br/>
"What should we do from now on?" (Makoto)<br/>
"We return to the Upper Floor, right?" (Lucy)<br/>
"Yeah, but we don’t know the path to return there." (Makoto)<br/>
"Eh? Isn’t it okay to just return through the waterfall? With your magic." (Lucy)<br/>
"I can’t go as far as climbing a waterfall…" (Makoto)<br/>
It took me my all just to mitigate the fall from the waterfall so that we won’t get injured.<br/>
"Could it be that we are in a disastrous situation?" (Lucy)<br/>
"It might be a bit of a bad situation, yeah. But first, let’s dry our clothes." (Makoto)<br/>
I cast the evaporation magic on Lucy and I.<br/>
If our bodies get cold, our movements dull, and our stamina gets sapped out.<br/>
The food we have on hand will only last for around 2 days, huh.<br/>
I wasn’t planning on doing an expedition, so I didn’t bring much.<br/>
"Let’s search for a path that can lead us up." (Makoto)<br/>
"Even if you say that, the waterfall is going as far as my eye can see, you know." (Lucy)<br/>
"There’s parts here and there where the waterfall is divided, so let’s investigate while avoiding monsters." (Makoto)<br/>
But no matter how far we go, we could only see cliffs and waterfalls.<br/>
Half a day has already passed.<br/>
The reason why it doesn’t feel so despairing is…<br/>
"Aah, it is quite the breathtaking sight." (Makoto)<br/>
Most likely thanks to this superb view.<br/>
"You know…" (Lucy)<br/>
Lucy says with a voice of amazement.<br/>
"This is something I thought at that time with the dragon as well but, you are a bit weird, Makoto." (Lucy)<br/>
"Really?" (Makoto)<br/>
"Yeah. Do you like dangerous things?" (Lucy)<br/>
Hmm, that’s…I am beginning to feel like I can’t deny that.<br/>
"You seem to be looking around restlessly and having fun even in a dungeon. You had your eyes glittering when facing that dragon from before." (Lucy)<br/>
"…I am sorry for that time." (Makoto)<br/>
"Also, in your world, there were a lot of rides that can fly in the sky, right? I heard about that from Fujiyan-san, you know. And yet, why were you so giddy with the Flying Ship?" (Lucy)<br/>
"That can’t be helped." (Makoto)<br/>
You wouldn’t get it. **<br/>
The airplanes from my previous world, and the Flying Ships of this world are completely different.<br/>
In a fantasy world, flying rides are important.<br/>
"I don’t get it." (Lucy)<br/>
She emphasized, but couldn’t manage to empathize, huh.<br/>
Well, I am an otherworldler.<br/>
While we were having harmless talk like that, we continued exploring.<br/>
But we couldn’t find a path to go to the Upper Floor at all.<br/>
◇◇<br/>
We got a bit tired, so we were taking a rest. At the time we were doing that, we met her.<br/>
"U-Uhm…are you adventurers?" <br/>
We were suddenly spoken to.<br/>
We are in a space at the back of a waterfall in this underground area, and Lucy and I were sleeping in shifts.<br/>
It was at the time when we were thinking about resuming our exploration.<br/>
"Hm?" (Lucy)<br/>
"…"<br/>
I also turn around.<br/>
The one who spoke to us was a girl.<br/>
But she had quite the beautiful face.<br/>
Her clothes were in tatters, holes here and there, and her shoulders were exposed.<br/>
It looks like she had a bad time.<br/>
"Please help me… I will do anything you want to repay you…" <br/>
That girl asks for our help with a feeble voice.<br/>
