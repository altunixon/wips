15-Intermission 2. At the Eastern End of the Continent (1)<br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
※ This isn't from Satou's POV<br/>
<br/>
"....Furry mountain?"<br/>
<br/>
I muttered as I saw a small mountain of fur in my dim view.<br/>
<br/>
--Thud.<br/>
<br/>
A warm lump touched my body.<br/>
<br/>
When I look down, I see a creature resembling a newborn rat.<br/>
It might be cute if it were small, but it's as frighteningly big as an adult man.<br/>
<br/>
I almost reflexively jumped out, but I couldn't put any power in my limbs, I was only able to bend backward.<br/>
<br/>
"●●●"<br/>
<br/>
I heard gibberish words from the small mountain.<br/>
<br/>
Apparently the owner of that fur is alive.<br/>
I wonder if I've been carried here to be his food--.<br/>
<br/>
Right when I thought of that, I noticed.<br/>
<br/>
"So this is reincarnation..."<br/>
<br/>
I had never thought that I would be thrust down in the animal realm.<br/>
<br/>
I couldn't fight again the rapid drowsiness of my body as I fell asleep just like that.<br/>
<br/>
And then I recall my shitty past in my dream--.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
◇◇◇◆◇◆◆◆<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
"Mom, I'm  hungry."<br/>
"I'm sorry, we have no money, so get some meal from our neighbor okay."<br/>
"Eeh, again?"<br/>
<br/>
Hearing my mom's and elder sister's conversation in the corridor, I realized that mom had offered all the food to [God].<br/>
Since dad disappeared with a young girl, mom was always absorbed into [God].<br/>
<br/>
"Tarou, let's go."<br/>
"Un."<br/>
<br/>
Together with my elder sister, we went to the neighboring diner.<br/>
Of course nowadays there's no one kind enough to feed us free of charge.<br/>
<br/>
We were finally able to eat after I washed plates while enduring the cold water while my sister acted like a waitress.<br/>
It was not that good, but I didn't care as long as it made me full.<br/>
<br/>
One day my sister ran away from home after she graduated middle school.<br/>
I was always a baggage of my sister....<br/>
<br/>
I survived somehow while enduring hunger.<br/>
I'm sure I would've long been dead if there was no lunch service in my middle school.<br/>
<br/>
After graduating middle school, I was picked up by a small factory in the town, I left my mother who offered everything to god as I began to live alone.<br/>
The wage is low, but I was satisfied with living a life where I could have meals three times a day.<br/>
<br/>
Cause I wanted to be apart from my mother who raised queer cry at night and endlessly repeated her god's teaching, no matter what.<br/>
After living alone, I noticed that my heart had also started to fall ill.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
After some time, when I (boku) started to call myself with ore (I), I met an unexpected person.<br/>
<br/>
"Is that you Tarou?"<br/>
"Dad?"<br/>
<br/>
The dad that I hadn't met for more 10 years was wearing priest-like clothes.<br/>
<br/>
"What are you doing now?"<br/>
"I'm an instructor of the Eastern Joy School."<br/>
<br/>
--Ha?<br/>
<br/>
Don't tell me that even dad had been influenced by some good-for-nothing cult?<br/>
<br/>
"Tarou, won't you go with me?"<br/>
"I'm not interested in cult."<br/>
<br/>
I shook off the arm of my father who started to be delirious and spat out.<br/>
<br/>
--I don't wanna have anything to do with cult and god!<br/>
<br/>
"This is different! Don't group up the Eastern Joy School with the average cult! This is a school dedicated to finding happiness for people!"<br/>
<br/>
That's the same thing, dad.<br/>
<br/>
"You have a job right? Would you like to join the Eastern Joy School?"<br/>
<br/>
My dad said that after seeing my factory uniform.<br/>
His eyes, mixed with flattery and contempt, were unpleasant.<br/>
<br/>
"I've no interest."<br/>
"Then why don't you try investing in the school's benefit society? 100,000 no, just 10,000 yen is fine! This month's quota is tight you see. Please."<br/>
<br/>
I felt sick looking at my father acting like the model of shamelessness.<br/>
I lightly pushed him aside and ran away.<br/>
<br/>
Even though I noticed that the pay envelope in my pocket fell, I ran through the alley without stopping.<br/>
I almost vomited hearing my father saying, "Thanks, Tarou" behind.<br/>
<br/>
"God can go die!"<br/>
<br/>
I frantically shouted out the sordid feeling overflowing in my heart.<br/>
I felt like I'd get swallowed by that sordid feeling if I didn't do that.<br/>
<br/>
I kept running while staring at the sky.<br/>
<br/>
"Oy! Look out!"<br/>
<br/>
Before I could see who said that, I heard a high-pitched noise of a brake, and got hit by an impact, my sight was wrapped in darkness.<br/>
Truck guy, sorry for jumping in front of ya....<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
◆<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
"....God?"<br/>
<br/>
I faced a self-proclaimed god in a purple space.<br/>
<br/>
The self-proclaimed god told me that they'd reincarnate me to another world.<br/>
Moreover, they'd give me a special power that only I could use called Unique Skills.<br/>
<br/>
--Too suspicious.<br/>
<br/>
"I don't have money."<br/>
<br/>
The self-proclaimed god replied with something with 'denial' and 'unnecessary' as the points.<br/>
<br/>
Apparently, it's hard to communicate with this guy.<br/>
It feels like having a conversation between extreme ends in the factory.<br/>
<br/>
"Like I said, I don't need no power! More importantly, let me hit you."<br/>
<br/>
I don't mind if my soul is erased here if I could hit god who had wrecked my life.<br/>
<br/>
And then a purple sphere emerged in front of me.<br/>
I didn't know if that was a god or not, but I hit it with all my might while thinking of my shitty father and cult mother.<br/>
<br/>
It felt like hitting a water surface and then my right arm got sunk into the sphere until my shoulder.<br/>
<br/>
"Uwaa"<br/>
<br/>
I pulled my arm in panic, but two lights were coiling about around it.<br/>
<br/>
"Chose? Chose what?"<br/>
<br/>
I asked the self-proclaimed god, but the other party didn't reply, instead an image got unilaterally transmitted to me.<br/>
<br/>
"Gods? There's other gods? Hit them all I want if I meet them?"<br/>
<br/>
I tried to grasp the purple lights and then I felt my body got filled with power.<br/>
It seems I acquired two power, [Lucky Star] and [<<Reflect Unlucky>>].<br/>
<br/>
"If this power allow me to hit gods, then I'll accept it."<br/>
<br/>
I grinned at the image transmitted by the self-proclaimed god.<br/>
<br/>
"I'll beat you the last as a thank."<br/>
<br/>
The self-proclaimed god replied like it was nothing, annoying me.<br/>
<br/>
"You're looking forward to it? I'll make you eat those words someday."<br/>
<br/>
I was melting inside the purple darkness as I heard the laughter of the self-proclaimed god who heard my declaration of war.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
◆◆◆◇◆◇◇◇<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
"Sheesh, is this primitive age...."<br/>
<br/>
I muttered while looking at the people living in pit-dwellings.<br/>
<br/>
I thought I was dropped into the animal realm when I just got reincarnated, but it turned out that I'd just been reincarnated as one of beastkin races, the weaselkin.<br/>
<br/>
My father in this life seems to be the patriarch of this poor hunting community at the eastern end.<br/>
<br/>
After losing to the powerful tigerkin and lizardkin, we were driven away to the barren land near the coast which had few prey, a lot of people died of starvation during winter.<br/>
I wanted to discard this unstable hunting lifestyle and pressed forward with agriculture, but the land here is really bad it's impossible.<br/>
It seemed my father tried to procure sea products, but he gave up after 30% of our tribe were eaten by the monsters living in the sea.<br/>
<br/>
I spent many days without food, but strangely enough, there were many times where I got food myself before I died of starvation.<br/>
Gods and cults are still my enemy even now, but I don't mind thanking that self-proclaimed god for the [Lucky Star] I got.<br/>
<br/>
"Ani-cha"<br/>
"Ou, are you alright going out today?"<br/>
"Aye!"<br/>
<br/>
I support my youngest weak little sister walking.<br/>
I dunno if it's because my father is fertile or if it's just the tribe thing, but I have a lot of siblings in this life.<br/>
<br/>
"You look like a princess today."<br/>
<br/>
She usually wore some dirty crude clothing, but today she's wearing something that looks like a traditional costume.<br/>
<br/>
"Ehehee, it's a ritual."<br/>
"Ritual? Ritual huh--"<br/>
<br/>
I felt a foreboding at the [Ritual] my little sister told me.<br/>
<br/>
And that foreboding became real immediately.<br/>
<br/>
"S-STOOOOOOOOP!"<br/>
"Tarou, don't obstruct the ritual!"<br/>
"Yes! That good-for-nothing sick is finally good for something."<br/>
<br/>
My father and my eldest brother sneered at me for trying to stop them.<br/>
Even though I tried to forcibly shake them off, this child's body couldn't make it happen.<br/>
<br/>
I could hear shrill laughter of my little sister.<br/>
<br/>
"Look, she's having fun right."<br/>
"That happy medicine is exclusive for the offering after all."<br/>
"That's just a drug!"<br/>
<br/>
The moment I snapped, my little sister's laughter stopped, and I heard shouts of joy from the tribe people overlooking the ritual.<br/>
My heart froze looking at the lump of flesh that was my little sister.<br/>
<br/>
"You should thank her. If he didn't become the god's sacrifice, the corpse over there would have been you, the 『Taboo Child』, instead--"<br/>
<br/>
My eldest brother told me that while laughing repulsively.<br/>
<br/>
"--You sure are lucky."<br/>
<br/>
Hearing that, I lost control of myself and hit my eldest brother while screaming.<br/>
Of course, a seven year old like me couldn't possibly win against my eldest brother, I laid on the ground after getting beat up.<br/>
<br/>
--I want power.<br/>
<br/>
Not the vague lucky power I got from the self-proclaimed god, but a power to have my way with....<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
◇◇◇◇<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
"Nii-san, I should go with you after all."<br/>
"Al, there's no need for you to pull the short end of the stick too y'know?"<br/>
<br/>
The brightest one among my siblings, Alrusuri came before me in traveling clothes.<br/>
<br/>
My eldest brother drove me out of the tribe once he took over as the patriarch, perhaps it was because he didn't like me kept pressing the agriculture.<br/>
<br/>
"They say you're going abroad to study about agriculture but--"<br/>
"I know."<br/>
<br/>
--In reality, it's an exile.<br/>
<br/>
"Besides, my dream is the same as Nii-san's, that is having agriculture as our tribe's mean of survival."<br/>
"I see."<br/>
<br/>
I left the familiar pit dwelling village with Al and two guards.<br/>
A tinge of loneliness recurred in my chest when I could not see the village anymore.<br/>
Looks like I'm attached to it even though it's a poor village.<br/>
<br/>
"Where are we going?"<br/>
"I heard from father who went traveling in the past--"<br/>
<br/>
We know little about outside world as there's no peddler who comes to our village.<br/>
<br/>
According to father, our race is a nomadic people who peddle around the world.<br/>
It seems there's extremely few who settle down like this village.<br/>
<br/>
"If tigerkin or lizardkin people found us, we'd probably be killed or become slaves. So we need to head toward the humankin country while avoiding their regions."<br/>
<br/>
According to father who was once a traveler, we should be able to reach either Rumooku Kingdom or Doraoku Kingdom.<br/>
<br/>
We hid ourselves from huge monsters and tigerkin's assaults, ran away with all our might from the slow lizardkin, and finally arrived at a human settlement with our emaciated bodies.<br/>
<br/>
While feeling nostalgic at humans living at the village, I was thrust before the reality; beastfolks like us are persecuted.<br/>
We helped the farmwork in that village while getting treated like slaves as we learned their language.<br/>
It was the long-awaited agriculture, but the things the village was doing was just a primitive farmwork where they plowed, randomly sowed seeds, and scattered fertilizers without even ridging the field.<br/>
<br/>
We ran away from the village once we learned how to talk imperfectly, heading toward the western big kingdom, Shiga Kingdom.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
◇<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
"Nii-san, there's a village."<br/>
"Yeah, the field looks splendid."<br/>
<br/>
Going out of our way to Shiga Kingdom looks to be the correct choice.<br/>
We rode our horses to Puta Town along the highway since the field belonged exclusively to villages.<br/>
<br/>
"Young master, the town seems strange."<br/>
"Yea, it seems you're right."<br/>
<br/>
The guards didn't need to stop us.<br/>
We could hear tumult from the people inside the town.<br/>
<br/>
There must be trouble.<br/>
<br/>
"Let's avoid this town and go to the next one."<br/>
<br/>
I turned the horse around as I said that.<br/>
<br/>
"Nii-san, that!"<br/>
<br/>
Hearing my little brother, I turned back and saw a foxkin girl with purple fur who tumbled out of the town gate.<br/>
And she's bloody all over....<br/>
<br/>
"Nii-san!"<br/>
<br/>
I heard my little brother's worried voice far in the back.<br/>
Apparently, I'd run the horse without thinking of the consequences.<br/>
<br/>
"Gimme your hand!"<br/>
『Ui? Mofumofu?』<br/>
<br/>
--Japanese language?<br/>
<br/>
I pick up the young foxkin girl, passing through the townspeople who carry crude weapons such as farm tools.<br/>
<br/>
"There's more of those cursed beasts!"<br/>
"Kill the No Life King's kin!"<br/>
<br/>
Ignoring the mob-like townspeople's shouts, I run the horse.<br/>
<br/>
"Nii-san, they're chasing us."<br/>
<br/>
Three armed men are pursuing us.<br/>
<br/>
"Young master, please leave this to us."<br/>
"No you can't. I'd rather dump this girl than you guys."<br/>
<br/>
The body of the young foxkin girl on the back seat stiffened hearing me rejecting the guards' reckless suggestion.<br/>
<br/>
"Nii-san!"<br/>
<br/>
I turned my line of sight back to the front at my little brother's shout, a ratkin riding a six-legged boar jumped out of the forest.<br/>
<br/>
"I ask! Are you criminals?!"<br/>
"We're not, we just saved a girl who was about to be killed by adventurers."<br/>
"Understood. With justice in hands, Warrior Mize of Ash Ratkin will assist you!"<br/>
<br/>
That ratkin was strong.<br/>
To think a level 30 warrior was this strong!<br/>
<br/>
Warrior Mize defeated the pursuers in no time at all and we got out of the trouble.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
◇<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
"Thank you. I'm Tarou of weaselkin. I came to Shiga Kingdom to learn about agriculture."<br/>
"Hou? That's unusual for a beastkin."<br/>
<br/>
Warrior Mize was surprised after my introduction, and then he folded his arms while looking a bit troubled.<br/>
<br/>
"Is it that unusual?"<br/>
"Sorry, it's not about that."<br/>
<br/>
I urge the hesitant Warrior Mize to continue.<br/>
<br/>
"Presently, Shiga Kingdom is in a dangerous state due to the murder of a noble by the 『No Life King』."<br/>
<br/>
The town earlier certainly looked strange.<br/>
<br/>
"Umu, and?"<br/>
"That 『No Life King』 is a Cursed Child--In other world, he has the same purple fur as you and that girl over there."<br/>
"In other words, we cannot enter Shiga Kingdom?"<br/>
<br/>
I exchanged looks of loss with my little brothers and the guards at the outrageous situation.<br/>
<br/>
We must have looked really pitiful.<br/>
<br/>
"This must be fate. If it's fine with you, would you like to go with me?"<br/>
<br/>
Warrior Mize told us that.<br/>
We don't really mind as long as we can learn about agriculture--.<br/>
<br/>
"To where?"<br/>
"Elf Village, Boruenan Forest."<br/>
<br/>
Thus, our destination changed from Shiga Kingdom to Boruenan Forest.<br/>
