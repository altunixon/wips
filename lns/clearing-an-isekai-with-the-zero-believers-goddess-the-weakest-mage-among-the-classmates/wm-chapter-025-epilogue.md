<br/>
Parting with the mortals, he moves within the earth veins.<br/>
It is freedom he has gotten after 15,000,000 years.<br/>
It feels good.<br/>
He comes out slowly from the ground.<br/>
This is somewhere west of the continent.<br/>
Endless lush forests spread out. <br/>
But…<br/>
"…I don’t like it." <br/>
The Spirits were acting as if they were hiding themselves and don’t have energy.<br/>
This would be unthinkable in the times when we Titans strided on the surface.<br/>
Instead, I feel the presence of those guys looking down from the heavens.<br/>
I did hear about this from the Spirits, but the current mortal plane has changed.<br/>
(How truly annoying.) (Noah)<br/>
"…Noah-ojousama." <br/>
The youngest child of the Titan Gods that we serve.<br/>
The other Titan Gods have been confined by them and the only one pitifully left in the mortal plane is her.<br/>
(Can you please not call me pitiful?) (Noah)<br/>
Oh, sorry for the rudeness.<br/>
"…This time around, I managed to awaken from a long seal… But it was really convenient that someone with the eye to see through the God’s seal appeared." <br/>
It shouldn’t be something a normal human can see through.<br/>
That place was also under a spell that made it hard to find.<br/>
(There’s no way something so convenient exists. I was the one who called him. I gave that merchant-kun Divine Power temporarily through my dagger. The effect is already gone though.) (Noah)<br/>
Ooh, is that so.<br/>
But I don’t think he is your believer though, Noah-sama.<br/>
Was it the believer Makoto?<br/>
Wouldn’t that boy suffice?<br/>
(It wouldn’t. He doesn’t have any decent skills.) (Noah)<br/>
You really say some harsh things.<br/>
Isn’t he your only believer?<br/>
He was set on saving you, Noah-sama.<br/>
(Right. But did you see that boy’s mana? He runs out of mana after 1-2 elementary grade spells, you know? I gave him the Spirit User skill, but it doesn’t seem like he can master it at all.) (Noah)<br/>
(Moreover, that boy is weak, and yet, he charges right into strong enemies, you know?!  I can’t stand watching that!) (Noah)<br/>
She is mad.<br/>
It is rare for Noah-ojousama to complain about the actions of a believer.<br/>
Titan Gods are Gods that love freedom.<br/>
The Gods themselves, and their believers too.<br/>
The current rulers of the God Realm seem to love supervising things, they are forcing their believers to pray, is what I have heard. <br/>
I hope Noah-sama hasn’t been affected negatively by their practices.<br/>
(I have not been influenced by them.) (Noah)<br/>
I wonder.<br/>
I can’t say I condone pushing a pure boy like that.<br/>
I heard that 1,000 years ago, you used a believer of yours and brought chaos to the world, Noah-ojousama.<br/>
It didn’t go well though.<br/>
(…I am surprised you know that.) (Noah)<br/>
I may have been under the petrification seal, but I was listening to the Spirits regarding the movements of the world after all.<br/>
It seems like the only Titan God, Noah-sama, has been doing her best. <br/>
It hasn’t shown much results though.<br/>
(I failed 1,000 years ago. But I will be careful this time around. I will have the Olympus shits cry and beg.) (Noah)<br/>
I can see the dark shadow of vengeance in that voice of yours.<br/>
To think you could bring out such a voice filled with hatred.<br/>
That cute Noah-ojousama seems to have been warped.<br/>
(Hmph, I am cute even now.) (Noah)<br/>
Must be, must be.<br/>
Noah-ojousama was believed to be the number one beauty within the Titan Gods.<br/>
Seeing that appearance of yours, mortals, animals, and even demons would be charmed by you.<br/>
At the time when that boy was going to become your believer, he must have seen your appearance and couldn’t maintain his sanity.<br/>
He has probably been charmed to the point that he can only think about you, Noah-ojousama.<br/>
(…Right.) (Noah)<br/>
"…What’s the matter, Noah-ojousama?" <br/>
(It’s nothing. By the way, what will you be doing now, old man?) (Noah)<br/>
I plan on going around the world searching for our sealed comrades.<br/>
(Yeah, that sounds good. Even if we were to wage war on the Olympus, we need numbers!) (Noah)<br/>
So you really haven’t given up yet.<br/>
But right now you can only move a single believer. <br/>
It seems you can affect the people that touch that dagger for a brief period of time, but you probably can’t do much with that.<br/>
Speaking of which, you were the one who told me to make the comrades of the boy stronger, Noah-sama.<br/>
I got that order from you the moment the seal was undone.<br/>
(That’s right, you did well, old man. That boy goes wild on his own and gets in near death situations, so if I don’t make his comrades stronger, it would be dangerous.) (Noah)<br/>
Honestly speaking, I don’t understand what that was for.<br/>
You didn’t give any orders to that important believer, right?<br/>
It seems like he is at least aiming for the Deep Sea Temple you are in.<br/>
Though, I don’t think he would be able to reach there…<br/>
(It is okay. I have my own plans. Fufufu!) (Noah)<br/>
Well, you seem to have some deliberate forethought.<br/>
I will simply obey.<br/>
"…Farewell, Noah-ojousama."<br/>
(Move carefully. Don’t let them notice you.) (Noah)<br/>
After saying this, I couldn’t hear the voice of Noah-ojousama anymore.<br/>
Now then, let’s go search for our comrades. <br/>
◇◇<br/>
"Maan, Takki-dono! That comrade of your Goddess is one great guy." (Fujiwara)<br/>
On our way back to the city.<br/>
Fuji-yan was real energetic.<br/>
"Now that you mention it, why did you take the finger of that giant, Goshujin-sama?" (Nina)<br/>
"Aah, that was something I am interested in as well." (Makoto)<br/>
Nina-san and I ask.<br/>
"Fufufu, this finger of the giant is a magic crystal that has unbelievable energy in it. If it is used as a weapon, it could destroy a single whole country." (Fujiwara)<br/>
"Eh? Wait! Isn’t that dangerous?" (Lucy)<br/>
Lucy immediately takes distance from Fuji-yan.<br/>
"I won’t use it for something like that. But man, that was a really fruitful adventure-desu zo." (Fujiwara)<br/>
"Right, I got an incredible divine protection." (Nina)<br/>
Fuji-yan and Nina-san were all smiles.<br/>
"Fufufufu!" (Lucy)<br/>
Lucy is holding the staff that the old man giant modified with real care.<br/>
She tested out her spells a number of times with it, and it seems like it has become quite the cheat weapon.<br/>
It apparently activates the spell just by putting the mana in.<br/>
It has bad mana cost, but it works perfectly for Lucy who has mana to spare.<br/>
They are all really satisfied.<br/>
◇◇<br/>
I look at the dagger of the Goddess.<br/>
I feel like the Goddess this time around wasn’t acting like herself.<br/>
There weren’t short snides like usual.<br/>
And she interfered directly in a way as if she timed it.<br/>
Moreover, what was deep inside the dungeon was a comrade of the Goddess.<br/>
I felt some sort of prefabricated air from it.<br/>
I am the only believer of the Goddess.<br/>
This is something I learned not that long ago, but it seems someone that can see the figure of the God and converse with them is called an Apostle.<br/>
An Oracle is considered sort of an Apostle.<br/>
They can only hear their voice.<br/>
Apostles can see their God.<br/>
Apostles can hear their God’s voice.<br/>
If the Apostle worries, the God will give them advice.<br/>
If the Apostle gets lost, the God will show them the way.<br/>
If the Apostle prays, they can obtain Divine Protection.<br/>
It is a whole bunch of good things.<br/>
But…Apostles can’t go against the orders of the God.<br/>
Once an oracle comes, the Apostle cannot go against it.<br/>
They have to perform the order of the God even at the cost of their life.<br/>
That’s the rule apparently.<br/>
The Goddess said:<br/>
"Get strong." <br/>
"I won’t forgive you if you die." <br/>
"Devote yourself." <br/>
These are apparently ‘requests’.<br/>
The current me probably cannot perform the orders of the Goddess.<br/>
I am weak.<br/>
I am an apprentice mage after all.<br/>
But…<br/>
It should be clear one day.<br/>
What is the true wish (order) of the Goddess.<br/>
