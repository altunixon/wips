Arifureta After II   The Part-Time Leader Lily   Second Part<br/>
<br/>
Part 1<br/>
*ding ding* The bell chimes rang. It was a withdrawn sound that felt pleasant to the ear.<br/>
「Welcome.」<br/>
The two young male customers who entered were immediately addressed by a voice. The voice came from a small distance away, but it was a pleasant and refreshing voice that didn’t lose to the bell’s chimes.<br/>
When they turned their gazes due to the lure of the voice, there was a stunningly beautiful girl there. It was a blonde-haired and blue-eyed girl wearing a cute apron. Her luxuriant hair was tied on the back using a largish frilly ribbon.<br/>
Looking from the logo on the apron, the silver tray in one hand, and the plate placed on the other hand, it was obvious from a glance that this was this restaurant’s employee.<br/>
「Dear guest. I will guide you to your seat right after this, so can I please ask you to wait for a bit?」<br/>
「「Ah, yes」」<br/>
The two male customers replied in beautiful harmony. The waitress-san smiled cheerfully. The two of them staggered.<br/>
The waitress advanced smoothly through the gaps between the tables with light footsteps and set down the plates she carried with a movement that even displayed elegance somewhat. The two female customers who received their orders were staring in a daze at the waitress.<br/>
After that, the waitress once more gave a stunningly beautiful bow and smiled like a blooming flower at the two female customers who unconsciously returned the bow. The two female customers were shot through.<br/>
The waitress returned to the two male customers and bowed. A sweet aroma spread gently from the swaying hair of golden threads.<br/>
「I’m sorry for making you wait. Smoking seats or non-smoking seats, which one will be your preference?」<br/>
「E, either is fine.」<br/>
「Me, me too.」<br/>
The two male customers followed the waitress as though they were being lured by the constant smile. Even after they were sat, their gazes were kept glued to the waitress who was going to bring some water and wet towels.<br/>
They were handed the menu by the returning waitress. She then said「Please call me when you’ve decided your order」before she was about to withdraw, but one man reflexively called out.<br/>
「He, hey. Before this, you weren’t working here, right?」<br/>
It was a sudden question, but the waitress that guessed this customer had gone to this restaurant before this nodded briefly.<br/>
「Yes. I started working part-time here just recently――I’m called Liliana. If I can become the acquaintance of you honored customers from here on――that will be great.」<br/>
She cutely smiled while bowing with her fingertips slightly clutching the tip of her skirt. That gesture swiftly shot through the two males. With the way how at the end of her sentence her polite language broke down slightly, it caused a sense of familiarity to well up inside the two male customers.<br/>
「I super will become your acquaintance.」<br/>
「Rather already we are become your acquaintance.」<br/>
The Japanese of the two male customers crumbled.<br/>
After that, there was a profoundly mysterious happening when Liliana came to take their order, for some reason, they ordered things from the menu one after another, even things that they didn’t feel like ordering were ordered following Liliana’s recommendation. The two looked like they were satisfied on the whole.<br/>
「Yuuka-san, I’ll be bringing more orders. Please take care of it.」<br/>
「Yes ye~s」<br/>
The chef who was wielding the frying pan inside the kitchen――Sonobe Yuuka replied back lightly.<br/>
It seemed that she had just finished cooking. She beautifully served the contents of the frying pan on the plate and faced toward the counter with the plate in one hand.<br/>
She was wearing a pure white chef coat and a crimson scarf on her neck. The limp beret on her head was also crimson colored.<br/>
In her student days, she had a serious character, but her appearance was showy, so she gave an impression of a frivolous gal. But right now, she was a splendid war potential of the western restaurant that was managed by her family. She was a chef who would become the second generation of this restaurant in the future.<br/>
It was only her dyed chestnut colored hair that didn’t change, but the atmosphere she was clad in was somehow mature and kind. The look in her eyes that could be called as sharp, if it had to be said, also seemingly looked like they had softened. Naturally, those factors also boosted her charm, which had existed since the beginning, by several times over.<br/>
In fact, there were a lot of regular customers who frequently visited this western restaurant"Wisteria"aiming for the beautiful chef. Also, this restaurant was established just a bit before Yuuka was born, so it had already welcomed its twenty year anniversary; there were also a lot of veteran customers who extremely enjoyed seeing the growth of Yuuka who they often helped since she was small.<br/>
「Yes, this is Kuban-san’s meat pie, take it, please. So, the next order is……」<br/>
Yuuka looked at the order tag she received from Liliana, and her eyes blinked repeatedly. And then, she leaned her body out from the kitchen counter and took a look at the table where Liliana had taken the order just now.<br/>
Over there were two young male customers.<br/>
Yuuka dropped her gaze at the order tag once more. No matter how she looked at it, there was an order for about six people written there.<br/>
「……Since Liliana worked here, the customers became really big eaters huh.」<br/>
「Yes, Japanese people are all gormandizer, aren’t they?」<br/>
Yuuka lifted her gaze from the order tag and sent an unblinking stare at Liliana, but then she sighed seeing Liliana putting on a friendly smile.<br/>
「Well, they all ate the food without leaving any, so it’s not a problem but……be careful not to make them force themselves too much okay.」<br/>
「Please leave it to me, Yuuka-san. It’s my specialty to see through to where the limit is. I’ll use every method available and make the sales and repeaters to be double the last month’s. I’ll bet on my honor as a former princess!」<br/>
「It’s fine even if you don’t bet that. Anyway, calm down first, former princess.」<br/>
Seeing Liliana whose nose breathed roughly with overflowing motivation, Yuuka acted the straight-man while smiling wryly.<br/>
「Now then, it will soon be the time when the customers will come in force. Let’s put on our fighting spirit. I think it will be fine because Otou-san and Okaa-san will also be returning soon, but until then, spare me from the number of orders that I cannot deal with alone, okay?」<br/>
「It’s fine. I have finished grasping Yuuka-san’s ability. I will take orders in the amount where Yuuka-san can just barely manage!」<br/>
「Ah, yep. ――This, rather than being a rehabilitation for Liliana, isn’t this actually a trial for me?」<br/>
Liliana said ‘Leave it to me!’ while putting the meats pie on her tray and headed out to give it to the customer. Yuuka murmured so while seeing her back.<br/>
After that, the two parents of Yuuka returned from their business, and the number of customers sharply increased when it approached evening. Liliana, who made the Sonobe family scream from the number of orders that were coming in like a surging wave, then clocked out when it was time for her to depart for another part-time job.<br/>
After that, everyone in the Sonobe family was left behind looking dead tired.<br/>
The customers also became sparse and after about an hour till it became time to close the restaurant for the day, *ding* the bell rang.<br/>
「Welco――wait, what, isn’t this Nagumo?」<br/>
Yuuka had left the kitchen and was now sorting the cash register’s sales slip. Just as she stated, ahead of her gaze was Hajime.<br/>
「What do you mean by ‘what’ when you are greeting a customer.」<br/>
Hajime entered the restaurant with a wry smile while sitting on the seat at the edge of the counter with a practiced movement. That spot was tacitly a reserved seat for Hajime who had now become a regular customer.<br/>
Since the party of the one year anniversary of returning home, Hajime, who was pleased with this restaurant’s cooking and coffee and also because of the friendly atmosphere due to the management who was his classmate and her family, sometimes visited now and then.<br/>
The other classmates too, even after graduating high school they would aimlessly drop by several times a month, and when they gathered for a meal, they would mostly gather at Yuuka’s restaurant, so this place became something like a hang-out place for the other world summoning group.<br/>
……Although, Hajime was also made to feel an extremely unwilling feeling because, for some reason, he received an extremely disgraceful impression that said「He is like a man going to his mistress’s place for an affair」from his family and friends.<br/>
Even though most times when he was here he would be with one or more of his wives, yet why he was still evaluated like that……. It was something that was greatly baffling for Hajime.<br/>
And then, those wives who were mostly with him when he was here, especially recently, would be staring at Yuuka with a fixed gaze; just why was it like that…….<br/>
When Hajime sat down, Yuuka’s father that had replaced her to cook in the kitchen――Hiroshi, and Yuuka’s mother Yuuri, addressed Hajime「Welcome」looking very happy.<br/>
Hajime returned the greeting and then Yuuka, who left behind the sales slips, asked him.<br/>
「And, are you coming to eat? It’s rare for you to come alone.」<br/>
「No, I finished having dinner already. I came here just to drink coffee a bit and also ask about how our part-time princess is doing.」<br/>
「Aa, I see.」<br/>
When Yuuka turned her gaze to her father, Hiroshi nodded as though to say「I don’t mind」. In exchange, Yuuri moved to take over sorting the sales slip. For some reason, she was giving a thumbs up at Yuuka while she was at it.<br/>
Yuuka asked while pretending not to see her mother who was like that.<br/>
「Are you okay with blended coffee?」<br/>
「Ou. Or rather, are you the one making it?」<br/>
Hajime tilted his head because if he remembered right, even though Yuuka had become able to be entrusted with cooking, she shouldn’t have been entrusted with making coffee yet.<br/>
Seeing Hajime’s questioning face, Yuuka showed a bit of a triumphant look while she swiftly prepared to make the coffee.<br/>
「Yesterday I finally got the okay. I also took the barista qualification test already. This is more or less the first blend that I will serve to a customer, so drink it with care.」<br/>
「What’s with that condescending attitude huh?」<br/>
A wry smile leaked out once more. The exchange between Hajime and Yuuka was very relaxed between each other from this kind of visit that spanned for several years. This was related to the impression of「He is like a man going to his mistress’s place for an affair」, but the two of them didn’t have an awareness of that.<br/>
A fragrant aroma enveloped the space. Hajime made a wondering expression at the coffee that was presented to him and brought it to his mouth to test how good it was. And then, a beat later, he went「Oh」with his eyes snapped open in admiration. And then, without pause, he took the second and then third gulp. From that, it seemed that Yuuka’s first blend was a good work.<br/>
Yuuka made a delighted expression that was mixed with a little bit of relief while she slouched forward a bit and rested her chin on her hand above the counter. Her other hand was playing around with her crimson scarf with her fingertips twirling it, and one of her feet was tapping *ton ton* on the floor with her toes.<br/>
「So? What is it that you want to ask? Lily is doing really well here though?」<br/>
「Is that so? She is a princess and shouldn’t have any experience in a service trade, but she doesn’t become a bother about various things because of that?」<br/>
「Nope, rather she is serving the customer so perfectly it is wasted for this kind of neighborhood western restaurant. She is elegant and refined――and it looks like there are already customers coming here for Lily.」<br/>
「Just from two weeks?」<br/>
「Yep, just from two weeks. And not just that, she even gave advice for the management. It’s to the level that it feels like we got the scale falling from our eyes. You know, she was having fun when she calculated how much the expenses this month got reduced.」<br/>
「As expected from the addict of an office job. Just why is she doing consultation even though this is part-time job huh?」<br/>
Hajime sighed in exasperation. A smile emerged on Yuuka’s lips with a chuckle seeing such a Hajime.<br/>
「Well, I too was anxious at first though. Suddenly, a call came from Nagumo telling me"Won’t you try hiring a former princess for a part-time job", what’s with that? I myself am still a novice, and it’s the best I can do just doing my own part. But, well, now I’m glad that Lily came to work here.」<br/>
「Is that so……. I too was really worried about letting Lily go part-time at a place I don’t know about at all. At that point, if it’s Sonobe, then I can trust you; and so, I entrusted her here……it’s great if her being here also benefited this place.」<br/>
「……As always, you are overprotective toward your relatives huh. Today too, you came directly here to expressly check on her.」<br/>
Yuuka’s expression turned into an exasperated one. However, her fingertips were twirling and toying her crimson scarf even more. The tapping of her foot became even more rhythmical *ton, toton-*.<br/>
For some reason, the mother who was in the middle of sorting the sales slip was grinning broadly seeing such a Yuuka.<br/>
「Well, I can’t deny being overprotective but……I’m coming today because that girl is starting to act unexpectedly, no, in a sense, it’s just as expected from her I guess. Hey, Sonobe. When she was in the middle of working, did Lily’s atmosphere feel like she was unsatisfied somewhat?」<br/>
「Eh? ……H~m, I didn’t really feel anything like that. She was in really high spirits when taking orders, and she was scattering around courtesy so much it was starting to increase repeaters. Why are you asking? By any chance, did she say that working part-time here is dull for her?」<br/>
「No no, she isn’t saying anything like that. Rather, she was saying that she is having fun.」<br/>
Yuuka tilted her head at Hajime who spoke evasively.<br/>
Hajime hesitated a little before he confirmed it with Yuuka「I’ve told you the details about why Lily is working part-time, right?」. When Yuuka nodded, Hajime continued.<br/>
「Since a week ago, that Lily, she often didn’t come home.」<br/>
「Somehow, that line sounds like something that would be said by a no good husband who let her wife run away.」<br/>
「Shut up. And then. When I tried asking what she is doing, it seemed that she is also starting to work part-time with the supplier that is doing business with your place. She said the work is completely desk work.」<br/>
「Eh? Is that so?」<br/>
That fact caused the eyes of Yuuka who didn’t know that to turn round. But, it appeared the story didn’t stop there.<br/>
「It seemed the fare configuration of that supplier is problematic, and then while Lily was talking about various things to the supplier, she then got scouted by the person of that company. I don’t know what kind of talk she had with them though.」<br/>
「He, hee. I wonder since when it became like that.」<br/>
「Yeah exactly. But, even with that, it’s unthinkable that she would be so busy that she needed to be absent from several lectures at the college and became unable to come home. I’m only guessing but……」<br/>
「She is doing more part-time work?」<br/>
「Yeah.」<br/>
Hajime nodded while looking like he got a headache. Although it seemed he didn’t have positive proof, that was why he thought of asking Yuuka, whether Liliana was feeling insufficient just working part-time in this restaurant.<br/>
「You can just ask her directly.」<br/>
「That girl is giving me the slip. I don’t want to get the answer out of her forcefully. And observing her with artifacts will make me look like a controlling husband, so I don’t feel like doing that.」<br/>
「Oh, really.」<br/>
Hajime drank his coffee miserly while looking really worried, or perhaps overprotective, and yet for all that, he behaved indecisively. Yuuka replied curtly with an expression that looked disappointed to that.<br/>
「In the end, what are you going to do? When she is working part-time at our place, she doesn’t look like she is feeling insufficient, she looks like she is having quite some fun you know? Should I indirectly tell her that Nagumo is worrying? I don’t know if the workaholic Lily will be able to restrain herself by doing that, but perhaps she will talk to you by her own initiative what part-time work she is doing right now.」<br/>
「I, see. Can I ask you to do that?」<br/>
「Yes yes. It’s fine, doing just that much.」<br/>
Yuuka nodded while lazily waving her hand. Hajime drank his coffee and said thanks before standing up.<br/>
「My bad that I sounded like whining there. I feel relaxed when I come here every time. I guess it’s not just for show that you are the second generation owner of the place for relaxation that lured even the demon king.」<br/>
「Even if you praise me I cannot give you anything except delicious western meals and coffee okay. There also won’t be any discounts.」<br/>
「Uh oh, that’s unfortunate.」<br/>
The two cracked jokes to each other. Yuuka’s scarf was twirled around so much it was already starting to fray while her tapping toes were already like a tap dance.<br/>
Hajime said his goodbyes to Hiroshi and Yuuri and then exited the restaurant. Yuuka saw him off before closing the door, and when she turned around, there were her two parents there with truly nice smiling faces.<br/>
「……What?」<br/>
Yuuka asked with obvious wariness. In response, the gentle Yuuri,<br/>
「What to do, Hiroshi-san. This daughter of us, her trait is completely a mistress.」<br/>
「H, h~m. But from my standpoint, I wish that she will marry properly though.」<br/>
「Lo, look here! Just what are you two speaking about your daughter! I’m not Nagumo’s mistress, and I also got no plan to enter that guy’s harem!」<br/>
Yuuka howled. However, the chain of events just now was where a man with wives and kid unexpectedly showed up; then she treated him with food, heard his complaining, and gave him comfort――those acts, even considering that this place was a restaurant, seen from the side looked enough like a mistress.<br/>
Seeing her parents who lightly deflected「We get it, we get it」toward her words of denial, Yuuka became especially displeased.<br/>
However, it was natural that her words didn’t have any persuasiveness.<br/>
After all, Yuuka’s toes tapping *ton ton* on the floor was her habit when she was in a good mood. And furthermore, that habit wouldn’t come out just from being in a good mood; it would only come out if she also felt embarrassed at the same time.<br/>
In addition, there was the crimson scarf and limp beret that Yuuka was wearing. Actually, those items had a lot of color variety, but Yuuka only had those items in the crimson color, even including the spare. When she went to buy a replacement, as expected, she would pick crimson again. The same color as the light of the magic power of a certain someone.<br/>
And then, her habit of rolling around her scarf with her fingertips was a new habit that was formed these past several years. It was an unconscious habit that came out only when she was talking with a certain someone.<br/>
「Heey, Otou-san, Okaa-san? Are you two listening?」<br/>
「Yes yes, we get it already. We better start closing up the restaurant soon~」<br/>
「The most important thing for Otou-san is that Yuuka is happy, that’s all.」<br/>
「I, told, youu~~~」<br/>
The famous western restaurant"Wisteria". The frequently changing emotion between joy and anger of the second generation owner was also the specialty of this place.<br/>
Part 2<br/>
A month after Hajime showed just a bit of a good-for-nothing act at Yuuka’s restaurant.<br/>
Currently, everyone was gathering in the living room of Nagumo residence. The"120th something of the Nagumo Family Meeting"was opened.<br/>
The one who sat at the center of the large dining table was Hajime, and right in front of him was Liliana who was sitting with an awkward expression.<br/>
「Now then, Lily. Do you know what the meaning of this family meeting is?」<br/>
「u, mo, more or less……」<br/>
Liliana averted her face quickly to the side, but ahead of her gaze, there were Yue and the others who weren’t even hiding their exasperated expression. What gouged her heart especially deeply was that even Myuu was looking at her with eyes that appeared to be looking at someone hopeless.<br/>
Hajime was about to open his mouth toward Liliana whose gaze was swimming *sui~* to the opposite side.<br/>
But, before he could speak, *pururururu* a phone’s ringtone rang.<br/>
「Ah, I, I’m sorry. Please excuse me a bit.」<br/>
「Ah, oi, you」<br/>
Liliana looked the other way even when Hajime raised his voice while putting her own smartphone on her ear. And then, what could be heard after that were only words related to business like contracts or clients and so on.<br/>
Before long, it seemed that they had reached an end and Liliana cut off the call. Seeing that, Hajime sighed while opening his mouth.<br/>
But, before he could speak, *pururururu* a phone’s ringtone rang.<br/>
「Ah, I, I’m sorry. Please excuse me a bit.」<br/>
「……」<br/>
She answered the phone. This time, it seemed that there was a problem occurring regarding the shift at her part-time workplace. Liliana was listening to the phone while going ‘uh-huh, uh-huh’ before she quickly started to give out instructions, like who to call, who to substitute for the shift change, what to do about the lacking place such and such, and then what she wanted to be dealt with next and so on……<br/>
Hajime wanted to act the straight-man ‘Managing shift schedules obviously ain’t the work of a part-timer right!?’, but for the time being he endured it.<br/>
Before long, the talk came to an end, and Liliana cut off the phone. Hajime then sighed while opening his mouth.<br/>
But, before he could speak, *pururururu* a phone’s ringtone rang.<br/>
「Ah, I, I’m sorry. Please excuse me a bit.」<br/>
「……」<br/>
Liliana answered the phone. For some reason, there was a sobbing voice coming from the other side of the phone. Liliana was consoling her talking partner while sometimes also reprimanding, and then in order to deal with a grave problem that seemed to occur from some kind of miss, she took out one more smartphone from her pocket and quickly began to give out instructions.<br/>
Before long, it seemed that she finished and Liliana cut off the phone. Hajime, who got a vein pulsing on his forehead, was opening his mouth.<br/>
But, before he could, *gatari* the sound of someone standing up from a chair resounded.<br/>
「I’m sorry, Hajime-san. It seems that the section chi――cough-, a regular employee who was entrusted with an important project made a miss, and it turned out into something that a part-time worker like me has to deal with. And so, I’ll go out for a bit!」<br/>
A part-time worker that followed up for a regular employee’s miss. Or rather, a regular employee who came crying to a part-time employee even though it was his miss. Furthermore, it seemed this regular employee was a section chief.<br/>
Since when did the definition of part-time work change drastically like this.<br/>
Liliana quickly put her outfit in order while saying things like「At this rate, the two hundred employees there will be out in the cold! As a part-time leader, I have to do something」before she tried to go outside.<br/>
*snap-* One more vein emerged on Hajime’s forehead. And then a word.<br/>
「Shia.」<br/>
「Yes sir desuuu」<br/>
From behind, the rabbit-eared wife who was dancing to the same beat as the husband embraced Liliana who right now was about to exit the room.<br/>
「Shi, Shia-san? I’m sorry, but I’m going to wo――」<br/>
「Yes yes, I’ll just make you cool your head a bit heree」<br/>
「Eh? Wai-, NOOOOOO-」<br/>
Liliana screamed, and then after that, she received an artistic German suplex and the floor struck the back of her head.「My head-, my head hurts like it got splitttttt-」The former princess was shouting while rolling around on the floor in agony.<br/>
「Uu, just what are you doing. After this, I have an important work……」<br/>
「Is that, something more important than the family discussion?」<br/>
Liliana complained while rubbing the back of her head with teary eyes. Hajime asked her with a sigh mixed in it.「Uu-」Liliana was at lost for words, and Hajime said in response.<br/>
「If that’s how it is, then I’ll attempt to solve the root of the problem and make it so that you lose your reason for going.」<br/>
「E, err, Hajime-san, what do you mean specifically?」<br/>
「……Today’s weather is sunny, but it seems that there will be a random meteor shower later.」<br/>
「Let’s have a discussion.」<br/>
Indeed, the root of the problem would be cleared. If there wasn’t any troubled person, then there also wouldn’t be any trouble.<br/>
Feeling how unbearable it would be if the meteor shower that once annihilated the capital of her own country was dropped on her part-time workplace, Liliana took her seat in a panic.<br/>
「Look at you, even though recently you were grieving because not to mention me, you weren’t able to even converse satisfactorily with anyone in the family because of work, work, work, but then you tried to get out abruptly from the discussion to talk about that, just what’s with that?」<br/>
「Tha, that’s, obviously, even I am also fed up here you know, Hajime-san? I really want to yell out loudly, ‘just why are they all relying on just me, please manage it somehow just by yourself.’ But, before I realized it, everyone relied on me, and I was placed in a position with responsibility, and now it’s really hard to break out from it.」<br/>
「Even though it’s part-time work?」<br/>
「Even though it’s part-time work, yes.」<br/>
Hajime sighed for who knew how many times already. He then handed over the mirror he had prepared to Liliana who was talking with a voice that couldn’t hide her emotion of「I’m fed up already」.<br/>
The face that was reflected in the mirror was the creepy face of the workaholic Lily with fierily blazing eyes.<br/>
Liliana gently put down the mirror.<br/>
「This is a mistake. It’s not like I’m starved or anything. This is a misunderstanding. Thanks to doing a moderate amount of work from the part-time job, day by day, I’m in the process of getting closer to becoming "a normal girl" ――」<br/>
「Including the part-time job at Sonobe’s place, how many part-time jobs are you currently holding?」<br/>
「……I, it’s, seven.」<br/>
「The job description?」<br/>
「A, a bit of managing inventory and dealing with the client.」<br/>
「Other than that?」<br/>
「Something like fast food restaurant.」<br/>
「The specific.」<br/>
「……I’m in charge of the part-time workers at the main restaurant while being entrusted to coordinate the surrounding seven branch restaurants.」<br/>
「The call just now?」<br/>
「At another establishment related with food and drink where I’m working part-time, various things happened, and I work as an advisor of the head office trade section……It seems there was a miss at the transaction that was started from my advice where the company’s fortune is at stake, and at this rate, it would get a complete revocation. If that happens, depending on the situation there, then there is even the possibility that the company will go under.」<br/>
Hajime wordlessly pushed out the mirror. It was as though he was an exorcist that was pushing out a cross toward a girl who was possessed by a devil! What was reflected in that mirror was a creepy face that seemed to say「This is a heavy responsibility you know, Lily! Gufufuh」……<br/>
Immediately,「Stooppp――. Don’t show me the mirrorrr――!!」Liliana writhed in agony.<br/>
……She was completely like a girl who was possessed by a devil.<br/>
「Yes yes, at~~ten~~tion! Now that we have confirmed that presently Lily-chan’s workaholic level hasn’t improved at all, everyone, please state your opinion!」<br/>
Sumire, who held the role as the chairman of the meeting, tapped the table *kan kan* with a spoon and asked for the opinion of everyone.<br/>
「Yes!」The one who raised her hand first was Myuu. Sumire pointed with a fork at Myuu「Yes, Myuu-chan!」. Her manner was really bad.<br/>
「I think that Lily-oneechan’s addiction won’t be fixed even if she died!」<br/>
「Kafuh!?」<br/>
Myuu launched her words like a bullet of an anti-material grade rifle with a cheerful smile on her face. Liliana pressed her chest and collapsed.<br/>
Next,「Yes desuu!」was Shia with her rabbit ears standing straight. Sumire pointed sharply with long chopsticks「Yes, Shia-chan!」. Just where did she take it out from?<br/>
「I think that something like rehabilitation is meaningless to fix a person’s core nature desuu!」<br/>
「Guhih!?」<br/>
That opinion actually had much persuasiveness. A~ll of Shia’s family were people with screwed up core natures. Incidentally, Shia’s self-proclaimed best friend, the princess of the elves, was also a pervert at the core. Soon, she might turn from her best friend into her step-mother. However, regarding this case, Shia was averting her rabbit ears from the reality.<br/>
The next one who hurriedly raised her hand was Tio. After her, Remia also raised her hand while smiling. Sumire said「Yes Tio-chan, Remia-chan!」while pointing with a snap using a ladle. For a moment, it looked like the ladle materialized from empty air……was that just an illusion?<br/>
「For example, if I hath mine butt spanked moderately in the name of rehabilitation, and then asked if this nature of mine can be fixed by that or not, then the answer is it’s impossible! This art the same.」<br/>
「What a hardship. Even though she wishes to stop working and be together with her family, without working she will be frustrated……it will be great if there is something else other than work that she can do.」<br/>
「Uu. I’m the same as Tio-san……even if you ask me something other than work……after all, I’m just a hollow person……hics-」<br/>
Liliana lost her nerve. And then she fell down before starting to trace circles on the floor with her fingertip in an easy to understand gesture.<br/>
「Nn-」Yue raised her hand. Sumire said「Yes, Yue-chan!」while pointing with a frying pan for rolled eggs so hard it made a *buon* sound. ……It looked like she took it out from her cuff though.<br/>
Beside Sumire, Shuu’s eyes were sparkling, 「Sumire, you, your party performance skill has gone up again!」his tension was climbing up to the sky.<br/>
「……You want, remodeling?」<br/>
「Hiih!? No thank you!」<br/>
‘That difficult nature, want me to remodel it along with your soul?’ Yue wriggled her hands while standing up from her chair. In response to that, Liliana screamed while dragging her body backward.<br/>
Hajime gave a glance at Liliana who was trembling like Davis-kun before he scratched his head and opened his mouth.<br/>
「Well, it’s positive that this nature of Liliana cannot be fixed just from doing part-time work.」<br/>
「Uu, Hajime-san?」<br/>
Liliana’s shoulders dropped despondently.<br/>
Hajime’s gaze ran around toward Yue and the others. He judged that they all had reached a conclusion. And then, he made Liliana sit on her chair in order to tell her that conclusion.<br/>
「Lily. Anyway, these two months of rehabilitation turned out meaningless, that’s why, how about if in the next two months you don’t do anything?」<br/>
「Not doing, anything?」<br/>
Liliana was bewildered. Hajime nodded「Yeah」. In a sense, this was a shocking proposal for Liliana.<br/>
「Resign from all your part-time jobs, and then, become a shut-in NEET for two months.」<br/>
「Eh?」<br/>
Like this, with the unanimous vote from"The 80th or 130th, well it doesn’t matter which, of the Nagumo Family Meeting", it was decided that the princess of another world was to become a shut-in NEET.<br/>
By the way, regarding the mismanagement of a certain trade department that made a miss, it was resolved in moderation by Hajime due to Lily’s entreaty. Of course, it was resolved using a way that wasn’t a random meteor shower on a sunny day.<br/>

AN: Thank you very much for reading this every time.<br/>
Thank you very much too for the thoughts, opinions, and reports about misspelling and omitted words.<br/>
I uploaded three chapters consecutively for the celebration of this story’s resumption, but for some reason, this Lily arc didn’t end.<br/>
Unexpectedly, I had fun writing, and unconsciously the story got dragged on.<br/>
Especially how it became as though this is Yuuka’s turn even though this is Lily’s arc……Lily, how pitiful.<br/>
Now then, my deepest apologies, but next week’s update for Saturday will be Lily’s arc too.<br/>
In this After II, I’m thinking to try to write about the wives or classmates that didn’t get spotlights.<br/>
And when I finish with that, unexpectedly there are a lot of wishful voices, and Shirakome himself is also getting in the mood for it, so I’m thinking that perhaps I should try writing about the story of Kouki-kun who got kidnapped too muchhh.<br/>
Well then, please take care of Arifureta from here on too.<br/>
