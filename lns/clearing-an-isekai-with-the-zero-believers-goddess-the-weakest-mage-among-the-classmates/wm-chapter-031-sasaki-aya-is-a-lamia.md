<br/>
Mother, father, little brothers, are you doing well? <br/>
I am doing well.<br/>
I am doing my best in a far away world.<br/>
But…I am feeling the worst, though…<br/>
I have been reborn as a snake.<br/>
I thought this was a nightmare, but I wasn’t dreaming.<br/>
This is something I recently learned.<br/>
This is not Earth.<br/>
There’s the chance that I might have been reborn as a never found UMA, but there shouldn’t be a living being like this on Earth.<br/>
The race I am is apparently the Lamia race.<br/>
This is something I heard from Mother-sama who gave birth to me.<br/>
I have recently gotten used to being surrounded 360° by snakes. I am amazing.<br/>
I am glad I am a girl that’s okay with reptiles.<br/>
Also, the biggest grace was that…<br/>
"Hey hey, wasn’t the frog just now delicious?" <br/>
"I prefer bugs." <br/>
"Earthworms taste bad." <br/>
My sisters that were completely snakes when born, their upper bodies have become cute girls.<br/>
Their conversations are not cute at all though.<br/>
I am also not just a snake anymore.<br/>
I repeated shedding several times, and have obtained a human-like upper half.<br/>
"Now, little sisters. It is time for the meal." <br/>
The meals of us little sisters are being brought by our older sisters (snake women).<br/>
Mother-sama apparently doesn’t work. <br/>
She is our pillar after all!<br/>
There’s no father it seems.<br/>
I tried asking once to my sister whether we have a father, and she told me with a scary face: "I recommend you don’t say that to Mother-sama".<br/>
There must be an underlying reason.<br/>
Now then, food.<br/>
I am a few months old.<br/>
I have the hearty appetite of a growing child.<br/>
We as the youngest children can apparently eat first, but…<br/>
Mouse, frog, lizard, spider, hornworm, bird, crucian carp-looking fish, and there’s also a mountain of something that resembles nuts. <br/>
""""""Yaaay.""""""<br/>
My sisters swarm it.<br/>
(I wonder if this can be eaten…) <br/>
For now, I choose some nuts and begin eating.<br/>
But with only these, the nutrients will end up getting skewed.<br/>
I had no choice but to look at the other things too…<br/>
(Haaah…it is impossible.) <br/>
Lamias don’t have the custom of using fire or spices. They normally just swallow their food whole.<br/>
With a side glance at my sisters who are swallowing things like rats and frogs, I munch a small fish that seems edible.<br/>
(Eh? The older sisters seem to be carrying something here.) <br/>
They are carrying a heavy-looking something in what seems to be a jute bag.<br/>
It seems like they are carrying it to Mother-sama.<br/>
I have seen this before. They always carried the valuable food to mother.<br/>
A few days ago, it was a big cow-like animal.<br/>
"It was called a Minotauros! To defeat one, you would have to be as strong as Elder Sister-sama!" <br/>
I remember my older sisters talking proudly about that. <br/>
Elder Sister-sama is like a leader of ours, and is apparently the highest position after mother.<br/>
The no.2 in our family.<br/>
"Go ahead, Mother-sama." <br/>
They open the bag.<br/>
(Geh!) <br/>
"XXXXXXXXXXX?!!?!?!!!" <br/>
What came out was a human.<br/>
The person who is wearing what seems to be a metal armor was shouting something.<br/>
I can’t understand his words.<br/>
"Quite energetic." <br/>
Mother-sama coils around the human with her long body, and brushes his hair gently.<br/>
The human’s face turns pale in fear and he is trembling.<br/>
Mother-sama grins, and in the next instant, she ate him in one bite. <br/>
(Aaaaaaaah…!!) <br/>
I held my head.<br/>
I was even wondering if in this world there’s only monsters, but it was a world where there’s humans.<br/>
And it seems like we eat humans. <br/>
"What do humans taste I wonder.", "I heard they are tastier than monsters.", "The older sisters apparently have eaten some.", "I am jealous.", "I want to go hunt soon."<br/>
I could hear the innocent voices of my sisters.<br/>
The contents of their conversation are scary though.<br/>
"Haaah… It will be impossible to live together with humans, huh…" <br/>
I thought that if there’s actually humans in this world, I could secretly sneak out and go to a human settlement.<br/>
Cause you know, the food isn’t good! <br/>
But judging from how scared the human was just now, and my mother who swallowed him whole…<br/>
The chance of coexisting is despairingly low.<br/>
"You look down there. What’s the matter?" <br/>
Elder Sister-sama caught me while I was sighing.<br/>
"N-No, it is just that I was thinking I would like to go out too sometime soon." <br/>
I answered with whatever came to mind.<br/>
"Hmm, you were the one who hatched out the fastest within the little sisters, right? It is true that it is about time you girls also get your own prey." <br/>
Ooh! I can get out from here? <br/>
We actually haven’t taken a step out of this nest yet.<br/>
Our den is a dark place like a cave. It is plenty wide, but they said that the outside is dangerous, so we weren’t allowed outside.<br/>
"Tomorrow will be your first outing. Tell your other sisters too." <br/>
Elder Sister-sama left with those words.<br/>
Hm? I have to tell them all?<br/>
What a pain.<br/>
◇◇<br/>
"Waah~, amazing." <br/>
"The outside is so bi~g." <br/>
The sisters are going kya kya.<br/>
And me, I was dumbfounded.<br/>
"Fuwaaaah…" <br/>
Our den was a cave behind a big waterfall. <br/>
The closer we got to the exit, the higher the sound of a massive amount of water coming down was heard.<br/>
The sprays of water became mist and made the surroundings white and hard to see. <br/>
If you tried to go through the waterfall, you would just get slammed down, so we come out from a path at the side.<br/>
"Niagara Falls?" <br/>
I haven’t seen the actual thing, but the wall of water that covers a whole side of my vision reminded me of one of the largest waterfalls in my previous world.<br/>
This giant waterfall created a big lake.<br/>
To think there would be such a big underground lake! <br/>
This is so amazing! <br/>
"Hey! Don’t space out and come here already." <br/>
Hurried by an older sister, we were made to move without being given the time to enjoy the superb view.<br/>
"This place is the hunting grounds of you girls." <br/>
The place the older sister pointed at was one of the lakes in an open space where the splashing water of the waterfall doesn’t reach.<br/>
"""Yeessss."""<br/>
The sisters disperse wilfully. <br/>
"Don’t go too far, okay?! The places with deep water have monsters, got it?!" <br/>
‘Aren’t we monsters, too?’, is what I thought, but I didn’t say.<br/>
I move around by hopping from one rock to another.<br/>
I was wondering if there were any fishes, but because of the waterfall, the water is waving, and I can’t see the inside of the water properly.<br/>
I look up, and the surroundings of this underground place have a massive waterfall falling endlessly.<br/>
Moreover, on top of that, I could see the light of the sun coming in.<br/>
Looks like up here is working as an atrium of sorts.<br/>
I was spaced out watching the sunlight that it has been so long since I haven’t seen, and there I saw a shadow flying.<br/>
A bird?<br/>
The dark shadow was flying as if drawing a circle.<br/>
"Oi! You girls! Come back!" <br/>
I heard the agitated voice of the older sister.<br/>
"It is a harpy!"<br/>
Eh? <br/>
The moment I thought that, it was too late.<br/>
"Kiyaaaaaa!!" <br/>
That thing raised a cry and lunged at us.<br/>
The upper body was that of a woman, the lower was that of a bird monster.<br/>
"Eh? Eeeeeeeh?!" <br/>
By the time I noticed, I had been grabbed by the legs of the harpy and was being carried away.<br/>
"Everyone, return quickly. That girl is already done for!" <br/>
Eh?! Is she referring to me?! <br/>
Wait, don’t give up, Onee-sama! <br/>
"Hihihihihi!" <br/>
The woman face bird body monster grabbing me warped her beautiful face into a disgusting grin, and was laughing.<br/>
Damn it, she is looking down on me thinking I am a child.<br/>
"Ei!" <br/>
I forcefully wrench open the claws grabbing me.<br/>
What, this monster is totally weak! <br/>
"Eh?!"<br/>
In the time the harpy was surprised, I wrapped around her body.<br/>
And just like that, I constrict her.<br/>
"G-Get off me!" <br/>
Idioot, as if I would.<br/>
We are falling down while entangled.<br/>
We drop right into the water just like that.<br/>
It was kind of rough there, but I managed to land safely. <br/>
Okay, let’s run.<br/>
I swim inside the water smoothly, and aim for the back of the waterfall where our den is.<br/>
"Gyaaaaa!" <br/>
I heard a scream from my back, and when I look back, the harpy of before was being eaten by a gigantic crocodile-like monster.<br/>
(Eeeeeeeh?! What’s that?! Scary! There was something like that?)<br/>
I hurried with everything I had and regrouped with my sisters.<br/>
When I returned, everyone praised me for defeating a harpy in my first hunt.<br/>
No, I am not happy at all! <br/>
What’s with this wo~rld?! <br/>
