SS: Pochi and Scary Thing<br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
"Pochi, would you like to hear a nice story?"<br/>
"That face is a bad face nanodesu. Arisa is going to trick Pochi nodesu."<br/>
"No~way, I won't do such thing you know?"<br/>
<br/>
Arisa talked about some great thing nodesu.<br/>
I can say goodbye to the fish life with this nodesu.<br/>
<br/>
"Master! It's terrible nanodesu."<br/>
"What's wrong?"<br/>
"Um, um, yes, Pochi is scared of meat nodesu."<br/>
"Hee, that's terrible."<br/>
"What if you're shown grilled meat?"<br/>
"I'd be so scared, I'd collapse nano desu."<br/>
<br/>
I cover my face with my hands, and do my utmost best to do 'I'm scared' appeal, just like Arisa's told me nodesu.<br/>
<br/>
"Then, what if you're shown steak?"<br/>
"I will scream and faint nodesu."<br/>
<br/>
This time I put my arms on my head and squat down.<br/>
<br/>
"I see~, it's terrible for Pochi huh."<br/>
"Yes nanodesu, it's terrible nanodesu."<br/>
<br/>
Master is laughing just like Arisa's said.<br/>
There are going to be a lot of meat tonight nanodesu!<br/>
<br/>
I mean, I can whiff the nice burning smell of the meat nodesu~♪<br/>
I'm excited with the anticipation of the dinner nano desu!<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
"Delicious~"<br/>
"It's tasty, master."<br/>
<br/>
Huh? Huh? Wait a minute nano desu.<br/>
It's strange desuyo?<br/>
<br/>
Even though there are steak on everyone's plate when I look around, on Pochi's plate it's.<br/>
<br/>
"Why is it a grilled fish nanodesu?"<br/>
"Pochi's said that meat are scary, so I make it a fish for you. You should have said it sooner."<br/>
<br/>
Master is smiling while laughing. I feel slightly happy, but that's not it. When I was being flustered while holding the plate, Arisa called out with a bad smile on her face nodesu.<br/>
<br/>
"What's wrong Pochi? Fish are also delicious you know?"<br/>
<br/>
A, Arisa, you've tricked me after all nodesu.<br/>
<br/>
"Alright, since Pochi might be scared of tea too, here's the water."<br/>
<br/>
Master passes a cup of water while giggling. Earlier, I've already said the punchline that Arisa taught me nodesu.<br/>
<br/>
I have neither dream or ingenuity nodesu.<br/>
<br/>
When I was staring at fish-san while slumping, Lulu traded the plate with the one with steak.<br/>
<br/>
"Mou, master, and also Arisa are playing around too much with Pochi-chan since she's cute."<br/>
"Sorry, Lulu, it just happened."<br/>
<br/>
Meat, meat nanodesu!<br/>
When I look around while surprised, everyone nods nodesu.<br/>
<br/>
"Master, is it alright to eat them?"<br/>
"It's alright, eat a lot."<br/>
<br/>
This time, I tell master normally that, "I want to eat meat nodesu."<br/>
And also, Lulu, thank you nanodesu.<br/>
<br/>
