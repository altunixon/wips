<br/>
A bit disappointed he doesn’t confront the idiot.<br/>
By the way, I have decided to instate a little… punishment when the next person asks when the next chapter is. You’ll see…<br/>
Chapter 160: Return to the Village<br/>
After Itsuki’s game ended, the coliseum continued to host other events but I didn’t feel like watching.<br/>
"I heard that the weapon shops here had a wide variety. I’m going to go check them out." (Naofumi)<br/>
"Should I show you around? Yes." (Slave Dealer)<br/>
"Yeah… I’ll leave it to you." (Naofumi)<br/>
It’s quite a bustling city. I think that it will be easy to get lost.<br/>
"Then, you there, please lead him around." (Slave Dealer)<br/>
A large muscular man raises his hand to announce his presence.<br/>
I follow him and arrive at the biggest market area in the city.<br/>
It reminds me of a mall from the other world.<br/>
"Well, well. If it isn’t the Hero of the Shield." (Accessory Merchant)<br/>
"I don’t know you." (Naofumi)<br/>
The Accessory merchant beckons to me from a nearby store. I act oblivious.<br/>
"This is one of the stores I manage. I’d definitely like to show off some of my wares." (Accessory Merchant)<br/>
So it’s his own store.<br/>
I can see some rubys on sale.<br/>
If I keep ignoring him here, I may come to regret it later.<br/>
I take a deep sigh and enter the store.<br/>
"You have quite a big store here." (Naofumi)<br/>
"Yes, is there anything you are particularly looking for?" (Accessory Merchant)<br/>
"I’m looking for weapons and armor." (Naofumi)<br/>
"Then you will want the second floor. Are you certain you have no interest in the accessories on the first floor?" (Accessory Merchant)<br/>
I scan the store’s interior. Sparkling gems are displayed in multiple cases and hung all over the walls. It’s too bright.<br/>
"I’m not interested." (Naofumi)<br/>
"By the way, is Hero-sama still using the techniques I taught you? You can’t make good equipment if you let your skills dull." (Accessory Merchant)<br/>
"I use them occasionally." (Naofumi)<br/>
I’ve made some accessories for the slaves out of monster materials.<br/>
Most of them now wear items made of monster bone.<br/>
The bone makes for quite potent accessories, giving numerous bonus effects. They also deteriorate slowly. The downside is that they don’t grant much stat boosts.<br/>
"Here, though it may look rough." (Naofumi)<br/>
I hand over an accessory I had randomly made in my free time.<br/>
"Wow! A bone accessory!?" (Accessory Merchant)<br/>
"… Is something wrong?" (Naofumi)<br/>
"What are you saying… The materials used to make it may be cheap, but the bonuses it grants will make it sell high among adventurers." (Accessory Merchant)<br/>
"It’s definitely cheap, but I’ve been practicing my design skills." (Naofumi)<br/>
"Obviously! By the way, is it true that you’ve recently acquired a large amount of land?" (Accessory Merchant)<br/>
"… If you want to set up a store there, then just go over." (Naofumi)<br/>
"I still have contracts here, you know!" (Accessory merchant)<br/>
The accessory merchant’s eyes shine with an evil light as he says this.<br/>
I hesitate before proceeding. Anyone would.<br/>
"Anyways, if you come over, make sure not to interfere with reconstruction. " (Naofumi)<br/>
"I know… Fufufu…" (Accessory Merchant)<br/>
Why is it that all the merchants I meet seem evil?<br/>
"How goes the selling of the Miraka accessories?" (Naofumi)<br/>
"They’re quite popular. After all, a great calamity did just occur… Even average civilians have begun training to protect themselves." (Accessory Merchant)<br/>
So his profit has increased.<br/>
"Well, I’m going off to check the weapon selection." (Naofumi)<br/>
"I look forwards to our next meeting." (Accessory Merchant)<br/>
"Yes, Yes." (Naofumi)<br/>
It enervates me dealing with this type of merchant.<br/>
I think as I proceed to the second floor.<br/>
Weapons are displayed everywhere like in an exhibition.<br/>
There are also various articles of clothing.<br/>
…hmm. There are some familiar weapons, such as the Meteor Iron Sword and the Meteor Iron Lance. They’re on sale for a bargain price.<br/>
Oh? There’s also Spirit Turtle armor here.<br/>
The variety here isn’t much different from Melromark.<br/>
And the price is exponentially higher.<br/>
Well I guess the price of imports are higher than they are in their original country.<br/>
… I look around for shields, but I don’t see many that I haven’t seen at the Old Man’s shop.<br/>
Well, there are a few unfamiliar shields. I guess I’ll try touching one.<br/>
"Ah, can I try equipping this shield for a second?" (Naofumi)<br/>
"Go ahead." (Store Clerk)<br/>
With the clerk’s consent, I lift up the unfamiliar shield. Weapon Copy activates.<br/>
Spike Shield, Frisbee Shield, Jewel Shield, Platinum Shield.<br/>
I copy all of the weapons unfamiliar to me.<br/>
I wonder how powerful these new additions are.<br/>
I haven’t really been fighting as of late… My stats are still effected by the curse.<br/>
I remember the Old Man saying that Spirit Turtle Materials were hard to work with, but that seems to be true.<br/>
In this large store, I don’t see any weapons made of the material.<br/>
"Hm?" (Naofumi)<br/>
I notice an item marked as ‘Not for Sale’.<br/>
It’s a single edged sword… With a glance, I can tell it is made for Spirit Turtle parts.<br/>
I try to appraise it.<br/>
Spirit Turtle Sword.<br/>
Quality …<br/>
It’s no good. My appraisal level isn’t high enough to get any info.<br/>
But I can see that it is quite skillfully made… It’s even being kept from sale.<br/>
Perhaps it shall be put up for auction in the near future.<br/>
So there really are skilled craftsmen in this world. However as I have no money, it doesn’t really concern me.<br/>
I’ll tell the Old Man about it later.<br/>
And so I stayed a little longer, then left<br/>
"You’re already back?" (Rishia)<br/>
As I return, I see Rishia waiting at our meeting spot with a depressed expression.<br/>
"I need to get the slaves I bought to the village. I don’t have any money for an inn for them all." (Naofumi)<br/>
I could just leave them at the Slave Merchant’s place and pick them up later, or I could send them back with Firo, but… I don’t want to risk Rishia finding Itsuki so it’s probably best to leave early.<br/>
Rafatalia is comforting Rishia while sweating profusely.<br/>
"Hey hey hey, why is Rafatalia Onee-chan…" (Firo)<br/>
"Quiet, bird." (Naofumi)<br/>
Firo stares at Rafatalia and enters Inquisition Mode, but I use her slave seal to stop her.<br/>
"Mu…." (Firo)<br/>
Firo tries to raise a complaint, but I keep her quiet.<br/>
If things go wrong here, Rishia will develop a mental trauma.<br/>
Her mental breakdown flag has been raised for a while, but I don’t want it to go off now.<br/>
After Itsuki… is able to collect himself some more, I can let Rishia deal with him.<br/>
I’m a little hesitant letting them meet. For moral reasons.<br/>
Rishia seems to hold a fantasy-like image of Itsuki.<br/>
I think their personalities will prevent them from making up.<br/>
That won’t help Rishia’s motivation at all.<br/>
But I guess I’ll at least ask.<br/>
"Rishia." (Naofumi)<br/>
"What is it?" (Rishia)<br/>
"You want to become strong so that Itsuki recognizes you, correct?" (Naofumi)<br/>
"Yes." (Rishia)<br/>
"Then you’ll still work to become stronger from here on out?" (Naofumi)<br/>
"Yes. I still have a long way to go. I want to get strong enough to fight alongside Itsuki-sama." (Rishia)<br/>
And that’s why I can’t let them meet now.<br/>
For Itsuki’s sake and for Rishia’s sake.<br/>
Though I only really care about the latter.<br/>
If they meet now, both of them will only suffer.<br/>
And so we all keep silent and turn our backs to Rishia.<br/>
We load the new slaves onto the carriage, and prepare set off.<br/>
There are now three carriages connected to Firo.<br/>
And she is having more fun than ever.<br/>
The Slave Dealer apparently has business in Zeltburg, so he stayed behind.<br/>
There’s no need for us to return together. He seems to have taken a strange liking to me, but I don’t really enjoy his company.<br/>
I look at the slaves on the carriage I’m in. It’s quite cramped.<br/>
We’ve split them between the carriages to make the trip easier, but Sadina is too big… just her alone takes up much of the carriage’s space.<br/>
"Hey, you’re too big. Could you possibly get there alone by sea?" (Naofumi)<br/>
"Naofumi-sama!?" (Rafatalia)<br/>
Rafatalia seems mad.<br/>
Her reaction is justified, however Sadina really is in the way.<br/>
She’s too big to fit in a carriage. I could send her by foot, but would she be able to keep up with Firo’s legs?<br/>
That’s not possible.<br/>
Is having her go by sea that cruel?<br/>
"That sounds good!" (Sadina)<br/>
And Sadina happily accepts my proposal.<br/>
I was half-joking, you know.<br/>
"Really?" (Naofumi)<br/>
"It’s much easier than walking on land, and if I use underwater currents, it will also be faster." (Sadina)<br/>
"Will you be able to deal with sea monsters on your own?" (Naofumi)<br/>
"Don’t underestimate me." (Sadina)<br/>
I think her level was… in the 40s.<br/>
Even with a discount, she was quite expensive.<br/>
"Understood, then I’ll leave it to you." (Naofumi)<br/>
"Yes. I can’t wait to see everyone." (Sadina)<br/>
She says as she jumps into a river by herself.<br/>
Zeltburg is close to the ocean, she’ll probably make it just fine.<br/>
"Sadina Neechan is really strong, you know." (Rafatalia)<br/>
Rafatalia seems proud of the village slaves we found this time.<br/>
It doesn’t seem Sadina had as many signs of abuse as the others.<br/>
"Oneechan helped protect us." (Rafatalia)<br/>
"Hmm…" (Naofumi)<br/>
Is it because she was older?<br/>
Her stats aren’t particularly high, but I guess she is skillful.<br/>
The village’s children probably relied on her quite a bit.<br/>
"…I see." (Fohl)<br/>
Fohl watches Sadina as she disappears into the water.<br/>
Can he sense her will?<br/>
He places a jug of water next to Atlas, who is lying on the floor.<br/>
"Thank you, Ani-sama." (Atlas)<br/>
"Don’t worry about it. Is your health getting any better?" (Fohl)<br/>
"Yes… Most of the pain is gone." (Atlas)<br/>
"That’s good." (Fohl)<br/>
"Naofumi-sama… when will we leave?" (Atlas)<br/>
(TL: Note, everyone pronounces Naofumi’s name phonetically, but Atlas says it with the Kanji)<br/>
Atlas directs a question towards me.<br/>
She can’t see, so I’m a little concerned.<br/>
"Yeah, we’ll depart soon." (Naofumi)<br/>
"Understood." (Atlas)<br/>
"I think it’s best if you took some more medicine." (Naofumi)<br/>
I change my shield to the Sacred Tree Shield, and hand all of the Yggdrasil medicine I have left to Atlas.<br/>
Perhaps it will improve her condition further.<br/>
"Thank you…" (Atlas)<br/>
"Don’t worry about it." (Naofumi)<br/>
I direct a condescending glare at Fohl.<br/>
"Gununu…" (Fohl) (TL: Grumbling sound)<br/>
He seems conflicted.<br/>
Well, I’ll have him work hard to pay off the medicine costs.<br/>
It was expensive, so he better be prepared for hell.<br/>
"Naofumi-sama…" (Atlas)<br/>
Atlas grasps my hand.<br/>
"Please get along with my brother." (Atlas)<br/>
"We’re not fighting! Right?" (Fohl)<br/>
Fohl approaches me amiably and puts his arm around my shoulders.<br/>
What’s with his feigned friendliness?<br/>
If you think we’re friends, you’re wrong.<br/>
"You too, Onii-sama. Get along with this nice person." (Atlas)<br/>
"I-I know!" (Fohl)<br/>
"That’s good." (Atlas)<br/>
Atlas seems tired.<br/>
Even though the medicine is working, she’s still sick.<br/>
"I’m getting a little tired." (Atlas)<br/>
"Then rest. Our village is a bit far… And our carriage’s bird is a terrible driver. It’s best to rest now." (Naofumi)<br/>
"Your carriage’s bird? She must be… that person with a strong aura like Naofumi-sama." (Atlas)<br/>
Atlas points in Firo’s direction.<br/>
Though she’s blind, it seems she can sense some things.<br/>
"What’s up master?" (Firo)<br/>
"Ah, our new slave, Atlas, is blind, but she could tell that you were strong." (Naofumi)<br/>
"Ehehe, Firo has been praised." (Firo)<br/>
"That person… is very energetic and… has a lot of innocence. I can tell that she has been raised by Naofumi-sama’s kindness." (Atlas)<br/>
"Yeah!" (Firo)<br/>
Firo puffs up her chest and answers.<br/>
Kindness? When have I ever been kind to anyone? What is this person saying?<br/>
I’ll ignore it.<br/>
"Anyways, we have a sick patient here, so sudden accelerations are banned." (Naofumi)<br/>
"Yes~" (Firo)<br/>
"And Atlas, if you’re sleepy then go to sleep. Let Fohl endure the ride by himself." (Naofumi)<br/>
"…ah." (Atlas)<br/>
Fohl glares at me with rebellious eyes. It’s of no concern to me.<br/>
The coupling of the carriages is complete. We leave Zeltburg in the darkness of the night.<br/>
