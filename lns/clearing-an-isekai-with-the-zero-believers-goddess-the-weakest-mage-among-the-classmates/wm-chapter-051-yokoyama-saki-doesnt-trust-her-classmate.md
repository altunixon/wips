<br/>
-Yokoyama Saki POV- <br/>
"Sakurai-kun, want me to help?" (Makoto)<br/>
It was only after a while that I noticed that the feeble-looking mage together with Aya-chan was our classmate Takatsuki-kun.<br/>
I -Yokoyama Saki- have the skill: Holy Knight.<br/>
I use a holy sword, and with my body clad in light aura, I don’t get injured a single bit by weak monsters.<br/>
With that power, I play an active role as the aide of the Light Hero.<br/>
Also, my other skill: [Mana Vision].<br/>
I can see the source of power in this world that is called Mana.<br/>
Thanks to that, we managed to overcome many dangers.<br/>
Monsters that feign to be weak, assassins that feign to be civilians.<br/>
Even if they try to hide their appearance, they can’t hide their mana.<br/>
In my eyes…Takatsuki-kun is weak.<br/>
I feel like he hasn’t gotten any stronger at all since the time I saw him at the temple.<br/>
He has mana that is lower than that of the regular citizen.<br/>
There’s no doubt he has been slacking in his training too.<br/>
Even at school, he would always be playing games instead of studying.<br/>
Even though Ryosuke is facing so much hardships because he ended up obtaining incredible power…<br/>
What is this guy, who hasn’t worked hard at all and was just playing around, going to help us out in?! <br/>
I say this to him with slight ire.<br/>
"Takatsuki-kun, there’s nothing you can help u—" (Yokoyama)<br/>
"Do you have a good plan?" (Sakurai)<br/>
Ryousuke cuts my words and asks Takatsuki-kun.<br/>
Eh?<br/>
Are you going to rely on him?<br/>
"A bit. I won’t know until I try though." (Makoto)<br/>
"We don’t have any moves we can make anymore. Please do help us out." (Sakurai)<br/>
Eeh…? I am sure it will be pointless.<br/>
Ah, but maybe he will ask the red haired mage companion of Takatsuki-kun.<br/>
Her mana is overwhelming.<br/>
It is on a level that you can’t find even in the royal mages.<br/>
"Then, wait here, Lucy, Nina-san. Sa-san, can you guide us?" (Makoto)<br/>
"Got it." (Aya)<br/>
Looks like only Aya-chan will be coming with us.<br/>
My prediction was wrong.<br/>
"Will you be okay, Takatsuki-sama?" (Nina)<br/>
"Be careful out there, Makoto." (Lucy)<br/>
His two companions seem to be worried.<br/>
Of course they are.<br/>
He is weak after all.<br/>
"I won’t be that reckless." (Makoto)<br/>
Takatsuki-kun says this lightheartedly.<br/>
He doesn’t understand the fearsomeness of the enemy.<br/>
When you see the Taboo Dragon, you will definitely fall down on your butt.<br/>
The ones heading there were Ryousuke, Aya-chan, Takatsuki-kun, and I.<br/>
In the first place, can Takatsuki-kun and Aya-chan use flying magic?<br/>
◇◇<br/>
Takatsuki-kun didn’t use flying magic.<br/>
Instead, he used a weird spell that let him move on the water surface.<br/>
Even though flying magic is something that any Intermediate Rank Mage can use.<br/>
"Waah, it is faster than the Sea Serpent." (Aya)<br/>
Aya-chan is merry.<br/>
It looks kinda fun.<br/>
◇◇<br/>
"Is this the place, Sa-san?" (Makoto)<br/>
"Yeah, from here on is the Low Floor. They told me to never go down." (Aya)<br/>
Aya-chan and Takatsuki-kun are speaking.<br/>
She seems to be pretty familiar with the dungeon. <br/>
Is she an adventurer?<br/>
We are currently standing on a small island at a corner of the underground lake.<br/>
A bit ahead of the small island, at the bottom of the lake, I could see a giant underwater cave.<br/>
The Mid Floor is lit by water stones, so it makes for a wondrous sight, but the cave itself is pitch black.<br/>
"There’s Taboo Dragons on the other side of this submerged cave. But the members of the knight order are not good in underwater battles…" (Sakurai)<br/>
Ryousuke says this with regret.<br/>
But everyone did their best -for a group that’s composed mostly of new recruit knights.<br/>
The ones at fault are the Prince Faction that are getting in the way of the support, and that Great Sage that’s not helping out at all.<br/>
Thanks to that, we ended up having to rely on an apprentice mage like Takatsuki-kun…<br/>
"So, think you could do something?" (Sakurai)<br/>
Ryousuke, even if you have hopes, I don’t think it is possible…<br/>
"If the Taboo Dragons were not underwater, but brought out to the outside, would it be easier to fight?" (Makoto)<br/>
"Can you do that?! If it is outside the dungeon, I can push my Light Hero Skill to full use. If there’s the light of the sun, I can definitely win." (Sakurai)<br/>
"Alright. Then, I will drag the enemy outside the water." (Makoto)<br/>
Takatsuki-kun says this as if nothing.<br/>
(There’s no way he can do that…) (Yokoyama)<br/>
"Wait a bit. I will speak to the Spirits. There seems to be a whole lot around this area." (Makoto)<br/>
"Takatsuki-kun, you can see Spirits? That’s amazing." (Sakurai)<br/>
See Spirits?<br/>
Even though I with Mana Vision can’t see them?<br/>
Saying whatever he sees fit!<br/>
The gullible Ryousuke seems to believe him though.<br/>
In the first place, I haven’t seen Spirit Users even in the Highland Kingdom.<br/>
"Ooi, Spirit-sans. You doing good?" (Makoto)<br/>
What’s that?<br/>
Are you telling me something like that will get the Spirits to help us?<br/>
"Yeah, the enemy is a bit difficult, you see… Yeah, we are troubled." (Makoto)<br/>
(We are the ones troubled.) (Yokoyama)<br/>
"Thanks, you are a great help." (Makoto)<br/>
(Haah, how long will this pointless conversation…) (Yokoyama)<br/>
"Then, I will be counting on you." (Makoto)<br/>
Right after Takatsuki-kun said this…<br/>
—The world tilted.<br/>
That’s the kind of optical illusion I had.<br/>
"?!" <br/>
The whole Laberintos is trembling.<br/>
Even though there’s no way that’s possible.<br/>
I can’t breathe.<br/>
What? What’s going on?<br/>
"Saki-chan, what’s the matter?" (Aya)<br/>
Aya-chan speaks to me, but I was panicking.<br/>
My vision turned pure white, and I couldn’t see anything.<br/>
The moment I noticed all of that was mana, my spine froze.<br/>
(What’s this?! Everything is mana? This is bad, it is not being controlled at all! It is rampaging!) (Yokoyama)<br/>
"…How overwhelming. This is the power of Spirits?" (Sakurai)<br/>
Ryousuke must be feeling this crazed mana! <br/>
We have to stop this quickly.<br/>
"Yeah, this is the first time I’ve had these many Spirits come." (Makoto)<br/>
Takatsuki-kun still has that feeble mana.<br/>
He was at the center of that raging typhoon-like mana.<br/>
He may be a bad excuse of a mage, but there’s no way he isn’t being overwhelmed by this mana, and yet…!<br/>
(Only the mana at the surroundings of Takatsuki-kun are calming down…?) (Yokoyama)<br/>
It was like the eye of the tornado.<br/>
As if saying he is the center of the world.<br/>
"Now, I will be using magic. It is hard to control, so move back." (Makoto)<br/>
What is he saying?! <br/>
There’s no way a human can control this mana! <br/>
"Saki, let’s leave this to Takatsuki-kun." (Sakurai)<br/>
The eyes of Ryousuke were from expectation and trust.<br/>
Why?! <br/>
He hasn’t shown those kinds of eyes to anyone before.<br/>
"And me?" (Aya)<br/>
"Hmm, stay close to Sakurai-kun too, Sa-san." (Makoto)<br/>
"Eeh, I want to look at Takatsuki-kun’s magic from up-close." (Aya)<br/>
What are you saying?! <br/>
Get away from him, Aya-chan! <br/>
We 3 move back, and watch over him.<br/>
"Then, I will be counting on you, Spirit-sans. [Water Magic: Yamata no Orochi]." (Makoto)<br/>
—At that instant, a monster was born.<br/>
