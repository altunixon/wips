Chapter 176: Wimp<br/>
"And so Rafatalia’s proposed Atlas countermeasure is you?" (Naofumi)<br/>
"Yes, I am also quite troubled." (Sadina)<br/>
Sadina answers while pouring herseld a glass of sake in my room.<br/>
Why was she even chosen?<br/>
"Well, just leave it to this Onee-san." (Sadina)<br/>
"That’s just making me more anxious." (Naofumi)<br/>
Sadina had a fast growth rate, and she is already level 35.<br/>
She hunts alone.<br/>
I wonder how strong the sea monsters she fights are.<br/>
Should I send the other slaves ocean monster hunting? I could build boats, and…<br/>
"And, what exactly should I do? Should I act like I’m having a good time with Naofumi-chan in front of Atlas-chan?" (Sadina)<br/>
"That sounds idiotic. What do you mean by, ‘a good time’." (Naofumi)<br/>
She’s avoiding directly saying anything indecent, but Sadina is slowly taking off her loincloth.<br/>
Who wants to have a good time with you!? Please limit your jokes.<br/>
Rafatalia, your choice of personnel is wrong.<br/>
"If it’s with Naofumi-chan, I think I can have a good time." (Sadina)<br/>
"Listen to people when they’re talking to you." (Naofumi)<br/>
"Hm? What sort of good time did you have in mind? I wanted to invite you to drink sake with me." (Sadina)<br/>
"*Sigh*…" (Naofumi)<br/>
My head hurts. And I haven’t even drunken anything.<br/>
So she was adjusting the cloth as not to spill anything on it.<br/>
I’m supposed to be past an age where I get flustered by something like that.<br/>
"Anyways, stop calling me Naofumi-chan." (Naofumi)<br/>
"Isn’t it fine?" (Sadina)<br/>
"No, it’s not. That’s why I’m telling you." (Naofumi)<br/>
Why am I spending my night under the same roof as this one? Dealing with people like this tires me out.<br/>
This is all Atlas’s fault.<br/>
"Don’t be so stiff. Gaelion-chan is also helping keep watch." (Sadina)<br/>
"KYUA!" (Gaelion)<br/>
Just in case, we also have Gaelion standing on watch.<br/>
He’s too big to fit through the door.<br/>
But we somehow managed to squeeze him in.<br/>
Gaelion has curled up in a corner of the room.<br/>
He occasionally wanders around looking at the objects in my room with curiosity.<br/>
"Sleeping with Gaelion-chan feels quite high-class." (Sadina)<br/>
"That’s all you’re thinking of?" (Naofumi)<br/>
This person… I’m not going to become her toy.<br/>
"Do you have any intention of answering Atlas-chan’s feeling?" (Sadina)<br/>
"Feelings? That person is a child. Rafatalia is the same. My relationship with them is like father and child." (Naofumi)<br/>
They didn’t have anyone to look out for them, and suddenly I took up that role for them.<br/>
Even if they may mistake that emotion for love, it’s more like the love they will have for their family.<br/>
And as an elder, I cannot approach them based on those vague emotions.<br/>
That’s something that comes after they mature mentally.<br/>
And even if they mature, we are in a situation where anyone could die in battle at any moment.<br/>
I only bought Rafatalia because she was the same Gender as Witch. I don’t have the right to be like that with her.<br/>
The same goes for Atlas.<br/>
"I’m a coward, you know. I’m building a place that may take them to their deaths here." (Naofumi)<br/>
"And that’s Naofumi-chan’s reason?" (Sadina)<br/>
Sadina stares at me with serious eyes.<br/>
"Naofumi-chan sure does treasure everyone." (Sadina)<br/>
"Did you hear what I just said? I’m nothing but a coward." (Naofumi)<br/>
"I’ll leave it at that. But if you get really close to Rafatalia-chan, you better be prepared for stuff like that." (Sadina)<br/>
"What are you even talking about?" (Naofumi)<br/>
I think the Sake is getting to her.<br/>
After talking for a while, she lies on the bed, and turns her back to the door.<br/>
"Um." (Atlas)<br/>
What the hell are you doing? Before I can say that, Atlas quickly opens the door and enters the room.<br/>
"Oh my, Naofumi-chan is quite bold~." (Sadina)<br/>
"Who is being b-!?" (Naofumi)<br/>
She lifts up the covers and pulls me in, interrupting my sentence.<br/>
What is this? W-wait!<br/>
"Ara, Atlas-chan? Naofumi-chan is currently doing something fun with this Onee-chan, so please come back later." (Sadina)<br/>
Don’t screw with me.<br/>
I don’t want to get into a situation that could cause such misunderstandings.<br/>
Her large body is trying to crush me.<br/>
But, don’t forget that I am the Hero of the Shield.<br/>
Something of this weight feels like nothing.<br/>
"KYUA!" (Gaelion)<br/>
For some reason, even Gaelion climbs into the bed.<br/>
"I really don’t get that feeling…" (Atlas)<br/>
"Ara? You saw through it. Oh well. ‘Twas a Failure." (Sadina)<br/>
"What do you mean failure!?" (Naofumi)<br/>
Was this Sadina’s supposed Atlas Countermeasure?<br/>
She can’t see, so if she doesn’t feel that sort of presence, Atlas won’t be fooled.<br/>
And even if it succeeded, my standings in the village would be crushed. Everyone would look at me like a pervert.<br/>
What sort of situation would have me in this position with Sadina.<br/>
"Quit it!" (Naofumi)<br/>
"Then onto stage 2. Gaelion-chan." (Sadina)<br/>
"KYUA!" (Gaelion)<br/>
"Go try to have a fun time with Atlas." (Sadina)<br/>
"That’s definitely impossible. Give it up." (Naofumi)<br/>
Stage 2…!?<br/>
Are these people even serious?<br/>
"Naofumi-sama and Sadina-san sure get along well." (Atlas)<br/>
Atlas ignores us and enters the house.<br/>
Don’t enter my house without permission!<br/>
"Now then, Atlas-chan. You understand why I’m here, right?" (Sadina)<br/>
"…Yes." (Atlas)<br/>
"You’re quick minded. Atlas-chan is quite a good girl, but please leave these sorts of things for when you become an adult." (Sadina)<br/>
"I can’t." (Atlas)<br/>
"T-this Onee-san doesn’t like kids who don’t listen." (Sadina)<br/>
"I yearn for Naofumi-sama. I just want to get a little closer to him." (Atlas)<br/>
"Arara… This is quite serious." (Sadina)<br/>
Sadina seems to have given up.<br/>
So Rafatalia’s countermeasures only go this far.<br/>
"Naofumi-chan, won’t you have a fun time with Atlas-chan?" (Sadina)<br/>
"Hell no!" (Naofumi)<br/>
"Then there’s no helping it." (Sadina)<br/>
Sadina puts her hand on Atlas’s shoulder.<br/>
"Atlas-chan, Naofumi-chan is a wimp, so he can’t bring himself to devour women." (Sadina)<br/>
"Wimp? Oy!" (Naofumi)<br/>
Somehow the situation has headed in this direction!<br/>
"It’s alright. Naofumi-sama is someone who does things when the time is right." (Atlas)<br/>
Atlas seems to have developed a strange trust in me!<br/>
This is a pain! I want to run away.<br/>
Does this girl even know what she’s saying?<br/>
"Your resolve is unwavering. Atlas-chan, me and Naofumi-chan are concerned about your age." (Sadina)<br/>
"My… age?" (Atlas)<br/>
"Yeah, Atlas-chan is still a child. You’ve just gotten over your illness, so please grow up healthily. And if you still love Naofumi-chan at that point… Naofumi-chan will consider it as well." (Sadina)<br/>
"I see…" (Atlas)<br/>
Atlas seems troubled. She tilts her head as she answers.<br/>
Nice follow-up.<br/>
Because she’s a child, tell her ‘After you grow up, we’ll get married.’<br/>
Since I was raised in Otaku culture, I know the phrase works.<br/>
It will bring some problems down the road, but I don’t plan to stay in this world for too long. So I don’t have to deal with it.<br/>
Yeah, let’s go with this.<br/>
…Wait. Isn’t this the train of thought of a wimp?<br/>
Let’s not think too hard about it.<br/>
"It’s still too early for you." (Sadina)<br/>
"But I heard that he sleeps with Rafatalia-chan." (Atlas)<br/>
"Not that ‘sleep with’. We just sleep in the same house. The only one who sometimes climbs into my bed is Firo." (Naofumi)<br/>
"Then, without any deeper meaning, please let me sleep in the same bed as you." (Atlas)<br/>
It was no good. Words aren’t getting through.<br/>
No it seems that they are, but her will is unchanged.<br/>
"And this is a place where I may die tomorrow. If I have to wait to adulthood, it may be too late." (Atlas)<br/>
…So she realized it.<br/>
In this world, you don’t know when and where you might die.<br/>
And the people of my village are eventually going to combat the wave.<br/>
It goes without saying that the people here may die.<br/>
But this is a child whose illness could have taken her at any time.<br/>
She must live treasuring very day.<br/>
"I can’t live relying on my brother forever. I want to properly marry someone." (Atlas)<br/>
"… And that someone is Naofumi-chan." (Sadina)<br/>
"Yes, I can’t consider anyone other than Naofumi-sama." (Atlas)<br/>
"Then it would be best for you to understand his feelings more." (Sadina)<br/>
"Naofumi-sama’s feelings?" (Atlas)<br/>
"Right. Naofumi-chan is considering Atlas-chan and everyone else. It’s not like he has no special feelings for you, but there is something more important than that. Do you understand?" (Sadina)<br/>
"… Yes." (Atlas)<br/>
Atlas answers after a long silence.<br/>
Sadina is quite good with words.<br/>
Is she just good with dealing with children?<br/>
I should caution myself not to get swept up into her pace.<br/>
"From Naofumi-chan’s point of view, Atlas-chan is a precious villager. Everyone in this village is like family to him. Even his closest Rafatalia understands this." (Sadina)<br/>
Though I believe that Rafatalia is quite diligent, and uninterested in love.<br/>
But if I bring that up here, I will get into trouble, so I’ll keep quiet.<br/>
"So don’t try to be selfish or Naofumi-chan will get mad. Please wait for the right opportunity to get him." (Sadina)<br/>
"I understand." (Atlas)<br/>
Sadina points at me… For some reason her index finger and middle finger are curled with her thumb in-between them.<br/>
In my world, that sign is quite dangerous.<br/>
I wonder what it means in this one.<br/>
It seems Sadina is using it in the way I know.<br/>
"Then I’ll sleep in his room waiting for the opportunity." (Atlas)<br/>
"Nothing Changed!" (Naofumi)<br/>
"KYUA!" (Gaelion)<br/>
What am I supposed to do.<br/>
"There’s no helping it. This Onee-chan will sleep with you. Don’t go crawling into Naofumi-chan’s bed." (Sadina)<br/>
"Got it." (Atlas)<br/>
For now… Does she understand?<br/>
I don’t feel any safer.<br/>
Atlas lies down on Rafatalia’s bed.<br/>
"Sadina-san, before we sleep can you tell me a story?" (Atlas)<br/>
"Let’s see, then will one about the ocean be fine?" (Sadina)<br/>
Sadina soothes Atlas and begins speaking.<br/>
She’s a strange person, but she seems to be nice.<br/>
She’s trusted by the villagers, though I don’t get what they see in her. She’s become about as trusted as me.<br/>
They rely on her more than Rafatalia.<br/>
She also seems to be good with children. If she doesn’t mess around, there are a few jobs I want her to do.<br/>
"KYUA!" (Gaelion)<br/>
Gaelion was listening to Sadina’s story, but he soon got bored and began snooping around the room.<br/>
He sticks his head into the sack I keep the materials used to make new clothes and weapons.<br/>
"Hey, don’t tamper with that." (Naofumi)<br/>
Gaelion is quite a curious one. He’s also easy to deal with. Firo was also like this once.<br/>
Is what… I thought.<br/>
But I never thought this would be the trigger for that big incident.<br/>
