<br/>
Good news, I’m now a senior in the second semester, meaning I’m a lame duck student. I can devote more time to translation… Oh, and since people ask how I find time for this let me say that my average time is 2 Hours +-30 minutes per chapter. it isn’t that bad.<br/>
Chapter 231: Miscalculations<br/>
Sparks fly as Kiel’s claws brush lightly against my shield.<br/>
Though she can’t overcome my Defense, it doesn’t feel good to intercept the momentum from a full-body attack.<br/>
All of the attacking slave’s attacks seem to be centered on me.<br/>
I’ve narrowly managed to block everything without taking damage, but I wonder how much longer I can keep this up.<br/>
As I receive attacks, I feel the curse afflicting them dealing additional damage to me.<br/>
It feels like my internal organs are twisting around each other. I feel dizzy.<br/>
Damn. At this rate, my body isn’t going to hold up.<br/>
"All is in the name of Justice. Niichan must be defeated!" (Kiel)<br/>
"Kiel… you better remember this later. Even if you were brainwashed, that doesn’t mean I’m lessening your punishment for this at all." (Naofumi)<br/>
… This justice crap is getting annoying!<br/>
Aren’t they getting something wrong here?<br/>
I’m no saint. I’m no philanthropist.<br/>
Of course I would use all of you people.<br/>
I mean, aren’t I always saying it?<br/>
‘Get back to work,’ and such.<br/>
No, the normal Kiel should be well aware of that.<br/>
I should think of the person in front of me as a separate entity controlling Kiel’s body.<br/>
What should I do? Should I use Wrath and turn everything to ash?<br/>
"You’re wrong! Naofumi-san is… definitely not evil!" (Rishia)<br/>
Rishia cautions Kiel with a strong tone of voice.<br/>
What?<br/>
I didn’t know she could speak with such a tone.<br/>
"Naofumi-chan, should this Onee-san do something radical to gain control of the situation?" (Sadina)<br/>
"What do you plan on doing?" (Naofumi)<br/>
Ah, by the way, Sadina is level 75. Her stats are also quite high.<br/>
Honestly, if you don’t count Raphtalia and Firo, her stats are some of the highest I’ve seen. They’re higher than Kiel’s.<br/>
Her weak points are Speed and Attack Range.<br/>
But, when in the water, these weaknesses disappear.<br/>
"Just… a little." (Sadina)<br/>
"… I asked what you were going to do." (Naofumi)<br/>
"Let’s see. The result of this plan will probably make you forgive Kiel and the others." (Sadina)<br/>
"Oi! You couldn’t be…" (Naofumi)<br/>
"I who has understood the source of power command. Let the truth once again manifest itself. Oh lightning, shoot down all that stand before me! All Dreifach Chain Lightning!"<br/>
From the tip of Sadina’s harpoon, several streams of lightning bright enough to cause permanent eye damage shoot out towards the brainwashed children.<br/>
"GYAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA" (Children)<br/>
Kiel and the others fall to the ground.<br/>
The lightning continues for a while. I smell the scent of burnt hair.<br/>
"Sadina, you…" (Naofumi)<br/>
"It’s alright. I controlled the output. If I was serious, it would look even more amazing." (Sadina)<br/>
I see. (TL: Naofumi uses sarcastic slang here)<br/>
"Is everyone alive?" (Naofumi)<br/>
"We’re fine, but some people are beginning to spout words similar to Kiel-kun." (Rishia)<br/>
Ah, so they awakened to the wonderful world of Justice.<br/>
Is this some sort of religious cult?<br/>
… The situation is quite unfavorable.<br/>
"Brother of the Shield, prepare yourself!" (Slave) (TL: This is not Kiel)<br/>
So there were still some hiding around.<br/>
More of the missing children begin pouring into the village.<br/>
Dammit… They’re putting my subordinates to good use.<br/>
They’re definitely cutting their losses here.<br/>
Even if Itsuki was consumed by his curse, I doubt he would have enough power to beat me and my subordinates head on in battle.<br/>
But, the people standing before me are those I personally raised and gave stat growth increases to.<br/>
These children are already leagues above the average knights and adventurers.<br/>
And for many of them, like Raphtalia, this is their homeland.<br/>
Normally, this would be a group that even entire countries would hesitate to challenge.<br/>
I have to congratulate him for the brilliance of his idea, but it’s quite inhumane.<br/>
He probably lured out the weakest of slaves, brainwashed them, sent them back, and had them bring their friends. In the end, everyone would happily try to kill me.<br/>
He probably spent a long time planning this.<br/>
Ah… This really is hitting below the belt.<br/>
Among the seven sins, I wonder which one would grant such an ability.<br/>
"Is this all of the slaves that went missing?" (Naofumi)<br/>
"No… I think it’s less than half." (Rishia)<br/>
As I thought.<br/>
Honestly, if he suddenly gained such an amazing fighting force, he would start off by spreading it out.<br/>
Also…<br/>
"That carriage is…" (Naofumi)<br/>
The slaves were carried off towards it, but the battle’s been going on for a while, and I’ve seen no activity from it. Is Itsuki there?<br/>
Did he miss his chance to make a dramatic entrance?<br/>
I wonder. Something seems fundamentally wrong here. I have a bad feeling about this.<br/>
"How long do you think Kiel’s group will be knocked out for?" (Naofumi)<br/>
"You shouldn’t expect too much. Kiel-chan’s become quite strong." (Sadina)<br/>
"Then we’d better investigate that carriage while we can. We may find the source." (Naofumi)<br/>
"Naofumi-san…" (Rishia)<br/>
"What is it, Rishia?" (Naofumi)<br/>
"…" (Rishia)<br/>
Is she going to ask me to spare Itsuki?<br/>
Female Knight did something like that as well.<br/>
Well it depends on the situation. If I find a way to free Itsuki of his curse, I may be able to use him later.<br/>
And from his ability to cause such chaos, I think the boy will be quite useful.<br/>
At least in battle.<br/>
I wait for Rishia’s question, but it doesn’t come.<br/>
"If you’ve got nothing to say, then we’re heading out." (Naofumi)<br/>
"… Okay." (Rishia)<br/>
I guess she’s dealing with many conflicted emotions. I wonder what she’ll do when she meets Itsuki.<br/>
Anyways, I hope it doesn’t come to her betraying me.<br/>
That would really be a pain. I’ll have to use the slave seal to stop her then.<br/>
I open Rishia’s slave management screen just in case.<br/>
"Oi, whoever’s hiding in the carriage! Just get out already." (Naofumi)<br/>
I shout out as I approach it.<br/>
… Is there really no one there?<br/>
That can’t be. From Kiel and the others’ movements, there’s got to be something here.<br/>
"Oi!" (Naofumi)<br/>
This isn’t getting anywhere.<br/>
"Sadina, go cast your magic on that carriage." (Naofumi)<br/>
"Are you sure?" (Sadina)<br/>
"I gave enough warning. Use your full power on this one." (Naofumi)<br/>
"I guess there’s no helping it." (Sadina)<br/>
Sadina approves my proposal to attack the carriage.<br/>
"I who has understood the source of power command. Let the truth once again manifest itself. Rain down thunder on my enemies! Dreifach Thunderbolt!"<br/>
Thunder sounds out as a bolt of electricity strikes the carriage.<br/>
And a human figure quickly scrambles out just in the knick of time.<br/>
"What!?" (Naofumi)<br/>
I-it’s not Itsuki…<br/>
The figure held a cane in his hands and wore a long robe. On his head was a needlessly pointy hat. It was the stereotypical clothing of a mage you would find in a child’s story book.<br/>
The robe had intricate embroidery stretched over the trim, and the cane gave off an expensive feeling.<br/>
I can tell from a glance that the hat was also made of good materials.<br/>
But the thing that surprised me the most was the fact that the man was not Itsuki.<br/>
He was clearly a mage of some sort. I have the feeling that I’ve seen him somewhere before, but I can’t remember where.<br/>
And… he pulls out a dagger glowing with a strange light from the chest area of the robe.<br/>
"You bastard… Devil of the Shield! Treating your own subordinates and ours in such an inhumane manner." (Mage)<br/>
Who was this guy again?<br/>
I’m pretty sure I’ve seen him… somewhere.<br/>
He seems to know me, but… is he the guy Ren mentioned as being Witch’s companion?<br/>
That means that there’s a possibility I may have met him before.<br/>
I have some familiarity, but… It’s just not coming to me.<br/>
"Could it be…" (Rishia)<br/>
Rishia’s face becomes increasingly pale.<br/>
What? Do you know him?<br/>
As I thought about it, I remembered.<br/>
I’m pretty sure this guy was the mage in Itsuki’s party.<br/>
The time I spent with that party was short, but I think this guy may have been there.<br/>
I do feel a little guilty, but you can’t expect me to remember every little stupid detail.<br/>
The reason Ren didn’t remember clearly was because he went off and did Solo Play on Cal Mira. He probably only saw him for a few minutes.<br/>
I shouldn’t be criticizing him for it though. Besides Armor, I don’t remember any of them.<br/>
I mean, they all said pretty much the same things.<br/>
To put it bluntly, I don’t remember anyone from Itsuki’s party.<br/>
But… This is quite a miscalculation.<br/>
The contagious nature of the brainwashing was one thing, but Itsuki isn’t even here.<br/>
And the wound Imya’s uncle received was not by bow.<br/>
Kiel seemed to refer to more than one person when she spoke as well.<br/>
Did I think it was Itsuki due to the continued utterance of the word ‘Justice’?<br/>
No, there’s still a possibility he’s involved in this.<br/>
Okay, I’ll capture this guy and make him spill everything.<br/>
"Welst-san! Why are you in a place like this!?" (Rishia)<br/>
He had a name like that? First I’m hearing of it.<br/>
It’s not like I care or anything.<br/>
Among the other heroes’ companions, there are very few that I even remember.<br/>
And wasn’t Itsuki abandoned by his companions?<br/>
I assumed as such when I saw him acting independently, but I guess I should have investigated further.<br/>
Ren’s died, and Motoyasu’s ran away.<br/>
I see. So Itsuki’s companions survived.<br/>
Then, why was Itsuki mentally broken and fighting in Zeltburg?<br/>
"Why? That’s what I should be saying. Rishia, to think you would be conspiring with the Devil of the Shield… What could you be thinking?"<br/>
Nonono, the ones who drove Rishia out were you people.<br/>
You were there–you saw everything.<br/>
You can’t just conveniently forget that at this point in time.<br/>
