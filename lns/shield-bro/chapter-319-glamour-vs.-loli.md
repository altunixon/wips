Chapter 319: Glamour vs. Loli<br/>
The sun’s already set, but time is precious, so I ended up showing Trash my village’s situation… specifically the ones there that would make for good manpower.<br/>
For argument’s sake, he was with the Queen when we challenged Houou, so he should know, but I don’t think he has a definite grasp of my forces.<br/>
"Ah, Niichan." (Kiel)<br/>
We used Ren’s portal to return, and Kiel found us.<br/>
"Are you already okay?" (Kiel)<br/>
"Well, yeah. More importantly, have there been any problems on your side?" (Naofumi)<br/>
"None. By the way, I believe that person was the one who was always next to Queen-sama." (Kiel)<br/>
"Yeah." (Naofumi)<br/>
"This is the first time we’ve spoken. My name is known throughout the country, so I think you’ve at least heard it, though." (Trash)<br/>
"I think it was…" (Kiel)<br/>
Kiel hesitates in giving her answer.<br/>
I mean, when I changed his name, there was a national uproar.<br/>
It’s become a bit of a famous story.<br/>
"Hey, try saying my name." (Trash)<br/>
"Niichan, are you sure it’s alright?" (Kiel)<br/>
"The individual wishes for it, so go ahead." (Naofumi)<br/>
What sort of torture is this. Stop taking away our time.<br/>
Isn’t this kinda rude?<br/>
Did Trash act docile in order to accomplish this?<br/>
But the guy’s face is quite serious.<br/>
"Um… King-sama?" (Kiel)<br/>
"I’m Trash. Remember the name." (Trash)<br/>
"Um…" (Kiel)<br/>
"Don’t act so troubled!" (Naofumi)<br/>
IS he a masochist?<br/>
Do all the Heroes turn out like this?<br/>
"I also think this is harassment." (Ren)<br/>
No, it feels like the amount of Rens has merely multiplied.<br/>
But I don’t really feel like scolding him.<br/>
(TL: As in, Trash’s change was similar to Ren’s)<br/>
"I agree… Why did it turn out like this?" (Raphtalia)<br/>
Raphtalia’s carrying her head in her hands.<br/>
I think so as well, but Trash himself accepts the name, so there’s no helping it.<br/>
It was fun to use it to harass him, but when he says it with such a serious face, I’m the one that feels offended.<br/>
"What’s wrong, Iwatani-dono? Hurry and tell me your forces." (Trash)<br/>
If he were just acting, it would be fine, but the current Trash is being 100% genuine.<br/>
If you wonder why I understand this, it’s because my intuition has been sharpened from being in this world.<br/>
I’m especially good at seeing through merchants.<br/>
Anyways, my senses are telling me that Trash isn’t lying. His personality is just twisted.<br/>
But for him to force the Demi-Humans who he looked down upon to call him Trash…<br/>
If he tries pledging loyalty to me, then I won’t mind it, but I feel that’s not happening.<br/>
"Kiel, don’t think too hard about it… Just say it as if it’s a foreigner’s name." (Naofumi)<br/>
"Got it, Niichan. Good luck, Trash-san." (Kiel)<br/>
"Yes!" (Trash)<br/>
…<br/>
This Trash seems to be more enervating than ever before.<br/>
Motoyasu doesn’t listen to a word you say, so you can say anything. Trash listens to all arguments, and incorporates them into his own.<br/>
It’s dangerous to mess around with him.<br/>
"Then… come with me. Ren, go give an explanation to the villagers." (Naofumi)<br/>
"Understood." (Ren)<br/>
I bring Trash over to the place of the one I wanted to introduce him to.<br/>
"Ara? Marquis, are your wounds healed?"<br/>
"For the most part." (Naofumi)<br/>
I dragged Trash to Rat’s lab.<br/>
Inside of a large culture tank… something is floating.<br/>
It looks like a carriage.<br/>
"Where’s Mii-kun?" (Naofumi)<br/>
"In order to repair the body you made when you were out of it, he went off hunting." (Rat)<br/>
"Hunting?" (Naofumi)<br/>
"He spread out his body to cover everyone from Houou’s self-destruction, so much of it was blown away. In order to regenerate, he’ll have to supplement those lost parts." (Rat)<br/>
"… Supplement." (Naofumi)<br/>
"Fumu… I hypothesize that it’s something similar to the theory of how Slimes grow. Am I correct?" (Trash)<br/>
"Yes, correct. He’ll hunt monsters, and absorb their parts until he had enough matter to regenerate." (Rat)<br/>
I want to block my ears.<br/>
Just what sort of dangerous lifeform did I make!?<br/>
He seems likely to appear in some B Class Horror Film.<br/>
"Well, it’ll take a while for him to completely regrow. Restructuring the genetic construction of his prey is quite a difficult task." (Rat)<br/>
"Yes, yes, I get it… Rat, you understand the relation between the previous incident, and the war, right?" (Naofumi)<br/>
"Right… that Seven Star Hero in Faubley was the one who gave you those severe wounds, right?" (Rat)<br/>
"Was he the one who exiled you?" (Naofumi)<br/>
"Yes, with the support of my rival Alchemist. Out areas of study clashed, so it was quite a trial." (Rat)<br/>
I’ve heard something similar before.<br/>
I heard a lot that time, but I never thought they would become enemies.<br/>
But it’s beneficial for someone with information on the enemy to be an ally.<br/>
And it would be a poor move to ignore someone with skills similar to Rat.<br/>
"So there’s an alchemist there too?" (Naofumi)<br/>
"Yes. One with the appearance of a child." (Rat)<br/>
"Is he specialized in mechanics?" (Naofumi)<br/>
"No, that’s the Hero? Anyways, I thought she had died, but they managed to revive this country’s former princess, right? It’s definitely that girl’s work. She’s good at making Homunculus that imitate others. It’s difficult to tell them apart from the real thing." (Rat)<br/>
"I see." (Naofumi)<br/>
"From my perspective, she’s an exceedingly normal Alchemist. She’s a bit more knowledgeable on artificial life than most, but not on my level. Though I do happen to specialize in monsters." (Rat)<br/>
An alchemist with the body of a child, and an alchemist with the body of a slutty onee-san.<br/>
Now, legendary Hero, who will you choose?<br/>
And in the end, that Hero chose the Loli.<br/>
I do get the feeling that there were several little kids around him.<br/>
That man was a Lolicon… He;s a complete criminal.<br/>
No… I’m also a bit past that line.<br/>
Despite Raphtalia’s appearance, she’s a child in age.<br/>
And there’s also Atlas, so I can’t really complain about him.<br/>
"Did you not get along with her?" (Naofumi)<br/>
"If I were to choose, I’d have to say that the Hero drove me out because his research and mine contradicted one another. Airplanes, was it? I remember objecting to his ideas, and asking why he couldn’t just use Flying Beasts, or Gryphons." (Rat)<br/>
"I think there was also something called a ‘Tank’ on Faubley’s front line." (Trash)<br/>
"Hmm…" (Naofumi)<br/>
And Here, Rat has a similar Carriage-type Monster.<br/>
This monster should have some long distance magic capabilities.<br/>
Their research areas truly do overlap.<br/>
Here, we have lifeforms, and there, they have machines.<br/>
It’s uncertain how large of a gap this will create, but how about looking at it from Level?<br/>
The machines are based on the driver’s level. Their flaw is that if they get too damaged, they’ll have to be changed out.<br/>
With Monsters, you can simply cast healing magic on them, so prolonged fighting is possible.<br/>
For reasons such as this, Tact may have driven his theoretic rival out of Faubley.<br/>
"That woman always had a strange set of priorities. Even now, I find it irritating. She got smitten with that fool, and thus fell behind me in research!" (Rat)<br/>
Perhaps when Tact couldn’t get Rat to fall for him, he got rid of her.<br/>
Because for Rat, Mii-kun is the most important.<br/>
"This is?" (Naofumi)<br/>
I point at the caiirage-like thing inside of the tank.<br/>
"It’s something I set up before we set off to fight Houou. It’s the monster the Marquis designed. I tried to make it." (Rat)<br/>
"We’ll soon be drawn into war. Do you think you’ll make it?" (Naofumi)<br/>
"Just barely. I plan to have Mii-kun ride it as its core, we’ll probably have to go ahead without any practice, so I don’t really want to deploy it." (Rat)<br/>
That’s quite a bit of progress for a few days.<br/>
"I need to thank you for the versatility of the body you made." (Rat)<br/>
"So that’s it…" (Naofumi)<br/>
A function of the body that version of me made.<br/>
"I see. If we were able to use this in battle, it would decrease the danger of the plan." (Trash)<br/>
Trash nods to himself, as he begins asking Rat various questions.<br/>
"Can it take in magic from the outside, and release it similar to the theory of Ritual Magic?" (Trash)<br/>
"An interesting thought. I’ll test it out, but I ask you not to expect too much." (Rat)<br/>
On Trash’s proposition, Rat takes out a diagram.<br/>
I’ll have to pray that this will increase our forces however much it may…<br/>
"Rafu\~?" (Raph-chan)<br/>
Oh? Raph-chan found me, and ran over.<br/>
Why can I tell? His voice is the one most similar to Raphtalia’s.<br/>
Though it’’s a bit more childish.<br/>
I guess it’s like the voice of Raphtalia when I got her long ago.<br/>
"Ta\~li\~?" (Raph-chan)<br/>
He seems to be worried about my injuries.<br/>
"I’m fine. Don’t worry about it. You’re the one who set up the barrier magic, so I thank you." (Naofumi)<br/>
"Li\~ya!" (Raph-chan)<br/>
"… Naofumi-sama… please don’t play around too much." (Raphtalia)<br/>
As I began petting Raph-chan all over, Raphtalia cautions me with an embarrassed expression.<br/>
Her reaction is interesting, so I want to continue, but since Raphtalia’s saying it, I really should stop.<br/>
"Ah, right. Trash, This is one of the things I wanted to show you. Do you think you can use it?" (Naofumi)<br/>
"Yes, my wife told me it was a monster you created." (Trash)<br/>
"It’s called a Raph. When I was possessed by a cursed Shield, I created it as a completely new breed of monster." (Naofumi)<br/>
"I’ve seen it on the previous battlefield, There are a few variations of it, right?" (Trash)<br/>
"Yeah, the monsters of my village personally asked for modifications. They became new sorts of Raphs." (Naofumi)<br/>
"I see…" (Trash)<br/>
"Rafu\~?" (Raph-chan)<br/>
"He also wants to be used in battle. If you’re lacking manpower, go ahead and make use of them." (Naofumi)<br/>
Honestly, the levels of Melromark’s soldiers are low in comparison to Faubley’s.<br/>
In close quarters, they would be at quite a disadvantage.<br/>
Of course, I intend to take applicants from my village as well, but we definitely don’t have large enough numbers.<br/>
So I think it’s time to deploy a new kind of monster.<br/>
