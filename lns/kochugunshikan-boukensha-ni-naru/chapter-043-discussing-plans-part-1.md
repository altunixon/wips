Chapter 43 – Discussing Plans Part 1<br/>
We’ve finished discussing the bare outline of our future plans, so I gathered everyone inside Cleria and Elna’s room in order to iron out the details.<br/>
"After discussing things with Cleria, we have come to an agreement. We will now start our plan to create a new country."<br/>
""Ooh!""<br/>
The only ones who were surprised were Captain Dalshim, Baron Sergio, and Elna. Selena and Sharon weren’t surprised of course, since I’ve already discussed my plans with them last time.<br/>
"Wonderful! It seems that you have made your resolve, Your Highness!"<br/>
The place where we’ll found our new country is somewhere called the Great Demon Forest."<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
"By the Goddess! Alan-dono, that place is…"<br/>
"I am aware. However, there is no need for worry. Those under me have already started construction of a city that will be the country’s capital. It should be finished within one year."<br/>
"Oh! Such a thing–!"<br/>
"Once Alan and his cohorts have finished building the city, we shall move there and build up our strength."  <br/>
"I want to confirm this beforehand. Will the two thousand men under Cleria be willing to bring their families and loved ones to the new city once it is completed?"<br/>
"But of course! They have all been serving as vassals of the Earl for generations. There is no one who has inherited the blood of the Ludvic house more strongly than Cleria-sama."<br/>
"In the case that the city Alan builds ends up disadvantageous to the people, we have agreed not to go through with this plan. However, in the case that the city has no problems, we will immediately proceed with it with all haste."<br/>
"We are truly thankful for your consideration, Your Royal Highness."<br/>
"Let us assume that Alan’s city will have no problems then. Does anyone have any suggestions or clarifications regarding our plan to build a new country?"<br/>
"Alan-dono, I believe that the number of people who will move to the newly built city will amount to at least more than five thousand if we also include the vassal’s families. Will the accommodations of the new city suffice for all of them?"<br/>
(How about it, Iris?)<br/>
I had given Iris permission to monitor our current discussion earlier. <br/>
"There is no problem. I have designed the plans with plenty of leeway."<br/>
So we’ll really be able to build a base that can house more than five thousand people within one year huh? Well, I’ll just leave everything to Iris. Since Iris says it’s fine, then I’m sure it is.<br/>
"There’s no problem with that. We have designed the plans with plenty of leeway in mind."<br/>
"Hou. How wonderful! The number of subordinates under Alan-dono seems to be quite substantial. Just how many of them are there?" Captain Dalshim inquired.<br/>
Hm. How should I answer this one?<br/>
"Instead of subordinates, it would be more appropriate to call them subcontractors. I have placed an order for them to build a livable city, and so they shall. Once the city is finished, however, they will leave. We cannot count on them as part of our forces, unfortunately."<br/>
"I see. So that’s how it is…"<br/>
"In that case, one of our most pressing issues is how to increase the population of the new city. I think your earlier proposal of becoming a noble in some other country in order to gather citizens under your name sounds the most viable option for now." Cleria suggested.  <br/>
"…Whatever do you mean, Your Highness?"<br/>
"Alan said that he would have endeavored to become a noble of a country in order to gather citizens if he didn’t encounter us first. You planned to gather people, build up your strength, and then declare independence, did you not, Alan?" <br/>
"Well, something like that. It should be faster than gradually soliciting citizens, right?" <br/>
"Oh! I see. That might be a good hand. So you plan to steal a nation, so to speak. In our situation, we can no longer afford to be picky with the means we choose to achieve our goals.  We have to take back the Starveek Kingdom as soon as possible."<br/>
"Alan has promised that he shall give the Starveek Kingdom, that is now known as the Alois Kingdom, to me, as soon as he succeeds in taking it over, as long as that goal is accomplished within my lifetime." <br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
"Haha! Surely you jest!"<br/>
"I am not joking, Baron Sergio. This is only one of Alan’s promises to me. We will ultimately aim to conquer this entire continent, and unify it under one single banner."<br/>
"Hahaha!"<br/>
"Do you really think that sort of thing is possible, Alan-dono?"<br/>
"I am not thinking it would be accomplished easily. I am aware that unifying the continent will take quite a long time, but I also do not believe it to be impossible. No, I shall definitely accomplish it. Without fail."<br/>
"Now, now, Captain Dalshim. It is something our princess and Alan-dono, who is loved by the Goddess, set out to do. All we need to do is obey their wishes. And besides, one would need at least this much ambition in order to fulfill our goal of taking back our kingdom. How promising the two of them are!"<br/>
"Cleria-san, is the thing you talked about earlier really possible? About becoming a noble I mean." Sharon asked.<br/>
"It will not be easy. The Great Demon Forest is surrounded by an extensive mountain range, and the only countries that have access to it are the Cecilio Kingdom and the Belta Kingdom, where we currently are. In order to get promoted to nobility, one must build up fame and achievements in one of these two countries. Unfortunately, I am not that knowledgeable when it comes to the policies of these two countries when conferring peerage. Does anyone here have any idea?" <br/>
Nobody replied.<br/>
"Well, I don’t know about Cecilio Kingdom, but one of the owners of this inn, Verse, in addition to being a citizen of this country, was also a former A rank adventurer. He may have some idea. If not, then we can try asking Tarus-san. He’s quite well-informed, so there’s a good chance he knows something."<br/>
"That’s a good suggestion, Alan."<br/>
"In any case, our base will only be finished after one year. We do not have much to do before it gets finished, so I think the plan for becoming a noble is well worth a try at least."<br/>
"I’m sure it will be easy with your abilities, Alan. But your attitude of just trying it out is not advisable. If we are going to go ahead with this, then I hope you can do it with the resolve to accomplish it at all costs."<br/>
Whoah. Cleria’s really getting into it huh.<br/>
"You’re right. Sorry about that. I will definitely become a noble within one year. Hey, it’s not like I’d have to be the one to do it, though. You can also aim to be one yourself, right Cleria?"<br/>
"No. I’m a woman, so it will be difficult to be conferred a title through my achievements instead of inheritance. You are the most viable candidate, Alan."<br/>
"Is that the case? I’ll just have to do my utmost then."<br/>
We discussed various other things, and after we exhausted the topics everyone had in mind currently, we adjourned the meeting for the time being.  We decided to hold another meeting after dinner.<br/>
"Your Highness, can I borrow some of your time after this?"<br/>
"Of course, Baron Sergio."<br/>
It seems Cleria and her cohort have something to discuss among themselves. Well, since there was still some time before dinner, maybe I’ll mull things over a bit more in my room as well. <br/>
"Alan, we also have some things we want to talk to you about. Is it okay?" Selena chimed in.<br/>
"Of course it’s okay."<br/>
<br/>
 We decided to hold a separate meeting of our own in Selena and Sharon’s room. <br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
"Alan, we’ve already known about your intention to create a country, but is it really wise to make use of Cleria and the others to attain our objectives?"<br/>
"Hm? What do you mean?"<br/>
"Um, what I’m trying to say is that we might get used for their ends as well." Selena clarified.<br/>
"Well, I guess that’s practically what’s gonna happen. We will make use of Cleria and her group to achieve our goals, and they will also make use of our power to achieve theirs. We both have something to gain, and our goals basically align. That’s why I don’t really think there’s a problem with it."<br/>
"In other words, it will just end with that? We will cooperate with Cleria’s group in order to achieve the creation of a new country, but us, the imperial military, will still hold the initiative when it comes to governing the country?"<br/>
"Yes. But we won’t be holding complete authority over all matters. We will have full authority regarding setting the education policies of the new country as well as all matters regarding the planned unification of the continent, but will have to discuss with Cleria regarding other matters. In other words, it will be a co-rulership."<br/>
"I see. So that’s how it is." Sharon nodded.<br/>
"But it doesn’t change the fact that this is a great opportunity for us. Being able to gain more than five thousand new citizens all at once is something that will be hard to pass up. We cannot let go of this chance. I would like your full cooperation, you two."<br/>
"Roger that, Alan."<br/>
"Understood, Alan." <br/>
