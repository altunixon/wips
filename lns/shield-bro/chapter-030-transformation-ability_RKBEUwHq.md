It seems using emoticons is not to 4chan's liking...... apologies for being a newfag. <br/>
Anyways here is chapter 30. All dat Firo. <br/>

Transformation Ability <br/>
 <br/>
Naofumi:"Oyaji! Oyaji! Oyaji! Oyaji!" <br/>
(Tl note: Changed the rest of Oyaji to Old man, it would be a little weird spam old man 4 times.) <br/>
 <br/>
I constantly knocked on the door of the closed weapon shop. <br/>
The old man from the weapons shop opened the door with a slightly annoyed expression. <br/>
 <br/>
Old Man: "What does the lad of the shield want now? I closed the shop long ago." <br/>
Naofumi: "This situation is special!" <br/>
 <br/>
I show Firo who was wrapped in a mantle to him. <br/>
 <br/>
Old Man: "Lad, did you come here to boast about buying a good slave?" <br/>
Naofumi: "Of course not!" <br/>
 <br/>
What does this old man think of me!? <br/>
Though, when I met the old man, I could kill without hesitation. <br/>
 <br/>
Firo: "Master~? What's wrong?" <br/>
Naofumi: "You be quiet!" <br/>
Firo: "Noo-" <br/>
 <br/>
Shit! What the hell is going on!? <br/>
After that affair, the noise never stopped. <br/>
I'm surprised that the slave trader wanted to buy her off me while not listening to the complaints of his subordinates. <br/>
Even Raphtalia was speechless. <br/>
I told Firo that if she wants to stick to me, she needs to be in human form. <br/>
Thus, I carried Firo here to the weapons shop. <br/>
 <br/>
Firo: "Ah... Achoo!" <br/>
 <br/>
Bofun! Biriiiiii! <br/>
She transforms and all I heard was the sound of the mantle ripping. <br/>
In the blink of an eye, Firo reverts back to her Queen of the Philorial (Temporary) form. <br/>
This bird! That mantle wasn't free. <br/>
 <br/>
Old Man: "Hey..." <br/>
 <br/>
Even the old man is at a loss for words. I looked up at Firo. <br/>
Firo returned to her human form and holds my hand. <br/>
All that's left of the mantle rests on top of her head. <br/>
 <br/>
Naofumi: "Do you understand the circumstances now?" <br/>
Old Man: "Yeah..." <br/>
 <br/>
The old man guides us inside the store with a really complex expression. <br/>
 <br/>
Old Man: "So, the reason you came to see me is to get equipment for this child?" <br/>
Naofumi: "Are there any clothes that can transform with the user?" <br/>
 <br/>
I asked the old man for the unreasonable. <br/>
 <br/>
Naofumi: "Please make it transform!" <br/>
Old Man: "Lad, calm down a little." <br/>
 <br/>
Right, now that I think about it, why does Firo have a humanoid form? <br/>
She has wings growing from her back, blond hair, and fair blue eyes. Very angel-like. <br/>
Furthermore, her face is cute enough to be a lovely picture. <br/>
Her age looks around 10 and is about the same height as the old Raphtalia. <br/>
Guuuuuu.. <br/>
A very classic sound. <br/>
 <br/>
Firo: "Master~ I'm hungry." <br/>
Naofumi: "Endure it." <br/>
Firo: "Nooo-" <br/>
 <br/>
Damn! What am I supposed to do!? <br/>
 <br/>
Old Man: "Well, let's just have some dinner first." <br/>
 <br/>
The old man brings us to the back of the shop and takes out a pot full of something. It's soup. <br/>
 <br/>
Naofumi: "Sto-" <br/>
Firo: "Waaa, Itadakimasu~" <br/>
 <br/>
Firo takes the pot from the old man and pours all of the contents into her mouth. <br/>
 <br/>
Firo: "N-.....It tastes ok I guess~" <br/>
 <br/>
I returned the pot to the old man. <br/>
He was dumbfounded and just stared at me. <br/>
 <br/>
Naofumi: "Ummm, sorry." <br/>
Old Man: "Lad, treat me to a meal later." <br/>
 <br/>
I'll learn from this mistake. <br/>
 <br/>
Old Man: "Hmmm... Well, I know there are clothes for Demi-humans that transform... But this is a weapon shop, what you are looking for is in a clothing shop." <br/>
Naofumi: "I am with a naked girl in the middle of the night, where am I supposed to find a clothing shop that won't reject me!?" <br/>
Old man: "That's true... Wait here a little." <br/>
 <br/>
The old man went to the back of the shop and all I heard was rustling. <br/>
 <br/>
Old Man: "Don't expect too much since I don't have anything in her size." <br/>
Naofumi: "I understand" <br/>
 <br/>
After a while, the old man came back. <br/>
 <br/>
Old Man:"Damn. I don't have any clothes that will fit her transformed size." <br/>
Naofumi: "What!" <br/>
 <br/>
This is already my last resort... What am I supposed to do? How am I supposed to answer when people ask me why there is a naked little girl without parents in my care? <br/>
My reputation is already bad enough, but this will make it take another nose dive. <br/>
 <br/>
Firo: "Master-" <br/>
Naofumi: "Don't you dare transform!" <br/>
 <br/>
There is no item that keeps a demon in her human form. As expected, humanoid demons are extremely rare. <br/>
 <br/>
Firo: "Nooo-" <br/>
 <br/>
Ku......What the hell is wrong with this child! <br/>
She's refusing everything I told her to do. <br/>
Is this the rebellious phase? No, that's impossible, she was born a few days ago. <br/>
 <br/>
Naofumi: "Then how about this. If you will stay in your human form, we can sleep together." <br/>
 <br/>
After hearing that, Firo has a big smile on her face and tightly holds my hand. <br/>
 <br/>
Naofumi: "Sigh...... why do we have to sleep together." <br/>
Firo: "Because I'm lonely" <br/>
Old Man: "Lad...... Are you serious?" <br/>
 <br/>
I did not come to this world to baby-sit... <br/>
 <br/>
Old Man: "Anyway, where is Raphtalia?" <br/>
Raphtalia: "I finally caught up" <br/>
 <br/>
Raphtalia entered the shop building while panting. <br/>
 <br/>
Raphtalia: "Because you suddenly ran off, I looked everywhere..." <br/>
Naofumi: "Sorry, my bad." <br/>
Firo: "Ah, Raphtalia onee-chan." <br/>
 <br/>
Firo energetically waves. <br/>
 <br/>
Firo: "I'm not giving Master to you~" <br/>
Raphtalia?: "What is this child saying!" <br/>
Naofumi: "No you're not, I'm not yours. In fact you two belong to me." <br/>
 <br/>
As slaves. <br/>
 <br/>
Old Man: "Well, there're no suitable clothes for you today, just return later." <br/>
Naofumi?: "Ah, sorry for the disturbance" <br/>
Firo: "Thanks for the meal." <br/>
Old Man: "I'm always surprised by you, lad." <br/>
 <br/>
We left the weapons shop and walked towards the inn when Raphtalia says. <br/>
 <br/>
Raphtalia: "Ah, the slave.....Demon dealer called." <br/>
Naofumi: "Hm? Understood." <br/>
 <br/>
We returned to the tent, only to be welcomed by the slave trader. <br/>
 <br/>
Slave Trader: "Well, that was certainly a surprising development. Yup." <br/>
Naofumi: "Yeah." <br/>
Slave Trader: "Well, as it turns out, because of eye witness testimony, that is actually a Philorial Queen." <br/>
Naofumi: "Oh? You know about her?" <br/>
Slave Trader: "Yup. I think I understand, Hero of the Shield-sama." <br/>
 <br/>
What's with this slave trader's pretentious expression? <br/>
 <br/>
Slave Trader: "You don't understand?" <br/>
Naofumi: "Hurry and say it." <br/>
 <br/>
The slave trader pointed at Firo who is in her humanoid form, wearing nothing but a tattered mantle. <br/>
 <br/>
Slave Trader: "The Philorial Queen has advanced transformation abilities. Therefore, it changed itself into a normal Philorial to escape attention. At least that's our hypothesis." <br/>
 <br/>
No wonder... If I was in a similar circumstance, I'm sure I would decide to disguise myself too. <br/>
That's reasonable. <br/>
 <br/>
Slave Trader: "Iyahaha. As expected of the Hero of the Shield-sama, to be able to raise a Philorial Queen in such a short time. Yup." <br/>
Naofumi: "What?" <br/>
Slave Trader: "Did you raise a Philorial Queen, or is it a Philorial Queen because you raised it?" <br/>
 <br/>
I understand what the slave trader is saying. This fellow is trying to learn a method on how to produce Philorial Kings from me, and then mass producing. <br/>
It is classified as a considerably rare demon due to it's transformation abilities. Although it stinks, the profits would be massive. <br/>
 <br/>
Naofumi: "Maybe that's just the power of the legendary shield hero." <br/>
 <br/>
I believed this was due to the power of Growth Correction. I couldn't explain how to do this naturally. <br/>
 <br/>
Slave Trader: "Then, can you tell me how you do it? For a price of course." <br/>
Naofumi: "That's not what I mean." <br/>
Slave Trader: "How about raising another Philorial, for free of course-" <br/>
Naofumi: "No thanks!" <br/>
 <br/>
My wallet won't last if there is another mouth to feed. The clothes for Firo won't be free either. If the expenses increase any more, it will be dangerous. <br/>
 <br/>
Slave Trader: "Ha~a...... Well, if you change your mind, please come and find me." <br/>
Naofumi: "We'll see." <br/>
 <br/>
Uah......This slave trader's eyes are sparkling <br/>
I feel sick. <br/>
 <br/>
Naofumi: "This fellow ate meat from the boss of the last wave. I think the possibility of influence from that can't be ignored." <br/>
 <br/>
Well, this feels a little forced anyway. <br/>
But it is the truth that Firo ate chimera meat, so I'm not lying. <br/>
 <br/>
Slave Trader: "I see...Well, that's too bad then." <br/>
 <br/>
The slave trader withdraws reluctantly. <br/>
 <br/>
Slave Trader: "Anyway, I’ll buy your Philorial any time. Yup" <br/>
Naofumi: "I'll decline if I can." <br/>
Slave Trader: "You can accumulate money easily." <br/>
Naofumi: "Well, if the need arises." <br/>
 <br/>
I am aware of the fact that I have become a miser. <br/>
 <br/>
Raphtalia: "Is your conversation over?" <br/>
Naofumi: "Yeah." <br/>
Naofumi?: "Let's go over there." <br/>
Firo?: "What?" <br/>
 <br/>
Firo entered the conversation with a question mark over her head. <br/>
 <br/>
Naofumi: "This is your treat." <br/>
Firo: "Master~ let's sleep together~" <br/>
Raphtalia: "I forbid it!" <br/>
Firo: "Not Fair! Raphtalia onee-chan monopolises Master."  <br/>
Raphtalia: "I do not!" <br/>
 <br/>
You guys are noisy. <br/>
 <br/>
Naofumi: "Well then, Firo, go to the barn and sleep." <br/>
Firo: "No!" <br/>
 <br/>
I was refused by this bird easily. <br/>
 <br/>
Firo: "I want to sleep with Master~" <br/>
 <br/>
I am reminded of a child who wants to sleep with their parents... <br/>
 <br/>
Naofumi: "Well, it can't be helped." <br/>
Raphtalia: "Naofumi-sama!?" <br/>
Naofumi: "It’s fine to be selfish to this degree, it's just sleeping together." <br/>
Raphtalia: "Well... Me too" <br/>
 <br/>
Raphtalia muttered words that I couldn't hear. <br/>
 <br/>
Naofumi: "But, you must not be naked in public!" <br/>
Firo: "Okay!" <br/>
 <br/>
Do you really understand? Oh well, it's fine. I hope that the old man from the weapon shop has something tomorrow. <br/>
I head back to the inn and pay the storekeeper for another night. <br/>
Hmm... Should I study or continue compounding? Well, at least Firo is in human form. <br/>
 <br/>
Firo: "Waa! A soft bed!" <br/>
 <br/>
I decided to sleep early today while watching Firo bounce around on the bed. <br/>
 <br/>
It's hot... <br/>
Why is it so hot!? <br/>
 <br/>
Naofumi: "Uu..." <br/>
 <br/>
My body can't move. <br/>
What is going on? <br/>
When I open my eyes fearfully, all I can see is white. <br/>
I seem to be wrapped in feathers. <br/>
 <br/>
Firo?: "Suu......Suu....." <br/>
 <br/>
The bed breathes! <br/>
I slowly lift my head, It seems the bed I was sleeping on is Firo's true form. <br/>
Firo seems to have returned to her original form after falling asleep. Without her knowing, she started holding me as a hugging pillow. <br/>
 <br/>
Naofumi: "Get up you fat bird!" <br/>
 <br/>
I told you not to return to your true form! <br/>
 <br/>
Firo: "Yan" <br/>
 <br/>
It seems this fellow's true form is able to speak now. <br/>
 <br/>
Raphtalia: "Wh-What's going on!" <br/>
 <br/>
Raphtalia who is half asleep shouts at me. <br/>
 <br/>
Naofumi: "Oh, Raphtalia, Help!" <br/>
 <br/>
This fellow isn't even getting up after I hit her. It is my fault for lacking any offensive abilities. <br/>
 <br/>
Raphtalia: "Get up Firo!" <br/>
 <br/>
Firo: "MunyaMunya......Ma~ster~" <br/>
 <br/>
Firo rolls and flops onto the floor. <br/>
MishiMishiMishi...... <br/>
I heard an unpleasant creaking sound from the wooden floor. It seems to be at its limit. <br/>
 <br/>
Naofumi: "Get up!" <br/>
 <br/>
But there is no sign of Firo stirring while hugging me. <br/>
 <br/>
Raphtalia: "Get up!" <br/>
 <br/>
Raphtalia wrenches open Firo's arm which was hugging me <br/>
I was somehow able to escape through the gap. <br/>
 <br/>
Naofumi: "Fu...... What a terrible morning" <br/>
Firo: "Nnya?" <br/>
 <br/>
It seems when the sensation of hugging me was gone, Firo woke up. <br/>
Firo noticed Raphtalia and I glaring at her and tilts her neck. <br/>
 <br/>
Firo: "What happened?" <br/>
Naofumi: "First of all, change back to your human form." <br/>
Firo: "Eh? When did I change?" <br/>
 <br/>
Ku! I didn't want to do this but it can't be helped! <br/>
I choose the demon icon from the status magic and change the settings to whatever I say becoming absolute. <br/>
Any order cannot be disobeyed if I do this. <br/>
 <br/>
Naofumi: "Become a humanoid!" <br/>
 <br/>
I commanded Firo <br/>
 <br/>
Firo: "No... I want to sleep with Master more~" <br/>
 <br/>
The demon crest appears on Firo's abdomen because she went against my orders. <br/>
 <br/>
Firo?: "Eh?" <br/>
Naofumi: "If you don't listen it'll hurt." <br/>
 <br/>
The demon crest on Firo's body glows red. <br/>
 <br/>
Firo: "Yan" <br/>
 <br/>
A Geometric pattern appears on Firo's wing and moves towards the demon crest. <br/>
With a fizzle, the demon crest became silent again. <br/>
 <br/>
Naofumi: "Ha?" <br/>
 <br/>
I checked the demon icon. It seems the command for absolute obedience was removed. <br/>
I tried to apply it again but nothing happens. <br/>
This demon won't listen to a thing I say? <br/>
Shit! I bought a demon because I expected it to follow my orders. <br/>
Slave trader... Wash your neck because I'm coming for you.
