<br/>
"Wait!" <br/>
A beautiful voice resonates.<br/>
Just that, it wasn’t the usual voice that sounded in my head, but something that I heard directly in my ears.<br/>
What surprised me the most was…<br/>
"…This voice is…Noah-ojousama?" <br/>
It seems the giant hears it too.<br/>
The giant that was expressionless until now was surprised.<br/>
I was being constricted in the hands of the giant.<br/>
I-It hurts.<br/>
"S-Stop it. That boy is my believer." (Noah)<br/>
"…Oh…is that so… I am sorry." <br/>
He suddenly let me go.<br/>
He held me all the way up, so I ended up falling from several meters up.<br/>
"Ouch ouch." (Makoto)<br/>
I fell on my butt.<br/>
Well, that’s not a big problem.<br/>
"Goddess-sama." (Makoto)<br/>
I stagger as I stand up and call her.<br/>
"Fufu! Be grateful, Makoto. Aren’t you glad you are my believer?" (Noah)<br/>
"Uhm, what’s going on?" (Makoto)<br/>
"…We Titans serve the Titan Gods. If you are the believer of Noah-sama, you are as good as family." <br/>
"…I-Is that so." (Makoto)<br/>
It is so sudden that I cannot keep up with this turn of events, but this giant seems to be a Titan and is a comrade of the Goddess.<br/>
Because of that, the giant calmed down with the words of the Goddess.<br/>
But I would have liked you to save me sooner.<br/>
Even though you would usually immediately speak out.<br/>
"Goddess-sama, thank you very much." (Makoto)<br/>
But I will first express my gratitude.<br/>
I seriously thought I was going to die.<br/>
"You are a scaredy-cat huh, Makoto. Titans only eat things that grow from the ground. There’s no way they would eat humans." (Noah)<br/>
"Eh? Really?" (Makoto)<br/>
"…Yeah…I don’t eat meat." <br/>
The giant was vegetarian!<br/>
If that’s the case, please don’t look at us as you say you are hungry.<br/>
I felt like my life shortened there.<br/>
"But why did you send Nina-san flying?" (Makoto)<br/>
"…She suddenly attacked me, so I was surprised… I intended to push her lightly there though." <br/>
That downed a Silver Rank with a hit she couldn’t even react to.<br/>
This old man giant is quite the unbelievable thing.<br/>
"Aah, Makoto, old man, it looks like my time is over. I will leave the rest to you." (Noah)<br/>
After the Goddess said this, I couldn’t hear her anymore.<br/>
What do you expect me to do here anyways?<br/>
The giant old man is nodding for some reason.<br/>
"Oi, Takki-dono!" (Fujiwara)<br/>
"Hey, you giant! Get away from Makoto!" (Lucy)<br/>
Huh?<br/>
Fuji-yan and Lucy who were supposed to have run away came back. <br/>
I told you clearly to run away though.<br/>
"T-Takatsuki-sama?! Did you cut off the finger of the giant with that dagger?!" (Nina)<br/>
Nina-san let out a shocked voice.<br/>
Ah, right.<br/>
"Uhm, sorry. I cut off your finger… You can stick it back on?" (Makoto)<br/>
"…I don’t mind… It will grow back after 10,000 years." <br/>
"T-That’s great to hear." (Makoto)<br/>
That’s one long time, but it looks like he forgave me.<br/>
"""…"""<br/>
Everyone stiffens seeing me talk with the giant normally.<br/>
"It is okay, everyone. This giant is friendly." (Makoto)<br/>
◇◇<br/>
 I explain the relationship between the Goddess and the giant.<br/>
"What, so this one here is a comrade of the Goddess you believe in, Takki-dono?" (Fujiwara)<br/>
"Wait, Makoto. I didn’t hear anything about this. The fact that you were the believer of an Evil God!" (Lucy)<br/>
"L-Lucy-sama? Speaking like that when in front of…" (Nina)<br/>
Everyone was surprised.<br/>
"…We Titans are the protectors of the Titan Gods… But our Lords lost the war, and so, the Giant Gods that are composed of us challenged the God Realm to help them." <br/>
"Gigantomachia, huh." (Nina)<br/>
"I see, because you fought the Holy Gods, you were labelled as evil." (Fujiwara)<br/>
That’s mythology talk.<br/>
This old man, just how long has he been living?<br/>
"…I was sealed around 15,000,000 years ago." <br/>
He read my mind.<br/>
Scary.<br/>
It is so long I can’t even begin to imagine it.<br/>
"Right, you said you were hungry?" (Makoto)<br/>
Let’s change the topic.<br/>
I saw Lucy in the back shiver at that.<br/>
It is okay, this old man apparently only eats vegetables.<br/>
"Fuji-yan, do you have things like bread or fruits?" (Makoto)<br/>
"Y-Yeah, I do." (Fujiwara)<br/>
I had him bring out whatever he had in his storage magic.<br/>
"…Ooh, so nostalgic… To think I would be able to eat the blessings of the earth once more." <br/>
The old man giant is happily eating the bread and the apples.<br/>
Fuji-yan also gave him some wine, and he drank it with glee.<br/>
"…Gotta give you my thanks." <br/>
Judging from his size I thought that maybe he hasn’t had enough to eat, but it seems he is satisfied.<br/>
The giant looks down at us.<br/>
"…Girl of the beast people…sorry for before." <br/>
"N-No, I was the one who attacked first anyways!" (Nina)<br/>
Nina-san is flustered.<br/>
"…I will give you the divine protection of the Earth Giant God." <br/>
"Eh?" (Nina)<br/>
Nina-san got wrapped in light for an instant.<br/>
"Ooh, I feel like power is welling up in me." (Nina)<br/>
Nina-san is looking at her own body restlessly.<br/>
"Let’s see…here!" (Nina)<br/>
Nina-san lightly kicked a boulder nearby.<br/>
In an instant, it changed into a giant boulder and it flew ahead ramming down the trees around.<br/>
"Uwaa, amazing." (Lucy)<br/>
"How did you do that, Nina-dono?" (Fujiwara)<br/>
"N-No, I was just trying to test this out a bit, but this is truly amazing." (Nina)<br/>
She is doing roundhouse kicks in the air.<br/>
I am impressed she can do 3 spins in midair like that.<br/>
Ah, the moment she landed on the ground, a crater was made.<br/>
It seems like Nina-san is surprised by her own ability. <br/>
"…Next would be you who offered me food, huh." <br/>
The big eyes are directed at Fuji-yan.<br/>
"If it’s about that, Giant God-sama! Can you please give me that cut finger?" (Fujiwara)<br/>
It looks like he prefers that Giant’s finger I cut off.<br/>
Lucy and Nina were making dubious expressions.<br/>
They must be thinking that’s in bad taste.<br/>
"…If you are fine with something like that, go ahead." <br/>
"I am grateful-desu zo!" (Fujiwara)<br/>
Fuji-yan wouldn’t just get something without a reason, so he must have one.<br/>
He held it as if precious and put it in his storage magic.<br/>
"…Next is that elf girl, huh." <br/>
"…Y-Yes." (Lucy)<br/>
Lucy grabbed my sleeve nervous.<br/>
She seems to still be scared.<br/>
"…It seems you can’t control your own magic." <br/>
"Y-You can tell?" (Lucy)<br/>
"…By looking at that storm-like mana, yeah." <br/>
So it really is a storm.<br/>
I remember that one time when I synchronized with her.<br/>
"…Lend me your staff." <br/>
"This?" (Lucy)<br/>
Lucy gives him the wood staff she is always using.<br/>
Wouldn’t it break?<br/>
The giant pulls out a strand of hair and wraps it around the staff.<br/>
The hair of the giant turned into some sort of writing of light and was sucked into the staff.<br/>
"…Have it back… With this, you will have an easier time using earth magic." <br/>
"I-I see." (Lucy)<br/>
Lucy had gotten back her staff and hesitantly chanted.<br/>
"[Earth Magic: Earth Bullet]." (Lucy)<br/>
A giant boulder that doesn’t lose to the one of Nina-san just before was shot out.<br/>
"Uhya!" (Nina)<br/>
It passed by real close to where Nina-san was.<br/>
"I-I’m sorry!" (Lucy)<br/>
So the no control still hasn’t healed, huh.<br/>
But the earth magic that she couldn’t get it to work at all in the training had been activated this easily.<br/>
She must have gotten quite the good item there.<br/>
"Fuwaaaa…" (Lucy)<br/>
Lucy was looking at the staff while trembling.<br/>
It looks like she is moved.<br/>
"…Now, that’s all." <br/>
"Eh?" (Makoto)<br/>
Wait, and me?! <br/>
"Wait! Makoto was the one who had it the roughest!" (Lucy)<br/>
Lucy got angry along with me.<br/>
"…You got divine protection from Noah-ojousama and even got a sacred treasure from her, and yet you still wish for more? …Excessive greed will destroy you…" <br/>
Hmm, when you say that much…<br/>
You are telling me to be satisfied with what I have currently?<br/>
"…When you need help, call me through Noah-ojousama. I will help you out only once." <br/>
Ooh! An assist character then?<br/>
When I get into some real trouble let’s have him help me out.<br/>
Speak your wish<br/>
Not saying it now ←<br/>
Oh, it has been a while since I have gotten choices, [RPG Player].<br/>
I don’t really have any wish right now though.<br/>
No, I have one. <br/>
"Can you save Noah-sama from the Deep Sea Temple?" (Makoto)<br/>
"…I can’t… In order for Noah-ojousama to regain her power, there’s the need for a believer to arrive to the Deep Sea Temple… Even if I were to save her, her power won’t return." <br/>
Looks like there’s conditions to it.<br/>
I heard nothing about this, Goddess-sama.<br/>
The old man giant laughed lightly here.<br/>
"…Using your wish for your Lord rather than yourself is good dedication."<br/>
I was praised.<br/>
Looks like the choice was the correct one.<br/>
"…I will give you one piece of advice." <br/>
"Advice?" (Makoto)<br/>
"…The Spirit Language of yours, that’s the language of Gods. Stop it." <br/>
O-Okay…<br/>
I can’t use Spirit Magic if I stop using Spirit Language though.<br/>
"…Spirit Language has meaning when Titans use it. If you want to use the Spirit’s powers in a mortal body, you have to see the Spirits, converse with them, and get close to them." <br/>
"I can’t see them though." (Makoto)<br/>
If I could, I wouldn’t be having it so hard. <br/>
"…Look." <br/>
He grabbed my head.<br/>
Strange mana was flowing into my body.<br/>
Is this Synchronization?<br/>
"Eh?" (Makoto)<br/>
In front of me there were streams of light.<br/>
Green, blue, yellow, white; I was surrounded by a variety of lights.<br/>
I have never seen fireflies in Tokyo, but being surrounded by them would most likely feel like this.<br/>
The lights disappear.<br/>
The hand of the giant separates.<br/>
"…Did you see?" <br/>
I did.<br/>
So those were Spirits, huh.<br/>
What an incredible amount.<br/>
"…People that don’t have the talent can’t see them… It seems you are liked by the Spirits." <br/>
"…Spirit Language is an order from the Titans… Spirits don’t like being ordered." <br/>
"…Look at the Spirits, talk with them, and get close to them." <br/>
"…Devote yourself." <br/>
"Thank you very much." (Makoto)<br/>
He taught me a variety of things that will help me out.<br/>
"…Now then, farewell." <br/>
The giant disappears inside the ground.<br/>
