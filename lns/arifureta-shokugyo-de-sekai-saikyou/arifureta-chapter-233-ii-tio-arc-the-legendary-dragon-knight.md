Arifureta After II   The Legendary Dragon Knight<br/>
<br/>
"Ee, everyone. This is sudden, but we are not anyone suspicious by any means. In this situation, we should strive to reach a mutual understanding peacefully, by means of communication like a cultured human shouldn’t wee-"<br/>
The voice of Hajime that was amply filled with sincerity was resounding throughout the whole airspace. He was appealing by using telepathy, so his voice should undoubtedly reach both the army and the air pirates.<br/>
While the air pirates’ airship and the army’s mothership, which was located diagonally right behind it, were approaching, Hajime was hovering in midair while showing a friendly smile. The first impression was truly the most important thing in forming a personal relationship.<br/>
Tio, who was nestling close beside him, was nursing the small dragon in her arms while acting the straight-man「No matter how they look, thou only look like someone suspicious though」, but it didn’t even give a single scratch to Hajime’s ignoring skill.<br/>
Hajime lifted up both his hands to appeal that he had no hostility while he continued his words like a cultured modern-day person.<br/>
"We don’t have any hostile intentions. No, honestly! I’m not lying at all! It will be a cold day in hell before I lie. A person like me is saying that, that’s why there can be no doubt about it. We don’t have any hostile intentions!"<br/>
「It sounds extremely fishy……」<br/>
Tio was saying something again, but his ignoring skill level had reached the max value, so there was no problem.<br/>
"Everyone, it appears that all of you are pursuing after this rug rat dragon, but the two of us don’t need it! Rather, we are even seriously wondering whether we should just toss this thing away over there."<br/>
‘We don’t have any intention of snatching your prey okaaay!’ Hajime appealed so, but for some reason, hostility was overflowing from the pilots of both factions circling in the surrounding. Especially all the pilots of the air pirates, their rage was fierce. They were laying out their protest by punching *bang bang* at their cockpit’s windbreaker.<br/>
"……It was a joke. Just now was a joke filled with wit. That was my consideration to everyone trying to calm down this place. Anyway, we don’t have any intention of snatching this thing, so we will hand over this rug rat. Owner-san, please come out to the fro~~nt."<br/>
For some reason, when Hajime said "rug rat" or "owner", the killing intent of the air pirates pilots doubled. Somehow, he got the feeling that the more he talked, the more their hostility fanned up.<br/>
Even while Hajime was making a speech like that, the airship of the air pirates had approached nearby.<br/>
There, perhaps their mental petrification against the really strange duo was finally dispelled because the sky battle force of the army was starting to make a move.<br/>
It seemed that it was a fact that they tried to capture the small dragon alive, so instead of attacking Hajime and Tio, they resumed their attack on the airship.<br/>
Perhaps it should be called as an abnormal obsession because the airship was recklessly charging forward without even taking any evasive maneuvers. It was being bombed directly and was damaged all over.<br/>
The pilots of the air pirates returned fire. However, because their numbers were reduced by the army’s overwhelming attack, and how the airship wasn’t taking sufficient evasive maneuvers, and because there were Hajime and Tio――or more accurately, the small dragon nearby, their movement was restrained, and they were unable to deploy in a defensive battle like before.<br/>
"Ee, everyone, let’s calm down for now. I will hand over this rug ra――this young dragon, so both sides, please stop your ships. Let’s talk it out with each other about the handing over――"<br/>
「Please match your speed with usss-. And then, give Kuwaibel to me! Please-」<br/>
The amplified voice of a woman――no, a girl, reached Hajime, cutting off his speech.<br/>
When Hajime turned his gaze there, he could see on the front deck of the airship that was charging here, a girl carrying something that looked like a megaphone was leaning her body forward on the handrail that caused her to look like she could fall off at any moment. Behind the girl were a tall blonde-haired young woman and a young man with the same blonde hair standing by. They were desperately holding the girl who looked like she could fall off.<br/>
The girl’s silver semi-long hair was wild from the strong wind. But, the girl’s expression was even wilder than that. Looking closer, she was a beauty. However, her eyes that were greatly slanting upward and her desperate look that resembled an ogre were honestly at a creepy level.<br/>
But, her figure that was reaching out her hand earnestly and sincerely even when she knew that she wouldn’t reach conveyed the seriousness of the girl.<br/>
The ship wasn’t decelerating. It would get shot down if it stopped. It was something definite. That was why the girl yelled for Hajime to match their speed pleadingly.<br/>
The airship was passing by so close that it almost grazed Hajime and Tio. The girl was still reaching out her hand with a despairing and grieving expression.<br/>
Hajime and Tio looked at each other’s face.<br/>
「Aa~. It looks like they also know the name of this rug rat, and based on the situation, perhaps what this thing meant by friend referred to the air pirates――let’s toss this thing to that girl and get away from here.」<br/>
「This hath really become troublesome in various aspects, I understand.」<br/>
They nodded once. Hajime and Tio started sliding backward with sudden speed.<br/>
The movement that wholly ignored things like propulsive force, or dynamics, caused several pilots who were looking for a chance to open their eyes wide in shock.<br/>
Hajime and Tio instantly approached the airship’s deck.<br/>
The girl’s expression greatly brightened up. The blonde-haired duo behind her looked wary.<br/>
Perhaps thinking that the small dragon was going to be handed over, the mothership behind the airship launched an innumerable number of missiles. It seemed that it took into consideration that the small dragon was nearby, so its main cannon, the majestic 3-gun turret, stayed silent, but in front of nearly fifty missiles, it was hard to say that it was "fortunate".<br/>
The Vulcan cannon loaded aboard the airship spouted fire, shooting down the missile swarm, but in the first place, it couldn’t take evasive maneuvers. The sky battlecraft pilots also joined in the interception, but naturally, by doing that, the response toward the army’s sky battlecraft thinned down.<br/>
One plane slipped through the defensive line of the air pirates and launched its missile.<br/>
Most likely its aim was the bridge. Human silhouettes could be seen across the windbreaker of a place that was jutting out in the central position of the airship.<br/>
The girl and the blonde-haired duo opened their eyes wide. They were staring dumbfounded at their last moment――<br/>
Ahead of their gaze, one smoking sky battlecraft barged in. It slipped in between the bridge and the flying missile without any hesitation.<br/>
It was a shield with one’s life on the line. For a "pirate", that skill, that spirit, that everything, was noble.<br/>
A flame blast illuminated the bridge, the girl and others on the deck, and Hajime and Tio who were flying parallel to the airship.<br/>
The plane’s rear part was pulverized, and the front nose was torn to pieces. It was merely luck that the cockpit wasn’t blasted off.<br/>
But, there wasn’t any concept of bailout or anything for the pilots of this world. The reason was that there was nothing but the sea of clouds below when they ejected out. Inside that was a hell that rejected human survival.<br/>
「Bovid-!!」<br/>
The girl’s pained voice resounded at the interstice of the wind’s howl. Even though she wasn’t using a megaphone, the fact that her voice resounded excessively clearly was surely because the pilot was an important person for her.<br/>
「……Good grief. Well, I’m Japanese after all aren’t I?」<br/>
For some reason, Hajime was making a strange excuse while taking out something from the "Treasure Warehouse II" that he threw away. That thing, which was flying at a high speed that was unthinkable to be able to reach the battlecraft just from a snap of the wrist slid right under the cockpit part that was about to vanish into the sea of clouds.<br/>
And then, that thing that spread out with a *kashun-* sound――variable type chakram "Orestes" ―― swallowed the cockpit along with the pilot through its center.<br/>
The girl and others leaked out「Eh?」while at the same time, another "Orestes" that was also thrown on the deck unfolded, and the cockpit appeared from there. The deck was dented along with a loud impact sound. The pilot who returned safely (?) looked dazed from being unable to comprehend what happened.<br/>
Hajime caught the returning "Orestes" while calling out to the girl and others who were dumbfounded by the unbelievable sight.<br/>
「O~i, you over there! You are this guy’s owner――not that; you’re his friend? You are, aren’t you?」<br/>
「Eh? A, e, u, tha, that’s righttt!」<br/>
Hajime asked while poking at the small dragon Tio was carrying. The girl was in a state of ‘presently in chaos!’; however, she somehow returned a word of affirmative.<br/>
Hajime nodded「Yosh」.<br/>
「Then, I’ll return him, so catch him properly okaaay!」<br/>
「Eh? Catch? Eh?」<br/>
Hajime directed a really nice smile at the girl who was all flustered and shook up. He ignored Tio who was speaking hesitantly「No, Goshujin-sama. Although the situation is as it is, that art a bit……」, and he strongly grasped the small dragon in an eagle grip.<br/>
And then, he tossed it away「Hoi-」with a really casual feeling.<br/>
「WAITTTTTTTTTT-, WHAT ARE YOU DOINGGGGG-」<br/>
The girl screamed; however, she did that while running on the deck with surprising swiftness and performed a diving catch for the small falling dragon. At that occasion, she also seemed to perform a face slide, but she seemed to be unexpectedly tough because right after she lifted the small dragon to show the panicked blonde-haired duo.<br/>
That figure looked like an outfielder baseball player showing his fine play, or it closely resembled a person of a certain unpopulated island going「I CAUGHT ITT―――!!」. The blonde-haired duo was rushing to the girl while applauding. (TN: Click here if you want to see the pose. I don’t really know what this refers too. Perhaps some kind of TV show in Japan?)<br/>
Seeing their figures like that, Hajime showed a really satisfied smile that seemed to say「Today too, I’m accumulating good deeds yeah」before he used telepathy once more.<br/>
"Everyone, with this we are not involved anymore. From the start, we were just a virtuous duo passing by, and so, we will quickly vanish so that we won’t be a bother to everyone. Well then-"<br/>
Hajime prompted Tio and rotated his skyboard. The skyboard turned 90 degrees and left from the course of the air pirates. That was a course that went away from the cloud mountain range. Hajime predicted that the air pirates, who had recovered the small dragon, would head toward the cloud mountain range in order to escape the army, so he chose a course that was the exact opposite from that route.<br/>
But, destiny-san wouldn’t let such a shallow demon king-san to get away! It was impossible to escape from destiny-san!<br/>
「Piih!? Pii~~? Pipiih!? Pii――――!!」<br/>
「Ah――, Ku-chan! DON’T GOOO-. COME BACK HEREEEEE-」<br/>
Such a cry and scream could be heard from behind.<br/>
When Hajime and Tio looked behind them in surprise, the awakened small dragon was chasing after them once more. Perhaps the girl had jumped out overenthusiastically because she dove past the handrail, but the blonde-haired duo caught her legs before it was too late.<br/>
The screams (?) of the blonde-haired duo「Pr, princessss-. Do you want to dieee-」or 「Aa, this is bad-. Roze-sama’s clothes are slipping offffff-」who were looking desperate could be heard. The pilot, who went through that emergency landing on the deck, jumped out from the cockpit in a panic and joined in the rescue of the girl whose buttocks was getting exposed.<br/>
「Wai-, why are you chasing us!? Just as I thought Tio, a strange smell really is coming from you!?」<br/>
「That’s a cruel remark don’t thou know!? Even if it’s me, I couldst still feel hurt here!?」<br/>
Hajime and Tio accelerated rapidly.<br/>
However, surprisingly, the small dragon made its body to be clad in a silver color and chased them steadily. In contrast to the tininess of its body and its pitiful ‘pii pii’  cry, it was unexpectedly a speedy fighter.<br/>
「Uwaa, somehow everyone is following after us……what’s with this game of tag?」<br/>
「This art chaos.」<br/>
In the world of twilight, Hajime and Tio were in the lead with a small dragon, the air pirates’ sky battlecraft, the army’s sky battlecraft, airship, and mothership pursuing them in a straight line, which created a bizarre sight. Hajime was looking weary while Tio’s face was twitching.<br/>
Even when they attempted to camouflage themselves using the pencil Cross Velts, as long as the small dragon was chasing after Tio by somehow grasping her position accurately, there was no other way to get away other than using speed.<br/>
Hajime withdrew Donner from his holster and loaded it with a special bullet, "Excise Bullet". It was a special bullet that could change places, along with the space around it, to another spatial coordinate. By firing the bullet with electromagnetic acceleration, and then exchanging places with it when it was at its farthest distance away, it enabled the user himself to move in the pseudo realm of electromagnetic acceleration.<br/>
「Tio, grab on to me. We are teleporting.」<br/>
「……Right. That’s fine but……why didn’t Goshujin-sama use it when chasing after that Higgs fellow?」<br/>
Hajime’s gaze wandered around a bit while,「You, it’s that you know, that. Yes, interfering in the battle between you and that guy is just inelegant, right?」, he was making a strangely lame excuse while his finger was about to pull the trigger.<br/>
But, just before he could,<br/>
「Whoops」<br/>
Hajime controlled the skyboard and made a sharp turn. The place where they were just at the moment before was pelted by innumerable bullets.<br/>
Furthermore, the sky battlecraft squad that cut in on the path Hajime was turning to was carrying out a strafing run with the Vulcan to reduce Hajime and Tio into meat scraps without even a shred of mercy.<br/>
Hajime further barrel rolled to avoid that, but,<br/>
「Oi oi, they are really feverish with murderous impulse huh.」<br/>
「Looks like they art losing their temper with this game of tag.」<br/>
Ahead of their gaze after turning around was the form of the mothership that had unnoticeably taken a steep climb and aimed its gun turret from its lower part from the far height. It seemed the turret was a type that could be stowed in since that turret that was protruding out from the ship’s bottom was opening its large nozzle that had a diameter of around two meters.<br/>
It was a caliber that was too big to shoot cannonballs, but it seemed what it would shoot wasn’t something like cannon balls or missiles.<br/>
It had a silver light converging in it. The energy was so immense their skin could feel it. No matter how they looked at it, it was in the preparation stage to fire a beam cannon like a space battleship that you often saw in SF.<br/>
Going with firing the main cannon of a mothership that was boasting its hugeness just to kill two people, these guys were really a bunch with a screw loose in the head.<br/>
Naturally, Hajime was trying to take evasive maneuvers, but the aim of that cannon turret was detailed in contrast to its size. Furthermore, the army’s sky battlecraft were joining in on the attack from all directions to seal their movement so that they couldn’t escape from the firing line.<br/>
Indeed, although this was for the sake of breaking the deadlock of the situation, it was unthinkable that the height of this killing intent was coming from the bunch who were refraining themselves from large-scale attacks in consideration of the small dragon’s existence.<br/>
"Oi, we told you already before, we don’t have any hostile intentions. We also don’t want anything to do with that small dragon! We also don’t want to get involved with you guys! We are going to disappear right away, so pull ba――"<br/>
Hajime’s persuading words resounded to the whole airspace using telepathy. But, before he could finish his sentence――the atmosphere burst.<br/>
*GOU-* The silver bombardment was fired from diagonally above and exploded the air. Due to the sky battlecraft attacking in waves, a wall of bullets was created between the two and the pursuing small dragon, distancing the two sides.<br/>
Therefore, that merciless attack dyed the world in a madder red color as though it was midday. Pouring down on Hajime and Tio like an iron hammer from the sky.<br/>
「Piih! PIIIIIH」<br/>
「Ku-chan-, Kuwaibel-! Come back quickly! Just what are you thinking of about those two!?」<br/>
The girl on the pursuing airship was desperately raising her voice using a megaphone at the small dragon that was forced to evade due to the shockwave that shook the atmosphere. Even the sky battlecraft pilots of the air pirates, which had been reduced in number, were making a shuddering expression at the bombardment of the mothership while circling around to the small dragon’s side.<br/>
The game of tag was over. The air pirates were now too far away from the area of the cloud mountain range that was their only chance of escaping. Actually, the inside of that mountain range area was relatively calmer compared to the sea of clouds, so it was the optimum place to conceal themselves, but it was impossible for them to return there now. The only way that remained for them now was only to dive into the sea of clouds even though they would crash nine times out of ten by doing that.<br/>
And to do that, they had to take the small dragon back into the airship even a second faster.<br/>
But, the small dragon in question was only raising its cry at the silver pillar of light as though it was searching for something.<br/>
It was as though it was convinced of the survival of those two who had disappeared inside the pillar without even a one in ten thousandth chance to stay alive……<br/>
「Li, es……impossible……」<br/>
Those words were surely representing the feelings of all the people on this battlefield.<br/>
The silver bombardment from the warship was vanishing as though it was melting into the air.<br/>
That attack should’ve annihilated everything without leaving even dust behind. However, while the brightness that was like midday was vanishing and the color of twilight was returning to the world, the future that should’ve been absolute was overturned.<br/>
What appeared was a sphere.<br/>
That solid metallic sphere, which was shining gently from the reflection of the evening sun, was further surrounded by jet black and crimson colored crosses around it.<br/>
「……It was an unknown attack, so just in case I jointly used the eight-point barrier and Aidion at the same time, but it seems that attack doesn’t have the power to break through the space isolation.」<br/>
「Well, this defense couldst even completely block the disintegration bombardment of the god’s apostles. As long as it’s not even a penetrating attack that ignores defense, it’s next to impossible to slip through Goshujin-sama’s defensive wall.」<br/>
*kashun-kashun-kashun-* With such a sound, the metallic sphere――variable style large shield "Aidion" ――was undoing its omnidirectional defense. It was several layers of shields sliding and contracting continuously smaller into its neighbor. Before long, the sphere was switching to its normal mode of a coffin form. At the same time, the eight-point barrier also vanished.<br/>
The battlefield was silent. No, more accurately the sound of the wind and the planes’ thrusters were reverberating, but the people on this battlefield were so speechless to the degree that it felt like that.<br/>
They were rightly amazed and dumbfounded. An individual was pulling through after a direct hit by the main cannon of a mothership class battleship unharmed. Everyone’s reaction was understandable.<br/>
On the battlefield that became still as death, Hajime started to monitor the conversations on the bridge of the mothership using the application of telepathy even while feeling his blood rushing to his head.<br/>
While they were all in a straight line pursuit, because the small dragon was in the line of fire the mothership couldn’t attack satisfactorily and left the attacking to its sky battlecraft. Yet why did they suddenly act decisively by attacking like that……<br/>
Inside the bridge of the mothership that Hajime was skillfully monitoring……<br/>
"Shit-, even that was defended-. Those guys, as expected they are monsters-"<br/>
"Impossible……we had confirmed it from the recording of Glowser 4, but……even though it was just sixty percent, that was the main cannon. Just what in the world are those two……"<br/>
"Captain-. Quick, quickly prepare the next attack-. The one with full power! If not, everyone will be slaughtered again!"<br/>
"Shut up, Higgs! We, the soldiers of the divine country are the chosen people that rule the sky. There is no way we will lose against just two pirates!"<br/>
"But-, those two aren’t human! You saw it right-? The male destroyed a sky battlecraft personally, and the female transformed into a dragon and pursued me hot on my tail even when I used maximum speed!"<br/>
"Chih. Oi, someone take Higgs away! He is an eyesore!"<br/>
It seemed that surviving sky battlecraft had a system for video recording loaded in it. With that, they knew the incomprehensible strength of Hajime and Tio; and using the chance when they were some distance from the small dragon, they launched an attack that could be said to be excessive. That seemed to be the case.<br/>
The person who seemed to be the ship captain gave an order with an angry voice at his subordinates inside the bridge who were making noise from feeling shaken.<br/>
"Launch the air battle squads that are in the middle of standby! Don’t let those two get near the air pirates and the monarch dragon! Helmsman, circle to the left side of the target with velocity 3! Replenish the main cannon, maximum power! Fix pod number 1 to 20 to the target. Bullet type Grog! Keep firing without pause! There is no way a shield that can block an attack like that can hold out for long! Crush them with quantity!"<br/>
It seemed they were seriously planning to shoot down Hajime and Tio.<br/>
The mothership was starting to circle to the left side while spouting out silver light. The Vulcan barrels and cannon barrels that could bombard using medium size bullet types were directed at Hajime and Tio.<br/>
Hajime’s eyes narrowed quietly. He broadcasted a voice that was losing its intonation using telepathy.<br/>
"You can hear me, right? Listen well; I’ll say it one more time, okay? We don’t have the intention of getting involved with the dispute between you guys. We have the awareness that it’s us who are trespassing in your territory. We, the nuisances, will disappear. That’s why, so don’t direct your killing intent at us more than this."<br/>
It was silent for a while. The army side was bewildered with the voice that was resounding in their head; however, the captain spoke his answer from his spot even while half in doubt whether his voice would be transmitted.<br/>
"Sleep talk after you go to sleep. There is no way we can just leave alone anyone with that kind of bizarre power and also being obsessed so much by that monarch dragon. Originally, we would want to catch you two for human experimentation to search for the secret of that power, but you two are just too dangerous. That’s to say nothing of how you two had laid your hands on the pilots of our army who are the people of god. We will kill you two right here, right now, for sure."<br/>
The main cannon of the mothership was gathering an immense amount of energy. Innumerable sky battlecraft flew out from it. Their number was already surpassing fifty planes when combined with the planes that had already come out from the battle before this.<br/>
The small dragon was trying to approach Hajime and Tio, but the army’s sky battlecraft were obstructing it with a wall of sound waves. They also attacked the air pirates. The air pirates’ sky battlecraft already amounted to less than ten.<br/>
「Piih. PIIIIH」<br/>
Just what was making it trying that hard? The small dragon was desperately calling out to Hajime and Tio. It didn’t want to get separated from them, or perhaps, it was asking them to escape together……it also looked like it was saying that kind of thing.<br/>
Hajime loosened up his expressionless face a bit and pulled the trigger of Donner. Two streaks of light flew out. One went toward the small dragon, and the other one went toward the girl on the airship. Just before it shot them through in a flash, the special bullets "Excise Bullet" stopped still in place, and using its effect, the small dragon was instantly transferred to the girl’s location.<br/>
「Just stay quiet at your friend’s side. Okay?」<br/>
「Pii……pih」<br/>
「Ku, Kuwaibel, is listening to what he is told?」<br/>
Those words that were said with an unexpectedly gentle voice in contrast with the dangerous atmosphere the speaker was clad in made the small dragon look alternately between Hajime and Tio restlessly, but after a slight hesitation, it replied back energetically. The girl who embraced the small dragon so that it wouldn’t run away for a second time showed a surprised expression at its behavior.<br/>
In addition, before they realized it, several Cross Velts were floating around the airship, forming a protective barrier.<br/>
The focused silver light was already at a critical point. The attack of the army’s sky battlecraft that became unreserved due to the small dragon’s distance was increasing in fierceness. Several thousand Vulcan bullets, several hundred missiles, and sound waves that were even accompanied with shockwaves came in such an absurd number that it was presumptuous even to call it overkill. And all those were concentrated toward just two people.<br/>
A flame blast enveloped the barrier, and the figures of the two disappeared inside as though a small sun was coming into existence there.<br/>
They were receiving that many concentrated attacks; however, Hajime, who continued to defend using only a barrier of space isolation, turned his gaze at Tio beside him. Tio shrugged and answered back at the wordless question.<br/>
「Goshujin-sama who art still trying to persuade them somehow even when having that much killing intent directed at thee art also not bad but……as expected, acting absurdly unreasonable with no question asked, that art what truly worthy for mine master. Goshujin-sama, holding back this late art unnecessary. Mine will art always together with Goshujin-sama.」<br/>
Hajime displayed a fearless grin and embraced Tio. If the figures of a man embracing the waist of a beautiful girl on the skyboard weren’t hard to see because of the flame blast from the missiles enveloping them, then surely the expression of the enemies would convulse grandly.<br/>
A calm voice resounded across the battlefield that was decorated with explosive sounds and impact sounds.<br/>
"……This is your last warning. Get lost, right now."<br/>
Not just the captain of the mothership, but all the people who heard that voice felt a shiver down their spine from terror. But, unfortunately, it seemed they converted that terror into rage using their elitism and pride that was oozing from their every single word.<br/>
"Don’t falter! Fix them in place! They cannot move-. Their shield too shouldn’t be able to hold out for long anymore-. Show our power as the soldiers of the divine country! Main cannon, status!?"<br/>
"Five percent left until the full charge, four percent, three percent……full charge! We can fire anytime-"<br/>
"Fire at the count of five! Air battle squads, pull back!"<br/>
The red sky that was turning dark was dyed by the silver of midday once more.<br/>
It was incomparable with the previous one, and it wasn’t just the turret below the mothership, even the 3-gun turrets installed on the front deck also fired bombardments at exactly the same scale. The total of four silver bombardments tore through the sky with a might that ripped apart the atmosphere. The diameter of its hit range could reach ten meters. If the after-shock was included, then the area of another further ten meters was fatal territory.<br/>
Hajime and Tio’s figure vanished along with a flame blast that bloomed in the sky.<br/>
The world rumbled. The sea of clouds directly below was undulating and splitting from the impact. The cloud mountain range located far away had a large hole opened in its side and scattered away wholly.<br/>
Inside the light that should be called an aurora, the people from both camps were fixing their eyes upon that scene while holding their arm over their eyes or through a visor――<br/>
They witnessed it right after that.<br/>
*GOU-* The jet black spiral that blew upward and pierced the sky.<br/>
In defiance of the silver light, that pure black looked as though it was wordlessly asserting that it wouldn’t be dyed by any other existence no matter what.<br/>
「What’s, that……」Someone whispered.<br/>
At that moment, the jet black whisper converged tighter. It rushed out from the silver torrent and became a whirling sphere in the sky.<br/>
And then, it ruptured. As though the seal was broken. As though, born from a jet black cocoon――a figure appeared.<br/>
A single roar. A single flap of wings.<br/>
That form was magnificently, majestically, and gallantly conveying without a scruple of dignity as the supreme ruler of the sky that didn’t fear or hesitate against anything.<br/>
The large build that drew a line against the emaciated dragons of this world, and the overflowing dominating aura. Its existence’s mightiness that the skin, or perhaps the instincts, could feel.<br/>
"I’m concluding you guys, as my "enemy". I don’t care whether you are from a divine country, or if you are a chosen race, or whatever. But you can learn it with your own body. That my wife is the one and only supreme ruler of the sky."<br/>
Those words echoed through the whole airspace.<br/>
The people who suddenly regained their senses with a ‘hah’ noticed something despite this late hour.<br/>
Of the existence on the back of the hovering black dragon, with its wings spread and the blazing sun behind it. There, a man was standing imposingly, glaring down at everything.<br/>
Everyone couldn’t help but to feel awed by that figure mounting the back of the dragon that they had never even seen before.<br/>
Everyone held their breath and lost their words. <br/>
In the middle of that, the girl who was holding the small dragon murmured in astonishment.<br/>
She recalled a fairy tale that she knew since she was little. Yes, that was the legendary……<br/>
「……Dragon Knight, sama?」<br/>
