<br/>
"…Why…did my charm…my singing…not work?" <br/>
The Harpy Queen who is now only a severed head was letting out a pained voice.<br/>
Eh? You can still speak?<br/>
"What’s with this woman…? Why is she alive? This is scary." (Lucy)<br/>
Lucy is shocked.<br/>
Yeah, me too.<br/>
I feel like it might come out in my sleep, so please stop with the speaking severed head.<br/>
"That Bitch…where is Elder Sister-sama?" (Aya)<br/>
Sa-san is speaking to the severed head.<br/>
It is quite the surreal sight, but it is a serious topic, so let’s not say anything.<br/>
"…I don’t know… After she opened the entrance of the lamia lair, she disappeared somewhere…" <br/>
"…I see." (Aya)<br/>
Sa-san’s voice portrayed her disappointment.<br/>
I see, there’s still one more target she has to take her revenge on.<br/>
So, what do we do about this severed head?<br/>
"The lifeforce of a monster that has lived for more than a hundred years is abnormal after all. But the source of power for monsters is their heart. With her head and body separated, she will most likely die soon." (Nina)<br/>
Nina-san explains to me who is a bit scared.<br/>
What a relief.<br/>
"By the way, why were you not controlled, Takatsuki-kun?" (Aya)<br/>
"That’s something that I am interested in too!" (Nina)<br/>
Nina-san and Sa-san turn with a question of their own.<br/>
Lucy is using her staff to poke the head of the Harpy Queen.<br/>
Stop that.<br/>
"It is apparently difficult to affect me with temptation magic or charm skills. I have [Clear Mind] after all." (Makoto)<br/>
"Hmm, I did hear that mind stabilizing skills can allow you to resist charms and illusions…" (Nina)<br/>
Nina-san is tilting her head.<br/>
"It is weird that it doesn’t work at all." (Makoto) <br/>
"But it is thanks to Takatsuki-kun’s acting that I was able to get my revenge." (Aya)<br/>
Sa-san is still burying her face on my chest.<br/>
It is already getting embarrassing, you know.<br/>
Can we separate already?<br/>
"Aya, get off Makoto already." (Lucy)<br/>
Maybe she got bored of poking the head, Lucy came here.<br/>
"Eeh, just a bit more, a bit more…" (Aya)<br/>
Lucy tried to tear her away from me, and Sa-san is going no no. <br/>
It is like I am watching a little sister and big sister, and it is heartwarming.<br/>
But I would prefer if they did this without me in between.<br/>
"Now that I think about it, you have seen a Goddess, Takatsuki-sama?" (Nina)<br/>
Nina-san says this with deep interest.<br/>
"Yeah, she shows up in my dreams every now and then. She did so yesterday too." (Makoto)<br/>
"Ooh! If it is after you saw an actual Goddess, I can understand why the charm effect of the siren song didn’t work at all!" (Nina)<br/>
Is that how it works?<br/>
"Takatsuki-kun, what’s a Goddess?" (Aya)<br/>
"Makoto is the believer of an Evil God, you know. She is apparently incredibly beautiful." (Lucy)<br/>
"Yeah yeah, she is incredibly beautiful and tries to seduce me every now and then." (Makoto)<br/>
"A-A Goddess tries to seduce you?!" (Nina)<br/>
"She had some real provocative attire yesterday, and she touches my body pretty often…" (Makoto)<br/>
That really makes my heart throb, so I would like her to stop that.<br/>
"Eeh…could that Goddess-sama be a bitch?" (Lucy)<br/>
Lucy! What a thing to say!<br/>
It isn’t true, right?<br/>
(Hey, I am a Virgin Goddess!) (Noah)<br/>
"The Goddess is saying that she is a virgin." (Makoto)<br/>
I announce this for the sake of her honor.<br/>
"The fact that she says it herself is suspicious." (Aya)<br/>
Sa-san, don’t say that.<br/>
"E-Everyone, saying all that about a God will invite divine retribution, you know? Ah, looks like the Harpy Queen has died." (Nina)<br/>
While we were having a stupid conversation, the Harpy Queen apparently died.<br/>
Well, who cares.<br/>
"Is there some sort of rare material?" (Makoto)<br/>
"The feathers might serve as materials. But for a monster that has lived for more than a hundred years, their hearts are the most important part." (Nina)<br/>
"Hoh, this?" (Aya)<br/>
Sa-san took out the heart of the Harpy Queen without any hesitation.<br/>
Grotesque…<br/>
"There should be a magic crystal in the heart." (Nina)<br/>
"Hm, is it this?" (Aya)<br/>
There’s a magic crystal shining in orange on the hand of Sa-san.<br/>
"Ooh! What a splendid sized magic crystal. This will definitely be worth a good coin." (Nina)<br/>
"There’s one other one." (Aya)<br/>
"What?" (Nina)<br/>
Sa-san took out a magic crystal shining purple of around the same size.<br/>
"For some reason, it calms me down when I hold this magic crystal…" (Aya)<br/>
Sa-san was looking intently at the magic crystal.<br/>
"This magic crystal is most likely the one from the Lamia Queen…" (Nina)<br/>
"?! This is?" (Makoto)<br/>
I see, so it is a memento of Sa-san’s mother. <br/>
"Shouldn’t it be better if Aya were to keep it?" (Lucy)<br/>
"Yeah, it is Sa-san’s." (Makoto)<br/>
I agree with Lucy.<br/>
"Eh? But…" (Aya)<br/>
"I think Goshujin-sama will also happily say the same thing." (Nina)<br/>
"Thanks…" (Aya)<br/>
Sa-san hugged the magic crystal gently into her chest.<br/>
I really am glad we managed to get her revenge.<br/>
◇◇<br/>
 "Now then, how about we go back?" (Makoto)<br/>
"Are we going through the hole again?" (Lucy)<br/>
Lucy doesn’t seem to like the idea.<br/>
"It can’t be helped. There’s no other path." (Makoto)<br/>
"We safely won, so—everyone! Silent!" (Nina)<br/>
"Someone has come." (Lucy)<br/>
Nina-san’s eyes got sharp and Lucy took a stance with her staff.<br/>
After that, my Detection also reacted.<br/>
"Looks like a party of humans are fighting monsters." (Aya)<br/>
Looking at the place Sa-san is pointing, there’s a group of around 20 surrounded by monsters.<br/>
"What should we do?" (Makoto)<br/>
"I leave it to you, Makoto!" (Lucy)<br/>
Hm, Sa-san and Nina-san are also looking at me.<br/>
"For now, I still have a bit of leeway in the number of times I can use Spirit Magic, so let’s save them." (Makoto)<br/>
I took 1 week, and yet, it didn’t have much of a turn.<br/>
"Spirit-sans, Spirits-sans, please help me for a bit. [Water Magic: Water Whale]." (Makoto)<br/>
A giant water whale appears.<br/>
It swims in the underground lake area, and drags the party of 20 as it flails the monsters with its tail.<br/>
"Wawa!" "Hey!" <br/>
Lucy and Sa-san hugged me.<br/>
A massive amount of water washes to our location with the group of humans.<br/>
"Takatsuki-sama, I am surprised you can control water in such a skillful manner…" (Nina)<br/>
Nina-san says this amazed.<br/>
"Hm? These guys are the Sun Knight Order." (Lucy)<br/>
"That’s true." (Makoto)<br/>
They do have the phoenix crest at their chest.<br/>
That means he is also here?<br/>
"Is everyone okay?!" <br/>
The one who appeared was the Light Hero, Sakurai-kun.<br/>
"Hey there, Sakurai-kun." (Makoto)<br/>
"T-Takatsuki-kun? Was that magic yours?" (Sakurai)<br/>
"Uhm, how to say it…" (Makoto)<br/>
"Ryousuke, are you okay?! Wait, hm? You are…" <br/>
The one who came right after was our classmate, Yokoyama-san.<br/>
"Saki-chan?" (Aya)<br/>
"Eh? Could you possibly be Aya-chan?" (Yokoyama)<br/>
‘No way, you were alive?’, ‘It has been a while’, ‘Where were you?’, ‘Your atmosphere has changed’, ‘Yeah, a bit’.<br/>
The two girls were having a heated conversation.<br/>
Sa-san and Yokoyama-san were good friends, huh.<br/>
"Thanks for saving everyone." (Sakurai)<br/>
Sakurai-kun gives his thanks.<br/>
"What happened?" (Makoto)<br/>
The Sun Knight Order is an elite group with everyone having high class professions.<br/>
I don’t think they would have trouble with Mid Floor monsters in Laberintos.<br/>
"Aah, actually, we encountered the Taboo Dragons at the floor down, and ended up in a battle, but…" (Sakurai)<br/>
Looks like the remaining 2 Taboo Dragons are cooperating with each other and are a hard fight.<br/>
They were thinking about separating the two, but even the Low Floor monsters attacked them, and with them having the numerical inferiority, the Taboo Dragons attacked, and they retreated.<br/>
What we saw was after they managed to escape to the Mid Floor.<br/>
"Fortunately, there were no deaths, but this time around we failed…" (Sakurai)<br/>
It is rare to see Sakurai-kun with a dark expression like that.<br/>
"If the observer, the White Great Sage, were to be more cooperative, the situation would have been a lot more different though…" (Yokoyama)<br/>
Yokoyama-san says vexed with a scowl.<br/>
"That person is our insurance for when we fail. We can’t depend on them." (Sakurai)<br/>
Sakurai-kun doesn’t seem to mind it.<br/>
"Eh?! The White Great Sage is here?!" (Lucy)<br/>
Lucy shouts in surprise.<br/>
"Hey, Lucy, the White Great Sage is the one that’s said to be the strongest in the continent?" (Makoto)<br/>
"Heeh, it is rare that Makoto knows." (Lucy)<br/>
I learned this in the temple after all.<br/>
"It can’t be helped, Saki. We were told that we should be the ones to do something about the subjugation of the Taboo Dragons." (Sakurai)<br/>
"But if we were to report that we failed, the Prince Faction will poke at that chance…" (Yokoyama)<br/>
"Yeah, we would be troubling Princess Noel." (Sakurai)<br/>
I don’t know the details of it, but it seems like they are quite troubled.<br/>
Help the Light Hero ←<br/>
Don’t help the Light Hero<br/>
This is that.<br/>
The event where I listen to the Goddess’s request.<br/>
"Sakurai-kun, should I help out?" (Makoto)<br/>
