17-35. Offenses and Defenses at Purple Towers (2)<br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
Satou here. Don't you think situations where allies are made to fight against each others due to false information a relatively common trope in manga and drama? In fictions, it usually gets resolved before it progressed to the worst-case scenario, but I feel like oftentimes, it would just run off toward eventual failures in real world.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
◇<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
"I am Brum Julberg, attendant of past generation hero. I challenge Hero Nanashi to a duel."<br/>
<br/>
Lady Brum made the declaration with her sword pointed at me.<br/>
<br/>
We encountered heroes' troupe as they were just done dealing with monster stampede in front of the world's largest purple tower located near Saga Empire's old capital.<br/>
Apparently they received an oracle from god Parion, with the content, " "Kill the treasonous one who threatens world peace. That is hero Nanashi, avatar of Demon God."<br/>
<br/>
I tried asking Hikaru and she apparently didn't get the oracle.<br/>
<br/>
We don't have time now, perhaps I should put them to sleep and leave clearing the misunderstandings for later?<br/>
<br/>
While I was pondering that, several figures of people stood between me and lady Brum like they were protecting me.<br/>
<br/>
"--Oy, lil' girls. What do you think you're doing?"<br/>
"My wild instinct is telling me this Nanashi is the real deal."<br/>
"Besides, we've been saved so many times by Nanashi and the glittering bunch."<br/>
<br/>
They were the hero Hayato's attendants, tiger-earkin Rusus and wolf-earkin Fifi.<br/>
<br/>
"There is no justice in quarreling between comrades in the face of world crisis."<br/>
"...Loreiya. Even you who should serve god Parion."<br/>
"I may not posses Oracle skill, but I want to believe in my own eyes for discerning whether a being is evil or not."<br/>
<br/>
Priestess Loreiya joined Rusus and Fifi to form a line.<br/>
<br/>
"H-hey wait!"<br/>
"Rusus and Fifi aside, why you too Loreiya-ane!"<br/>
<br/>
Hero Seigi and Hero Yuuki went into panic when they saw that.<br/>
<br/>
"What do you mean by us aside huh?"<br/>
"Is that how you're gonna repay us, after all the drilling we put you two through before coming for the tower?"<br/>
<br/>
Rusus and Fifi glared hard at the two heroes.<br/>
<br/>
"B-but you know! It's not just about the oracle!"<br/>
<br/>
Hero Seigi took one step forward.<br/>
<br/>
"The [Truth Mind's Eye (There's only one truth)] and [Wicked Search (Where bad people at)] I received from Parion-sama tell me... Hero Nanashi is evil, he's definitely and undeniably evil."<br/>
<br/>
Hero Seigi appealed with a half-crying face.<br/>
The three attendants slightly faltered at his teary appeal.<br/>
<br/>
--Apparently, I'm evil.<br/>
<br/>
My unintentional thought seemed to have leaked through Familiar Link, as Arisa clapped my shoulder.<br/>
<br/>
『--Of course not.』<br/>
<br/>
Felt like I could hear Arisa's voice.<br/>
<br/>
"Hero Seigi, what's the basis for that [Evil] condemnation of yours?"<br/>
"Eh? Basis?"<br/>
<br/>
Hero Seigi seemed to find Arisa's question out of left field.<br/>
<br/>
"My Unique Skill tells me. That he's [Evil]."<br/>
"So you're saying [Evil] from god Parion's perspective?"<br/>
<br/>
Arisa who had anticipated hero Seigi's answer nodded once before pointing out that the judgment doesn't come from impartiality but God Parion's subjective opinion.<br/>
<br/>
"I see, so that's how it is."<br/>
"You understand, Rusus?"<br/>
"Naturally of course! It's like [evil coz the god said so]!"<br/>
"I see now!"<br/>
<br/>
Rusus and Fifi had that conversation, but everybody else politely chose to ignore them.<br/>
No wait, Pochi, Tama and Lady Karina are earnestly nodding at them.<br/>
<br/>
『Alrighty, Master, time to tell them how god Parion might have a hand in the theft of Divinity Crystal by Demon God.』<br/>
『No no, that's still a hypothesis at this point.』<br/>
<br/>
It's almost undoubtedly black, but it's still gray at this point.<br/>
Circumstantial evidence doesn't work in the court after all.<br/>
<br/>
"Thanks for waiting! Ookay, looks like we've got a situation here."<br/>
"Loreiya, could you tell us what's going on."<br/>
<br/>
Two attendants of hero Hayato, lady Ringrande and princess Maryest showed up riding a Flying Wooden Horse.<br/>
<br/>
"We received an oracle from god Parion telling us that hero Nanashi is a minion of Demon God."<br/>
""--I see.""<br/>
<br/>
The two nodded at Loreiya's concise explanation.<br/>
<br/>
"Brum-basan, sorry but could you sheathe your sword please?"<br/>
"Ringrande, missy, you're going to take his side too?"<br/>
"Yup. That's what Hayato asked me to, and besides, fighting him is a pointless endeavor."<br/>
"--Pointless?"<br/>
<br/>
Lady Brum's wrinkled face frowned when she heard Lady Ringrande.<br/>
<br/>
"You heard me, there would be three fresh corpses right about now had hero Nanashi willed it."<br/>
"Even if that is the truth, I'll be sure to pay back in kind."<br/>
"Nope, never gonna work. Even if there's 100 Brum-basan, it's just impossible. Of course that applies to like 1000 of us too."<br/>
"Doesn't matter if it's impossible or pointless, there are things you have to do no matter what in this world."<br/>
<br/>
Looks like lady Brum has no intention to withdraw here.<br/>
Her brawn over brain side really reminds me of her son, Zeff Julberg, the leader of Shiga Eight Swords.<br/>
<br/>
"I understand. Let's do this."<br/>
<br/>
--We don't have time.<br/>
<br/>
"Hang on, Nanashi!"<br/>
『Don't worry, I won't kill her.』<br/>
<br/>
I replied back to the panicking Lady Ringrande through Space Magic [Telephone].<br/>
<br/>
"So I'll be up against Brum-san, and two heroes then?"<br/>
"Yeah, that's right."<br/>
<br/>
I fetch a self-made holy sword from Storage and take a stance.<br/>
<br/>
"H-hold on! I can't fight at this range, I'm telling you!"<br/>
"Hear hear! And I just used my [Sword of Condemnation (Justice always win)] on some big ones earlier, gotta wait for the cooldown!"<br/>
<br/>
Lady Brum glanced at the two panicking heroes and clicked her tongue.<br/>
<br/>
"Very well, I'll go at it by myself! --Magic Slash."<br/>
<br/>
Lady Brum unleashed a blade-drawing killing stroke from Ground Shrink, but after all the countless high speed mock battle against beastkin girls I had, I could probably dodge her attack with my eyes closed now.<br/>
<br/>
I took the sword with my Mana Clad hand and crushed it in my hand.<br/>
<br/>
"--Wha."<br/>
<br/>
Lady Brum immediately discarded her sword and attempted to take a spare magic sword from her Item Box while stepping back using Flickering Motion, but I'm not obliged to let it slide.<br/>
I closed in on her using Ground Shrink and lightly jabbed her chin to knock her out.<br/>
<br/>
I also made her fall asleep using Sleep magic and stopped her from moving with Paralyzing magic.<br/>
<br/>
I held the unconscious lady Brum with psychokinetic-like [Magic Hand] and delivered her to the two heroes.<br/>
<br/>
"Hero Nanashi, are you going to destroy this tower too?"<br/>
<br/>
I give my affirmation to princess Maryest.<br/>
<br/>
"Oh right, you two helped getting the emperor's approval, didn't you? Thanksies."<br/>
<br/>
I used ventriloquism to make my voice only be heard by Princess Maryest and her companions so the girls on my camp wouldn't hear my Nanashi speech pattern.<br/>
<br/>
> Title [Magician of Sound] Acquired.<br/>
<br/>
Whoa, been so long since my last title.<br/>
<br/>
The two girls were chuckling for some reason.<br/>
<br/>
--Oh right, these two have already figure out the real identity of Hero Nanashi (me) and the girls.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<TLN: If you're reading this novel at any other site than Sousetsuka .com you might be reading an unedited, uncorrected version of the novel.><br/>
◇<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
"UWAAAAAAAAAAAA!"<br/>
"OUUUUUUUUUUUCH!"<br/>
<br/>
While I was feeling awkward, the two heroes screamed out while jerking weirdly.<br/>
Blue lights flashed out of the two heroes' bodies, red flames are dancing around hero Yuuki's arms.<br/>
<br/>
Hero Yuuki unleashed warhead missile-like rains of flame balls, but all of it landed far from us, spreading explosions around.<br/>
Hero Seigi came slashing at me with his sword clad in blue light--most likely his Unique Skill [Sword of Condemnation], however, on top of bending back, he was obviously trying to keep the sword away from hitting me.<br/>
<br/>
"N-not good. Dodge it!"<br/>
<br/>
Hero Seigi's holy sword suddenly changed its trajectory, heading toward me, but since it was even slower than lady Brum's attack, dodging it was a simple matter.<br/>
<br/>
"Are you being controlled!?"<br/>
"Most likely!"<br/>
"My body is moving on its own!"<br/>
<br/>
After I listened to the two's answers, I knocked them out, put them in Sleep and Paralyze magic combo and laid them next to lady Brum.<br/>
<br/>
『Hikaru, how are you faring?』<br/>
『Un, doesn't feel like I'm being controlled or anything. I think it's thanks to the functions built into this armor.』<br/>
<br/>
I was worried it for a second there since Hikaru is [Parion's Hero] like the two, it was thankfully unfounded.<br/>
<br/>
Just in case, I put the two heroes in newly developed golden armors installed with anti mind control circuits.<br/>
I could have just left them here, but it would be bad if they got eaten by vanguard monsters coming out of the tower, so I forcefully sent them to the old capital's gate using space magic teleport.<br/>
<br/>
"I wonder just what is Parion-sama trying to accomplish..."<br/>
<br/>
Priestess Loreiya murmured in melancholy.<br/>
<br/>
"Let's go ask the her personally then. Besides, there's no guarantee this was all Parion-sama's doing."<br/>
<br/>
Lady Ringrande clasped priestess Loreiya's shoulder before walking toward me.<br/>
<br/>
"Are you going straight to destroying the tower now?"<br/>
"No, I've got to close the gate to the Netherworld at the top of the tower before that."<br/>
<br/>
Or more correctly, I'm gonna seal the path that connects to the Netherworld--and if possible, the entire Netherworld.<br/>
I'm sure not even Demon God could so easily dispatch his armies once he lost access to the low cost route.<br/>
<br/>
"We're going with you too."<br/>
"That's unnecessary."<br/>
"Please don't say that. Let us help you thin out the mob up to upper floors as an apology for causing you problems."<br/>
<br/>
Well, I guess I don't mind.<br/>
Most of these girls work well as advance and rear attackers, so they're just right to complement the silver members.<br/>
<br/>
Once we decided on the formation, we set foot in the tower.<br/>
<br/>
I put a seal on the entrance just like with all other towers.<br/>
<br/>
"Is that a seal? Won't we get in big trouble if we found ourselves unable to escape out in a pickle?"<br/>
"It'll be fine. The seal has been made to allow people escape outside from the inside."<br/>
<br/>
Although there should be none now, this seal can deal with any old capital's adventurer who's still inside.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
◇<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
"Here we go, Right Wing."<br/>
"I got it, Left Wing."<br/>
<br/>
Shiro (Right Wing) and Crow (Left Wing) flew up while leaving trails of glittering lights from their silver armor as they rushed toward a swarm of vanguard monsters.<br/>
<br/>
They've been boosted with Zena-san's Unique Skill and wind magic fusion [Saint Army] and an advanced level force magic I and Hikaru created, [Hero Play].<br/>
<br/>
""--Wings Dance <<Twin Feather Dance>>""<br/>
<br/>
The innumerable little specks surrounding them leave any monsters in their wake full of wounds.<br/>
It's a new technique developed thanks to the feedback I got from the development of Zena-san's stiletto.<br/>
<br/>
"Damn, those wingkin kids are awesome."<br/>
"We ain't gonna lose to them."<br/>
"Let's go, Fifi!"<br/>
"Ou!"<br/>
<br/>
Rusus and Fifi took care of monsters that had managed to escape Shiro and Crow without any waste in movement.<br/>
<br/>
"Shield Golem Unit, maintain the path those four have opened!"<br/>
<br/>
Princess Sistina followed after the four together with her Golem army.<br/>
<br/>
『Hey, hey, Master. Won't it be faster if Master uses your Unique Skill to get us straight to the top floor?』<br/>
『This tower's structure has changed somehow, the floor information I got from my last investigation has been reset, you see.』<br/>
<br/>
To be precise, the Map has been replaced with a new one.<br/>
It'd be faster if I went ahead using Flash Drive and then summon everyone once I got to the top floor, but I'd feel bad if I took all the stage for myself.<br/>
Hence, we're conquering the tower the old way while also using this opportunity to level up silver members.<br/>
<br/>
We should reach the topmost floor by the end of the day at this pace anyway.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
◇<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
"Phiw~?"<br/>
"Can't move anymore."<br/>
"Good job nanodesu. You two were great nodesuyo."<br/>
<br/>
Pochi brought with her fruit juice and deep fried donut as a reward for Shiro and Crow who went limp right after they broke through the lower floors.<br/>
Our advance guard right now is consisted of Rusus and Fifi guarded by golem army, and also Lady Karina.<br/>
<br/>
"KUNGFU RANBUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUU"<br/>
<br/>
Assisted by Raka, Lady Karina are overwhelming the monsters prowling these mid floors.<br/>
<br/>
"Well dang, that's some wicked moves on top of those huge tits."<br/>
"--More like, I'm surprised those things don't get sore with how intense she moves around."<br/>
<br/>
Rusus aside, Fifi's point of shock is a bit off target.<br/>
Lady Karina's silver armor is an ambitious work of mine, a successful marriage between defensive power of armor and the flexibility of breast holders. You could even say it's the best possible equipment for her.<br/>
<br/>
"You missed a few of them. ■■ Quick Burst."<br/>
<br/>
Lady Ringrande used a quick-to-execute spell to halt a big vanguard monster's march before cutting up its shin with her magic edge-clad magic sword.<br/>
<br/>
"Mary!"<br/>
"■■■■■ <<Lightning Penetrate>>!"<br/>
<br/>
Princess Maryest let loose an advanced level lightning magic with an unbelievably short cast time.<br/>
Her penetrating lightning pierced through the big vanguard monster's barrier and shot through its eyeball.<br/>
<br/>
--ＰＳＹＣＬＯＯＯＯＯＯＯＯＯＯＺＰ.<br/>
<br/>
The monster fell down the ground.<br/>
Cloud of dust rose from gaps between stone paving along with a tremor.<br/>
<br/>
"Both Mary person and Rin person, you two are amazing nodesu!"<br/>
<br/>
At Pochi's frank compliment, lady Ringrande brushed her hair backward, looking not at all dissatisfied with it.<br/>
Behind her, the big vanguard monster's fist was swinging at her back.<br/>
<br/>
"<<RECITE>> Sacred Attendants! ■■■ <<Sacred Javelin>>"<br/>
<br/>
[Sacred Attendants] deployed by Sera resonated with her mid-level magic, pulverizing the giant fist that was coming for lady Ringrande.<br/>
<br/>
"You're your own worst enemy. Ane-sama."<br/>
"Impressive, Sera. Mine Bomber."<br/>
<br/>
The delayed activation spell recited by lady Ringrande finished the big vanguard monster off.<br/>
Sera actually introduced herself as Silver Knight Holy, but that probably held no meaning considering they had realized our identity.<br/>
<br/>
"I suppose that was meddlesome of me?"<br/>
"Not at all, I'm happy I could bear witness to my little sister's love."<br/>
"It's nothing like love. I only helped because it would trouble us if you get hurt."<br/>
"Oh? Okay then, let's leave it at that."<br/>
<br/>
Lady Ringrande grinned from ear to ear under her helmet when she saw Sera turning her face away to hide her embarrassment.<br/>
<br/>
"Well now that I've been charged full of love, anything unfortunate enough to stand before me?"<br/>
<br/>
While cheerily skipping ahead, Lady Ringrande went on to slaughter vanguard monsters that had escaped the frontline with a combination of explosion magic and sword techniques.<br/>
<br/>
"Uwaa, I feel sorry for these monsters."<br/>
"Geez, that girl is just..."<br/>
"Oh she'll run out of steam and fall back before long."<br/>
<br/>
Following Arisa, princess Maryest and Loreiya murmured words that sounded like they're astonished and have already gotten used to this.<br/>
<br/>
"Zena-tan, Mary-tan, swarms of monsters incoming from both sides."<br/>
<br/>
Arisa warned the rear guard.<br/>
<br/>
"Thanks for the assist, Red. --Tempest."<br/>
"...■■■■ Thunder Hell (Keraunos)."<br/>
<br/>
Zena-san with her delayed activation magic and Princess Maryest that was done reciting her spell cast magic that decimated the monster swarm in one go.<br/>
<br/>
"...■■ Burst Brave."<br/>
<br/>
With Loreiya's magic, attendants and those who bear the title of Hero get a power up.<br/>
It's apparently a sacred magic only handed down at Hero Faction of the Old Capital Parion Temple.<br/>
<br/>
The magic had absolutely no effect on me, but it strengthened princess Maryest and lady Ringrande in addition to rapidly recovering their used up mana. Quite a convenient magic.<br/>
It consumes a lot of miss Loreiya's mana though, so she can't use it too often.<br/>
<br/>
『Found the path above~?』<br/>
『Good going, Tama.』<br/>
『Nihehe~?』<br/>
<br/>
After getting a report from Tama who was in charge of surveying routes, I called back the golden members led by Liza who were in charge of demolishing the floor monsters.<br/>
The returning Tama and the house-sitting Pochi exchanged a high five.<br/>
<br/>
We left middle floors, reaching upper floors.<br/>
<br/>
"Looks like Evil Dragons gonna start spawning from this point on."<br/>
<br/>
At the end of Arisa's line of sight, a fierce fight is unfolding between an <<Evil Vanguard Dragon>> and the combined team of silver members and attendants.<br/>
<br/>
"Keep at it~"<br/>
"There! Over there nanodesu!"<br/>
"Aa, watch out!"<br/>
<br/>
The girls are on the edge of their seats as they watch over the fight against Evil Dragon.<br/>
<br/>
"Master, requesting permission to help."<br/>
"No can do."<br/>
<br/>
Besides support magic, we will only help them when it's looking bad or if they call for help. <br/>
Lady Karina has just got blown away, but I believe she would get back to the frontline unharmed.<br/>
<br/>
"One more push!"<br/>
"Over there desu!"<br/>
"Keepie."<br/>
<br/>
At the end of almost an hour fight, the Evil Vanguard Dragon finally breathed its last.<br/>
<br/>
"That was a close one, wasn't it."<br/>
<br/>
The advance and center guard members have their equipment in tatter, nearly half of the shield golems are lost.<br/>
The rear guard members are unharmed but they've completely run out of mana.<br/>
<br/>
"These Demidragon Vanguards are really on a whole other level."<br/>
<br/>
Lady Ringrande took off her helmet and wiped her sweat.<br/>
<br/>
"Feel like I can even beat a true dragon now."<br/>
"Ahaha, why don't we give it a try later."<br/>
<br/>
Rusus and Fifi bumped their fists while smiling even while laying helplessly on the floor.<br/>
That was quite an enhancing combat.<br/>
<br/>
"The next ones are coming~?"<br/>
"Next ones?"<br/>
"Is it a manticore this time?"<br/>
<br/>
At Tama's warning, Rusus and Fifi asked back listlessly.<br/>
<br/>
"Nuh uh nodesuyo. It's a swarm of evil dragons nanodesu."<br/>
"Swarm?"<br/>
"of evil dragons?"<br/>
"Yes nanodesu. You can tell from the vibrations on the ground nodesuyo."<br/>
<br/>
As told by Pochi, Rusus and Fifi put their ears on the ground.<br/>
<br/>
"Geh, for real."<br/>
"This ain't gonna work. Let's run away."<br/>
<br/>
Before the pale faced two, Pochi and Tama shook their fingers in front of their faces while saying, 'Chicchicchi.'<br/>
<br/>
Looks like they learned that from Arisa when she did it last time.<br/>
Please stop adapting these weird gestures from her.<br/>
<br/>
"You can let Pochi (Yellow) and friends take care of the rest nodesuyo."<br/>
"It's Tama (Pink)'s turn~?"<br/>
<br/>
Now then, time for Golden members to shine.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
