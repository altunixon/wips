When the Waifu is away…<br/>
Chapter 173: A Shield to Protect the Shield<br/>
A few days passed. The days passed way too peacefully.<br/>
The only problems I have to attend to are the maintenance of the neighboring village and Rat’s Bioplant modifications.<br/>
And Melty is helping out a lot with the village.<br/>
But this seems to be largely due to her subordinates, who are well versed in politics.<br/>
There is no tax as of now, but we will have to levy one in the near future.<br/>
For now the villagers must focus on restoration.<br/>
And, without saying, the villagers happily agreed to that matter.<br/>
Melty sometimes acts older than her age, but other times acts like a brat.<br/>
But after that assassination attempt I guess this village is one of the few places she can be at ease.<br/>
The Queen? I don’t consider her an enemy, but she’s not a person I should trust so easily.<br/>
The accessory merchant somehow opened a shop without me even noticing.<br/>
Because the shield is supposed to be the guardian of Demi-Humans, the bars are usually filled with Demi-Human adventurers.<br/>
We’re relying on soldiers for security now, but after reconstruction finishes, I guess I can pass the task on to anyone with free time.<br/>
There are still too few slaves to start a village.<br/>
Should I go to the Slave Dealer again?<br/>
By the way, on the day he got back, Fohl was dragged off by Firo, and forcefully had his level raised to 18.<br/>
When he got back, he collapsed. To gain so many levels in an hour may have been too much for his body to handle.<br/>
"I’m leveling up quite fast." (Fohl)<br/>
"It’s probably due to Firo. She can run at an amazing speed taking down all monsters on the way." (Naofumi)<br/>
"Y-you’re mistaken… The Usapills just gave much more experience than usual." (Fohl)<br/>
"Is that so?" (Naofumi)<br/>
"Yeah, I don’t know why, but the numbers were definitely higher than when I had to fight them a long time ago." (Fohl)<br/>
Fumu… It’s possible that Hero companions get more experience than other adventurers.<br/>
Why wasn’t I told this earlier?<br/>
Would anyone even notice unless they reset their level?<br/>
No, the other heroes may have been able to figure it out from other adventurers… but I’m not really in a situation where I can converse with them normally.<br/>
The slaves in my possession saw such EXP from the beginning, so they couldn’t find anything off.<br/>
I’ll ask Sadina about it later.<br/>
"I’m home~!" (Sadina)<br/>
Sadina appears carrying a large quantity of fish.<br/>
The villagers surround me in high tensions, as if to demand that I cook for them.<br/>
Since things have been going well as of late, I guess I’ll do it.<br/>
"The Hero of the Shield’s power is amazing. I get more EXP and my stats rise higher." (Sadina)<br/>
"So that really was the case." (Naofumi)<br/>
I guess the EXP bonus is a default setting of being a Hero.<br/>
It’s not specific to the shield. Otherwise Rishia would have noticed.<br/>
And so night fell.<br/>
"I’m back!" (Kiel)<br/>
"I have returned." (Atlas)<br/>
"KYUA!" (Gaelion)<br/>
Kiel’s party returns from hunting.<br/>
The party consists of Kiel, Atlas, Taniko and Gaelion.<br/>
It seems that Kiel is the main fighting force.<br/>
When Fohl isn’t frantically leveling with Firo, he also joins them.<br/>
But with this team, I see the balance of powers shifting away from Kiel soon.<br/>
"You took a while today." (Naofumi)<br/>
"It took a while to feed Gaelion-chan." (Taniko)<br/>
So they fed him before they got back.<br/>
Gaelion’s neck is growing longer, while the rest of his body remains the same.<br/>
His evolution is heading in an ominous direction…<br/>
"I made dinner, so eat it and sleep." (Naofumi)<br/>
"Niichan’s home-made?" (Kiel)<br/>
"Yeah." (Naofumi)<br/>
"Hooray!" (Kiel)<br/>
Kiel seems happy.<br/>
Again, I question whether my food really is that tasty.<br/>
The shield’s effects are in place, but I wonder about my actual cooking skill. It’s probably raised as well with all the experience I’m getting.<br/>
"The food Naofumi makes is superb." (Atlas)<br/>
"… yeah." (Taniko)<br/>
Even Taniko nods. The Shield is amazing.<br/>
Anyways, I take out food for Kiel’s party and return to my house.<br/>
Wait. Where is Rafatalia?<br/>
… Ah right.<br/>
Rafatalia and Rishia are off doing training with the Granny in the mountains.<br/>
Firo went off to sleep with Melty.<br/>
It’s been a while since I’ve found myself Alone.<br/>
I guess I should put more work into making sellable medicine.<br/>
I need to teach some Lemos as well.<br/>
Kon. Kon. I hear a knock on the door.<br/>
Who could it be? It’s the middle of the night.<br/>
I open the door.<br/>
… No one’s there.<br/>
Was it my imagination?<br/>
I close it and return to my work.<br/>
… There’s another knock.<br/>
I once again open it to find the doorway empty.<br/>
Is someone trying to play a prank?<br/>
And so… Kon. Kon.<br/>
"Who is it! Who’s trying to incur my wrath!?" (Naofumi)<br/>
"Eh? Wrath… is it?" (Atlas)<br/>
Atlas stares at me with a blank expression.<br/>
"You’re not the one trying to annoy me, right?" (Naofumi)<br/>
"This is the first time I knocked…" (Atlas)<br/>
"What are you doing here at this hour?" (Naofumi)<br/>
"That is… um… Can I sleep with you?" (Atlas)<br/>
"Don’t you share a house with your brother?" (Naofumi)<br/>
If I handle this poorly, I think Fohl will get annoying.<br/>
I’d like to avoid trouble.<br/>
"Onii-sama is currently out cold. So until I fall asleep, can you please keep me company?" (Atlas)<br/>
Out cold… was it blunt force trauma?<br/>
No, I don’t think this pure girl would do such a thing.<br/>
I’m fine with talking with her, but sleeping together is a bit…<br/>
I find it hard to sleep around Rafatalia. My eyes sometimes fly open in the middle of the night.<br/>
Though Rafatalia herself seems to sleep just fine.<br/>
It might be due to my own Trauma, but I get a bad feeling whenever I’m sleeping in the same room as a woman.<br/>
I want to decline if possible.<br/>
"Rejected." (Naofumi)<br/>
"Then I shall sleep in front of Naofumi-sama’s house." (Atlas)<br/>
"Why?" (Naofumi)<br/>
What’s she up to?<br/>
She’s acting strange.<br/>
"There’s no choice. You can sleep in Rafatalia’s bed." (Naofumi)<br/>
"Understood." (Atlas)<br/>
Rafatalia is out, so we have an extra bed. I let her inside.<br/>
… I’m a little worried about Fohl’s situation.<br/>
When Atlas falls asleep, I’ll go check it out.<br/>
I lead Atlas to Rafatalia’s bed, and tuck her in.<br/>
"Is Naofumi-sama not going to sleep?" (Atlas)<br/>
"Yeah, I have to work on making medicine." (Naofumi)<br/>
Medicine always sells well. If I leave all the work to the shield, the production speed is too slow.<br/>
I’ll have to earnestly teach some villagers medicine making soon as well.<br/>
This village needs a set, steady source of income in order to expand.<br/>
I’ve begun selling some to the Apothecary in the neighboring village, but my stocks are limited.<br/>
Though Rat’s bioplants have started being able to produce herbs, producing the medicine itself seems impossible. I could sell the herbs whole, but that severely drops the price. I also don’t want to risk anything, so I want the plants to be processed beforehand. I have high poison resistance.<br/>
With the shield, I can judge whether or not a plant is poisonous, and I can handle them regardless.<br/>
"Naofumi-sama sure is a busy one." (Atlas)<br/>
"I’m only doing it for the money." (Naofumi)<br/>
"But… Because of your hard work I can now walk." (Atlas)<br/>
"…" (Naofumi)<br/>
I was only calculating loss and gain. Don’t mistake it for good will.<br/>
But Atlas seems to have found confirmation of her statement in my silence.<br/>
Keeping up with this girl is… difficult.<br/>
Like Rafatalia, she isn’t pushing any ideals onto me, but is treating all of my actions as positive.<br/>
If I told her to do something now, I’m pretty sure she would do it without question. How scary.<br/>
Though she’s just a kid.<br/>
This is bad… Isn’t it dangerous to be alone at night with that sort of person?<br/>
A shiver goes down my spine.<br/>
"Naofumi-sama." (Atlas)<br/>
"W-what is it?" (Naofumi)<br/>
"Rafatalia told me that because you couldn’t fight, she became your sword." (Atlas)<br/>
"Pretty much." (Naofumi)<br/>
The only thing I can do is protect.<br/>
This is the Shield’s ability. One that hasn’t changed since I got to this world.<br/>
The only exception is Counter effects, and the Wrath Shield.<br/>
The Frisbee shield was a shield that let me throw Frisbee-like projectiles.<br/>
Now I can finally attack! I got really excited, and tried to throw one at a monster but as expected it fell onto the ground upon impact without dealing damage.<br/>
Now it’s completely become a toy to play with Firo and the other monsters.<br/>
After it’s been caught it disappears and returns to my hand.<br/>
"Rafatalia is working hard for my sake. I depend on her a lot." (Naofumi)<br/>
To fight the Wave. To save the world. Rafatalia really is working hard.<br/>
When I look at her, I feel motivated as well.<br/>
Rafatalia is the person I trust the most in this world.<br/>
(TL: Taken out of context, this sounds…)<br/>
Everyone else seems to have hidden intentions.<br/>
(TL: No, dat girl has plenty of hidden intentions)<br/>
"Because I am the Hero of the Shield, The only thing this world lets me do is defend." (Naofumi)<br/>
"… I know. When I look at this village, I see that everyone is being protected under Naofumi-sama’s wings." (Atlas)<br/>
"Wings…" (Naofumi)<br/>
So I’m like a mother bird, protecting the chicks under its wings.<br/>
And that would make this my nest.<br/>
"If all you do is protect, everyone will someday leave your nest." (Atlas)<br/>
"Anyone that wants to leave can leave, and still I will protect this village." (Naofumi)<br/>
This is Rafatalia’s homeland.<br/>
As long as I restore this land, she will be able to live on when I’m gone.<br/>
Even if I return to my world, she has people like Sadina and Kiel.<br/>
Firo has Melty, and Atlas has Fohl. This village won’t fall so easily. And the inhabitants here should be able to take care of whoever tries to attack, be it a country or an army.<br/>
"But then… Who will protect Naofumi-sama?" (Atlas)<br/>
"Wha?" (Naofumi)<br/>
What are you saying? Why must I be protected?<br/>
Why would she direct that at me?<br/>
What point is there in protecting the Shield Hero?<br/>
"After coming to this village, I have heard all about Naofumi-sama’s exploits. You… did amazing work. No matter what adversity you faced, you overcame it and persevered." (Atlas)<br/>
"Y-yeah… I see. I did receive a promotion too." (Naofumi)<br/>
"However, who is going to protect you, Naofumi-sama?" (Atlas)<br/>
"… It’s not like I’m not protected." (Naofumi)<br/>
Rafatalia, Firo, Melty and even the Queen. If I ever get in trouble, I think that they would try to save me.<br/>
"This is what I think. If Rafatalia is Naofumi-sama’s sword, then perhaps I could become Naofumi-sama’s shield." (Atlas)<br/>
"Shield.. That’s not as easy as it sounds, you know." (Naofumi)<br/>
It doesn’t feel good to become someone elses shield.<br/>
And I see no need for protection.<br/>
I’ve gone through painful experiences, but if I mulled over them I would never be able to achieve victory, and I would just sink further into depression.<br/>
Becoming my Shield is quite a goal.<br/>
It’s probably because from the moment she was born, she had to be protected by other.<br/>
She wants to be the one to protect someone.<br/>
If my right arm is Rafatalia, then she wants to become the left.<br/>
However… I get an uneasy feeling when she says this.<br/>
"That sort of thing is something you should say after you get strong." (Naofumi)<br/>
"Yes. I swear it to you that I will get strong." (Atlas)<br/>
"Good luck." (Naofumi)<br/>
Atlas’s breathing calms down. She starts to fall asleep.<br/>
She sure has developed a strange goal…<br/>
If Fohl heard about it, he would probably get quite angry.<br/>
I carry Atlas and head over to her and Fohl’s house.<br/>
… He’s really sleeping.<br/>
"…Oy." (Naofumi)<br/>
"ZZZ…" (Fohl)<br/>
"ZZZ? This isn’t a manga! Get up!" (Naofumi)<br/>
"Wha!?" (Fohl)<br/>
After putting Atlas in her bed, I wake Fohl up and take him outside to talk.<br/>
"Look after your sister properly. She came and said she wanted to sleep with me." (Naofumi)<br/>
"W-what!? Then… Atlas has already been…" (Fohl)<br/>
He glares at me as if I had insulted his ancestors. His slave crest begins to glow.<br/>
"Who would do anything to that brat?" (Naofumi)<br/>
"Are you saying my Atlas has no charm as a woman!?" (Fohl)<br/>
"For the love of… This is a pain! I really just have no interest in that!" (Naofumi)<br/>
"Liar!" (Fohl)<br/>
These siblings really are troublesome.<br/>
Though I say that…<br/>
To want to become my shield… what a strange child.<br/>
<br/>
