According to http://strawpoll.me/2634567/r It is safe to say that the chocobos will stay as Philorials. <br/>

Chapter 68 <br/>
 <br/>
Battle Between Shield and Spear <br/>
 <br/>
"Firo, You take Motoyasu-" <br/>
 <br/>
I give Firo instructions as the battle begins. <br/>
Motoyasu cannot lay a hand on women. Especially Firo, Motoyasu even hesitates to point his spear at her. <br/>
Even if Motoyasu was able to attack Firo properly,she would be able to stop the spear. <br/>
 <br/>
"I am the queen who commands the origin of power. I have read and deciphered a law of nature. Rain flames upon my enemies!" <br/>
"Tzuvait ・Fire Squall!" <br/>
 <br/>
The arrogant bitch sings an aria and casts Fire system magic. <br/>
 <br/>
"Naofumi! Firo-chan!" <br/>
 <br/>
"I am one who commands the origin of power. I have read and deciphered a law of nature. Hinder the rain of flames that pours on us!" <br/>
"Anti ・Tzuvait ・Fire Squall!" <br/>
 <br/>
Melty instantly counterbalances the intermediate magic that the bitch chants before going back to work on the cage. <br/>
However, she could not perfectly counterbalance it and the rain of fire still poured towards us. <br/>
Fortunately, it only hit Firo and I who were in front. <br/>
The jungle is set ablaze. <br/>
The area nearby instantly becomes a sea of flames. <br/>
Many villagers start to panic as the fire spreads. <br/>
 <br/>
"I will not forgive you for kicking Motoyasu-sama so many times." <br/>
 <br/>
The bitch is casting magic towards us seriously. <br/>
Melty is good at magic, but she is pretty good too. <br/>
There is a big difference between the bitch and Melty known as Levels, due to her being in Motoyasu's party. <br/>
 <br/>
"Firo, Are you okay!?" <br/>
"Yep. I'm fine-" <br/>
 <br/>
Firo doesn't seem affected by the rain of fire. <br/>
Well...... during the first wave I also barely felt anything when the knights barraged the area with magic. <br/>
But the biggest problem now is the surrounding Bio plants which have been set ablaze. <br/>
What kind of dumbass uses fire magic inside a jungle? Are you even thinking about your surroundings? <br/>
 <br/>
 <br/>
"I am one who commands the origin of power. I have read and deciphered a law of nature. Bless us with the rain we eagerly long for!" <br/>
"Tzuvait ・Squall!" <br/>
 <br/>
Melty directs her magic towards the jungle while Raphtalia protects her. <br/>
 <br/>
"Mein, Thank you." <br/>
 <br/>
Motoyasu who received the bitch's help shows his gratitude by giving her a thumbs up. <br/>
Everything this guy does is infuriating. <br/>
 <br/>
"Now! Motoyasu-sama please concentrate onto the devil of the shield! We'll hold that damned bird back with magic!" <br/>
 <br/>
Under bitch's comand Motoyasu's subordinates begins to chant. <br/>
 <br/>
"Here I come-!" <br/>
 <br/>
Firo ignores the chanting and charges straight at Motoyasu. <br/>
 <br/>
"Wait Firo--" <br/>
 <br/>
I don't understand what they are doing, but charging recklessly is not going to help! <br/>
 <br/>
"Wing ・Tackle!" <br/>
 <br/>
Firo tries to tackle Motoyasu with her giant body coated in wind. <br/>
 <br/>
"Fube---" <br/>
 <br/>
As a result, Firo is blown off while spinning, she unfurls her wings to make a landing. <br/>
 <br/>
"That was surprising. But, here I go!" <br/>
 <br/>
Firo charges at Motoyasu again without learning her lesson. However, I have no idea as to what magic it was that Blew Firo off again. <br/>
This is not a feasible combat strategy. <br/>
While Firo is being pinned down, Motoyasu rushes at me-- <br/>
 <br/>
"Eat this Naofumi! Meteor Spear!" <br/>
 <br/>
Motoyasu's spear shines brilliantly as shouts and leaps. <br/>
The energy condenses to cover his spear as it heads towards me. <br/>
 <br/>
"Guu......!?" <br/>
 <br/>
I receive the attack with the thickest part of my shield. <br/>
Through the shield I receive a heavy blow that affects my whole body. <br/>
I'm guessing that was a finisher move. <br/>
Well, there is no reason to hold back in a real fight. <br/>
All the bones in my body groan under the pressure. <br/>
I think this is the worst attack yet. <br/>
Glass's attack wasn't as heavy thanks to the shield of anger. <br/>
 <br/>
"How's that! There's still more! Disorder Piercing! Rising Dragon Spear!" <br/>
(Tl note: SHORYUSPEAR) <br/>
 <br/>
Motoyasu unleashes his skills continuously. I fire the special ability of the Chimeric Viper Shield, Snake's poison fang. <br/>
Shit...... It's not effective because his level is too high! <br/>
An intense pain could be felt from the attack that I failed to block. <br/>
I understand that I'm bleeding even without looking. <br/>
Recover magic..... But Motoyasu won't give me the room to heal. <br/>
 <br/>
"Shield Prison!" <br/>
 <br/>
I trap Motoyasu within a cage of shields. <br/>
 <br/>
"Giant Windmill!" <br/>
 <br/>
Motoyasu swings his spear around like a baton, and cuts down the shields that I summon. <br/>
Damn...... His offensive power has already greatly exceeded my defensive power. <br/>
Whenever a cool down is off I cast a skill. <br/>
As expected there is no chance to win in a defensive fight. <br/>
What do I do...... <br/>
Firo can't even get close to Motoyasu thanks to the bitch and her subordinates. <br/>
 <br/>
"Firo commands the origin of power. Firo has read and deciphered a law of nature. Blow her away with a raging tornado!" <br/>
"Tzuvait ・Tornado!" <br/>
 <br/>
"I am the queen who commands the origin of power. I have read and deciphered a law of nature. The Tornado shall disperse and disappear!" <br/>
""I am one who commands the origin of power. I have read and deciphered a law of nature. The Tornado shall disperse and disappear!"" <br/>
"""Anti ・Tzuvait ・Tornado!" <br/>
 <br/>
The magic that Firo casts overpowers the counterbalancing of three people and breaks through, but it loses a lot of power. <br/>
 <br/>
"Yaay, Here I go~" <br/>
"Wing ・Tackle!" <br/>
 <br/>
Firo tries to take advantage of the situation and charges Motoyasu immediately. but, she is blown off again. <br/>
This is......looking bleak. <br/>
It seems those three are well prepared against Firo, and have taken measures in advance. <br/>
 <br/>
Motoyasu you bastard, I really want to kill you. <br/>
Fortunately Raphtalia and Melty were excluded as targets. <br/>
Are they looking down on use because we lack the power to kill them? <br/>
Perhaps if Raphtalia joined the fight, and Firo was not being suppressed. <br/>
It is evident that it requires three people, and they are barely stopping Firo. <br/>
 <br/>
Melty's speciality is magic. It would be possible to counterbalance, but her Level is too low. <br/>
I told Raphtalia not to step in because of her lack of armour. <br/>
No wait, if I approach together with Firo I should be able to hold back their magic. <br/>
At this point both bitch's magical power and my physical strength is starting to decline. <br/>
 <br/>
"Hm!?" <br/>
 <br/>
Bitch and her lackeys drink something. <br/>
Is that possibly a potion that recovers magical power? <br/>
Dangerous......I don't think we can hold out until they run out of potions. <br/>
 <br/>
"What a tough guy. Thanks to the shield's skills he will not to fall down......" <br/>
 <br/>
Motoyasu seems to be out of breath as he continues using skills. I have also received considerable damage! <br/>
I feel blood dripping from my body. <br/>
 <br/>
"I received good information and gotten strong in a different way." <br/>
 <br/>
So far, after coming to this world, everything has been developed through trail and error. <br/>
I did not choose the means of becoming strong. <br/>
Avariciously, I stacked equipment bonuses of unsealed shields. <br/>
Nonetheless......I am still unable to win? <br/>
 <br/>
"Kyaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa!" <br/>
"What's going on!?" <br/>
 <br/>
Motoyasu got distracted. One of his companions cried out. <br/>
I follow Motoyasu's line of sight and check. <br/>
One of Motoyasu's companions had a sword piercing her shoulder from behind. <br/>
Melty was considered too weak, and since Raphtalia was on defence she was ignored. <br/>
 <br/>
"You are only paying attention to Firo, there are too many openings!" <br/>
 <br/>
Raphtalia's figure suddenly appears. <br/>
 <br/>
"You!" <br/>
 <br/>
After her companion was stabbed, the bitch brandishes her sword and slashes. <br/>
 <br/>
"Hide ・Mirage" <br/>
 <br/>
When Raphtalia was about to be stabbed she disappeared like smoke. <br/>
Raphtalia used concealment magic that uses a magic sword skill to produce a phantom, hence Hide ・Mirage. <br/>
It appears to be concealment magic that utilizes illusions. <br/>
 <br/>
"Do not get carried away with mere illusion magic!" <br/>
 <br/>
"I am the queen who commands the origin of power. I have read and deciphered a law of nature. Cut down the illusions!" <br/>
"Wind Flasher!" <br/>
 <br/>
The illusion magic Raphtalia was using to hide disappears. Raphtalia emerged from the mist that the wind cut down. <br/>
 <br/>
"There!" <br/>
 <br/>
The bitch thrusts towards Raphtalia. <br/>
Raphtalia......is receiving the attack!? <br/>
Rapthalia has no armour. She's wearing villager clothes. <br/>
Bitch's sword is probably of a high quality. If something happens then we are finished. <br/>
There is no time to choose the means. <br/>
Shield of Anger! <br/>
With the thought of losing Raphtalia I activate the Curse Series Shield. <br/>
 <br/>
"Ah, Wait!" <br/>
"Uoooooooooooooo!" <br/>
 <br/>
Make it in time......Make it in time......Make it in timeeeeeeeeeeee! <br/>
The world instantly slows down. While my mind was being eroded I cast my skills. <br/>
 <br/>
"Air Strike Shield! Second Shield!" <br/>
 <br/>
Two shields appear between Raphtalia and the sword <br/>
With a clang, bitch's sword was repelled. <br/>
 <br/>
"Haa......Haa......" <br/>
 <br/>
I made it in time, somehow. <br/>
 <br/>
"Eat this!" <br/>
 <br/>
Motoyasu aims his skill at me who sighed in relief. <br/>
If I'm not mistaken, those are the movements for the Meteor Spear. <br/>
It seems while using the Curse Series, not only is my body enhanced, but also my kinetic vision. <br/>
I powerfully grasp the the shining spear head. <br/>
 <br/>
"Im-Impossible! Grabbing the Meteor Spear!?" <br/>
 <br/>
"You retard, you just used that skill a while ago! What kind of idiot would forget!? Fool!" <br/>
 <br/>
The counter effect of the shield of anger is based on the attack's strength. Self Curse Burning is activated. <br/>
The strength of this flame is influenced by my anger. <br/>
I was almost consumed by rage when I saw Raphtalia about to be stabbed. This generated an enormous amount of power. <br/>
 <br/>
"Uwaaaaah!" <br/>
 <br/>
Motoyasu's whole body was covered in black flames, and he was rolling around in pain. <br/>
Guu......If I don't change shield I'll forget myself in anger. <br/>
 <br/>
"Not yet!" <br/>
 <br/>
The bitch hasn't learnt her lesson yet and tried to stab Raphtalia again. <br/>
Shit...... Cooldown time! <br/>
They are just about to end! <br/>
 <br/>
"Shield---" <br/>
 <br/>
Not in time! <br/>
Raphtalia was...... <br/>
The bitch's assassin's knife hits Raphtalia. <br/>
 <br/>
"Ahahahahaha, trying to deft me......What!?" <br/>
 <br/>
Raphtalia disappears and all that's left is an after-image. <br/>
 <br/>
"Your magical power was not enough to completely nullify my illusion magic. Now it's my turn!"
