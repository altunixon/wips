Jealousy <br/>
 <br/>
Motoyasu put the end of the flag into his mouth and stretched it with all his strength as he glared at me with a look of jealousy. <br/>
 <br/>
"Wasn't it your own fault! What are you looking at me enviously for!" (Naofumi) <br/>
"No way, father-in-law! Doing that as parent and child is a crime! It's not like I'm feeling jealous or anything!" (Motoyasu) <br/>
"Don't make it so obvious idioooot!" (Naofumi) <br/>
 <br/>
Step by step, Firo is approaching me. Should I run away? I have a feeling Firo is only approaching slowly because I'm within range. Well, I'll confirm with the monster crest item first. It's unrefutably a sandstorm. Operation impossible. Next is, exclude Firo from the party! <br/>
 <br/>
"Meteor Shield!" (Naofumi) <br/>
"Hindrance-" (Firo) <br/>
 <br/>
The developed Meteor Shield was destroyed in one hit! H, hey! This is seriously bad. I'll get done by Firo at this rate! <br/>
 <br/>
"So jealous, so jealous-! I'm so jealous of you being loved by Firo-tan" (Motoyasu) <br/>
"Shut up-!" (Naofumi) <br/>
 <br/>
Who's fault do you think it is! Motoyasu's spear...it seems that spear is granting power to Firo. It probably has an effect of lending power to those overcome by lust. What a bothersome ability to possess. <br/>
 <br/>
"Motoyasu, hurry and change that spear!" (Naofumi) <br/>
"What are you saying, father-in-law. There's no way I could change a spear that appeared from my love for Firo-tan" (Motoyasu) <br/>
"Your beloved Firo will run wild at this rate!" (Naofumi) <br/>
 <br/>
I am the main victim. Isn't it normally the opposite? <br/>
 <br/>
Defeating Motoyasu for Firo who was brainwashed by Motoyasu...won't happen. It's become to defeat Firo to stop her rampaging caused by Motoyasu. <br/>
 <br/>
If I am defeated in the former scenario, Firo will be done by Motoyasu. If I am defeated in the latter scenario, I will be done by Firo. Why is it. <br/>
 <br/>
"No gooooood! Firo-taaaaaaaan!" (Motoyasu) <br/>
 <br/>
Motoyasu rushed over and stood in front of me as if to shield me. Then he faced Firo and shouted. <br/>
 <br/>
"That's no good Firo-tan. Incest is no good!" (Motoyasu) <br/>
"We aren't even real parent and child!" (Naofumi) <br/>
 <br/>
I've had enough of this state of affairs. From the start. <br/>
 <br/>
"Firo-tan! That's no good" (Motoyasu) <br/>
"Move-" (Firo) <br/>
"Nuah! Even then, I'll show you that I can prevent you from going down the path of evil!" (Motoyasu) <br/>
 <br/>
Why Motoyasu is trying to stop Firo's advance with his back turned towards me, I want to consult this with Raphtalia. Why is Raphtalia not here. Raphtalia would be able to understand. This resentment with no comparion. <br/>
 <br/>
"Like I said, hurry and change your spear!" (Naofumi) <br/>
"Master...haa...Firo's-...haa...n..." (Firo) <br/>
"Youuu! Father-in-law. I'm sooooooo envious. Being so valued by Firo-chan, soooo bitterrrrr! Is, how I feel" (Motoyasu) <br/>
"Shut up!" (Naofumi) <br/>
 <br/>
Who's fault do think it is! It's you! You! <br/>
 <br/>
"So jealous, so jealous!" (Motoyasu) <br/>
 <br/>
Don't stamp your feet it's disgusting! Don't put on that disgusting smile while getting grappled by Firo. As to why I know what his face looks like, it's because he turned this way and spoke. The idiot. <br/>
 <br/>
"So bitterrrrr..." (Motoyasu)  <br/>
 <br/>
What!? <br/>
A black aura is gushing out of Motoyasu's spear. The flag tied to Motoyasu's spear tore...the spear's tip is revealed. <br/>
...Why does it look like the tip of Motoyasu's spear is covered by a mosaic? <br/>
 <br/>
"Wha...wha..." (Melty) <br/>
 <br/>
Turning to look towards the voice, I see Melty's flushed face. Identically, Rishia who stood recovered from motion sickness was using both hands to cover her eyes with a red face. <br/>
 <br/>
"Why do you have a spear with such a shape!" (Melty) <br/>
 <br/>
Her loud voice echoed. <br/>
 <br/>
"Umm...you can see it Melty?" (Naofumi) <br/>
"Naofumi can't see it!?" (Melty) <br/>
"Just on the spear's tip, there's a mosaic...it appears blurred" (Naofumi) <br/>
"Fuee...I saw iiit..." (Rishia) <br/>
 <br/>
What? I can't see because of the mosaic, but it seems Melty and the others can see it clearly. <br/>
 <br/>
"Why can't you see it" (Melty) <br/>
"What kind of shape is it?" (Naofumi) <br/>
 <br/>
On the other hand, I'm welling with interest since I can't see it. Rather why is it only me who can't see it? <br/>
 <br/>
"That's sexual harrassment! If you weren't Naofumi, severe punishment would've been dealt! Rather, aren't you just saying you can't see to humiliate me!" (Melty) <br/>
"Sexual harrassment...huh" (Naofumi) <br/>
 <br/>
Just...what kind of shape does it have? Things to consider...stuff covered by mosaics on television. Guro..probably not. There would have been mosaics when monsters were being dismantled. <br/>
 <br/>
In which case, I'm guessing it probably has the shape of that thing in the wagon of Elizabeth's portable shrine. //phallic festival <br/>
What kind of game did the men's thrusting spear appear in again. A spear that does double damage to females. <br/>
 <br/>
I'll confirm the shape of Motoyasu's spear once again. An ominous scorpion and snake ornament adorn the handle. The spearhead is still covered by a mosaic. <br/>
 <br/>
"Fa, ther..." (Motoyasu) <br/>
 <br/>
This guy is still calling me father-in-law at this point. Even while being corroded by the Curse Series. How admirable. It already feels like it'd be fine to call it my loss. <br/>
 <br/>
"I will steal, your daughter. With this Lust Envy Spear IV" (Motoyasu) <br/>
 <br/>
...Haa. I'm about to be corroded by melancholy. <br/>
 <br/>
"Firo-tan! I, will stop you, and take your purity!" (Motoyasu) <br/>
 <br/>
Motoyasu pointed his spear towards Firo. <br/>
...Just where are you pointing at. Don't set your aim at the lower half of her body. <br/>
 <br/>
"Uu...I'm not going easy if you get in my way" (Firo) <br/>
 <br/>
Firo also seriously gathered power and took a stance. Thus Firo and Motoyasu began slowly approaching each other as they looked for openings. <br/>
 <br/>
"...Um, what would be good for us to do?" <br/>
 <br/>
Atla and Melty ask with half-amazed expressions while standing as if to protect me. I don't know either. <br/>
 <br/>
Why is Motoyasu protecting us? Motoyasu is acting like an enigmatic ally. It's so baffling my head is starting to hurt. <br/>
 <br/>
"I don't know" (Naofumi) <br/>
 <br/>
I just want to quickly return. But, I won't be able to return at this rate. Motoyasu started circling towards Firo's rear with his spear still pointed downwards. Where are you intending to set your aim! <br/>
 <br/>
"Fire! Ressentiment!" (Motoyasu) <br/>
 <br/>
Again, something is passing through nearby. Temptation also affected me. But, the skill this time.... <br/>
 <br/>
Fumu, for some reason I recall the incident when I was had by Motoyasu and Witch. But these feelings of resentment are a daily thing, nothing was affected by seeing the betrayed and ruined Motoyasu. Or rather, Raphtalia's face came to mind right afterwards but nothing happened. What kind of skill was that? <br/>
 <br/>
"Uu...my head is getting strange" (Melty) <br/>
"Fueee...Itsuki-sama-" (Rishia) <br/>
"Onii-sama...I'm envious..." (Atla) <br/>
 <br/>
Melty, Rishia, and Atla are moaning painfully. Is the skill a mind attack type? Temptation was also a mind attack type, you could say Motoyasu is a pro in that field. To be using it himself, even though he's badmouthed and attacked me over a brainwashing shield.... <br/>
 <br/>
"Get yourselves together!" (Naofumi) <br/>
"""Hah!?""" <br/>
"What did you feel?" (Naofumi) <br/>
"..." (Melty) <br/>
 <br/>
Melty quickly averted her line of sight. Next, Rishia muddled her words with the usual "fuee". <br/>
 <br/>
"The image of onii-sama and Naofumi-sama having a harmonious relationship appeared in my mind" (Atla) <br/>
"Why should I get along with Fohl" (Naofumi) <br/>
 <br/>
It seems to set a field with the effect of amplifying feelings of jealousy...that kind of feeling? Well, it wouldn't be strange even if everyone held one or two feelings of jealousy. As I thought, it was a mind attack type. Why did this guy use this kind of skill! <br/>
 <br/>
"The power in my heart, is increasing" (Motoyasu) <br/>
 <br/>
Ah, boosting yourself with the power of jealousy. <br/>
 <br/>
"Reach it! My! Heart of love!" (Motoyasu) <br/>
 <br/>
Motoyasu hoisted his spear up high. <br/>
...What part of Firo are you planning to thrust that spear. <br/>
 <br/>
"Don't, get in Firo's way-!" (Firo) <br/>
 <br/>
Firo was able to turn and dodge faster than Motoyasu could thrust. Maybe thanks to the curse, Motoyasu's movements are considerably fast. No, I have a feeling it's not just that. He's even faster than Ren. Not that he wouldn't be able to keep up at all, but I doubt he'd be able to catch up. <br/>
 <br/>
"Firo-tan! Meteor Spear!" (Motoyasu) <br/>
 <br/>
Bashii! Motoyasu fired his skill aimed at Firo. <br/>
 <br/>
"Nnnngghhhhh!" (Firo) <br/>
 <br/>
Firo dodged Motoyasu's Meteor Spear by a paper-thin margin and kicked Motoyasu's chest. <br/>
 <br/>
"Gu...Firo-tan's kick, I'm so happy..." (Motoyasu)
