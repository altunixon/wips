Your daily dose of Tate no Yuusha! (Courtesy of Kookie because Yoraikun doesn’t release TnY on Sundays EST-time)<br/>
This isn’t me committing to a weekly update though, commitment is too hard >w<<br/>
Kookie has decided to go through an editor recruitment. To apply please comment… 5 major improvements for a single chapter (for this and future chapters, I cbf with past chapters)<br/>
…less than 5 means an editor is not needed, right? (At what stage is an editor needed anyway?)<br/>
Growing Worse<br/>
And so, the events of the morning after dealing with the bandits.<br/>
"Naofumi-sama! I’m home~!" (Raphtalia)<br/>
Raphtalia opened the door and entered the house.<br/>
We met just a few days ago, but feeling like we haven’t seen each other in a while is because we’re now in the village, or because we’re in the house I live in with Raphtalia, huh.<br/>
I can’t tell.<br/>
"Hm…ah, Raphtalia, welcome home." (Naofumi)<br/>
"Onee-chan, welcome home~" (Firo)<br/>
"Ah, welcome home Raphtalia-chan~" (Kiel)<br/>
"Welcome home, Raphtalia-san." (Imia)<br/>
"Kyua!" (Gaelion)<br/>
Raphtalia looked around in wonder at my surroundings.<br/>
It’s not a reaction I see often.<br/>
"It’s gotten worse than before!" (Raphtalia)<br/>
Raphtalia exclaimed in astonishment right after returning.<br/>
By the way, on the bed was Firo and Gaelion, as well as the loinclothed dog and Imia.<br/>
"What’s the meaning of this, Naofumi-sama!" (Raphtalia)<br/>
"Ah, I invited Firo to my bed as a countermeasure against Atla in the beginning, but Firo caused a problem after a short time so I had Kiel and Imia stand guard instead." (Naofumi)<br/>
"Sadina onee-san!" (Raphtalia)<br/>
Raphtalia questioned Sadina, who was lying on the other bed with Atla.<br/>
"As I promised, I haven’t let Atla-chan into Naofumi-chan’s bed." (Sadina)<br/>
"That’s not what I’m asking about!" (Raphtalia)<br/>
Raphtalia staggered and then leaned against the wall.<br/>
Is she alright?<br/>
"Are you tired from training? You’d better rest well. I can cast recovery magic if you like. Recently I’ve worked out a way to increase its effects." (Naofumi)<br/>
"It’s not that!" (Raphtalia)<br/>
Raphtalia was in denial.<br/>
I was thinking of showing her the newly thought up Liberation-type magic though.<br/>
"Naofumi, what’s up? What happened?" (Ren)<br/>
Hearing the commotion, Ren and Rishia and Itsuki exited their temporary house.<br/>
Their response is good.<br/>
It seems they’ll be able to cope when an incident occurs.<br/>
"….Why are the Sword and Bow Heroes here!" (Raphtalia)<br/>
"Huh? I haven’t told you?" (Naofumi)<br/>
She came out from the Castle as if it was natural so I thought she knew, but she didn’t know?<br/>
To begin with, she should have heard that I was cooperating with Motoyasu to protect the Castle Town but… ah, that was after Raphtalia broke out, huh.<br/>
Speaking of which, Motoyasu views Raphtalia as a pig so they can’t hold any conversations.<br/>
Because Raphtalia is female.<br/>
"I had some growth as a human being, and came to work in Naofumi’s place after I thought about fighting for the sake of world but…" (Ren)<br/>
Even I would like you to hurry up and be independent.<br/>
Saying ‘hey, hey’, he came to reside in my village for some reason.<br/>
Well, it might be fine like this in terms of management.<br/>
"Atla!" (Fohl)<br/>
Fohl came into the room and embraced Atla.<br/>
"Nii-chan finally came home!" (Fohl)<br/>
"Please stop, Onii-sama, Naofumi-sama is watching." (Atla)<br/>
"Hmph! Now that I’ve returned, don’t go thinking you can continue as you have been doing!" (Fohl)<br/>
"Ah, yes yes." (Naofumi)<br/>
It looks like Fohl’s really glad to officially be back, that Sis-Con.<br/>
He’s actually crying. So he liked Atla that much.<br/>
Huh, Fohl is alright.<br/>
"Naofumi-sama, please explain!" (Raphtalia)<br/>
"A lot of things happened." (Naofumi)<br/>
"A one-liner! Aren’t those just some convenient words. If you don’t explain properly, I won’t be accountable for what happens." (Raphtalia)<br/>
"Ask the person himself." (Naofumi)<br/>
At my reply, Ren started talking about being deceived by Witch and then being defeated by us, which led to him coming here for rehabilitation.<br/>
How Rishia defeated Itsuki in the same way and Itsuki being in recuperation was also explained.<br/>
Because the current Itsuki has become a ‘Yes Man’ and will obey everything that is said.<br/>
"Sigh… I understand the circumstances. Come to think of it, such a terrible thing happened in the village so it’s a likely situation." (Raphtalia)<br/>
"Is there really such a change?" (Naofumi)<br/>
"There is! Hasn’t the village’s surroundings become a dense forest! Moreover, there’s also a farm nearby with Filorials that look like Firo!" (Raphtalia)<br/>
"It is like that, now that you mention it." (Naofumi)<br/>
"It really does look like a lot of things happened while I was away." (Raphtalia)<br/>
"I suppose." (Naofumi)<br/>
Come to think of it, even though it’s only been a month and a half since Raphtalia left for training, I feel like there’s been a lot of fighting.<br/>
Bringing down each of the three heroes is still fresh in my mind.<br/>
Some of it can be called beating, but there are also some shady things mixed in.<br/>
It can be taken as lengthy too…. or is it short, it’s been a series of battles day after day.<br/>
"Now then, Raphtalia-chan’s return means Onee-chan has completed her duty." (Sadina)<br/>
"That’s right." (Naofumi)<br/>
"It’s disappointing that you didn’t understand what I meant, Sadina Onee-san." (Raphtalia)<br/>
As far as it goes, was she helpful?<br/>
Well, Atla didn’t enter my bed.<br/>
"And so, Raphtalia-chan, I’ll be taking Naofumi-chan~" (Sadina)<br/>
"What are you saying!" (Raphtalia)<br/>
"What are you saying!" (Naofumi)<br/>
"Er…. I am.. seriously aiming for Naofumi-chan?" (Sadina)<br/>
Sadina calmly answered while swaying.<br/>
Stop it, that’s disgusting<br/>
"Perhaps  Naofumi-chan prefers this human form? Then shall Onee-chan gallantly take care of you in my human form?" (Sadina)<br/>
"Sadina Onee-san….. are these your true feelings?" (Raphtalia)<br/>
"That’s right~" (Sadina)<br/>
"Then now that Raphtalia san has returned, you can finally start the fight." (Atla)<br/>
Atla asked for confirmation as if it was a matter of course.<br/>
This wasn’t a preparatory period!<br/>
I can tell you like me from your attitude but all your heads are just filled with flowers.<br/>
Especially Raphtalia.<br/>
"That’s right. I did as promised with Atla, and I waited until Raphtalia-chan returned. Now then, won’t you assault Naofumi-chan together with Onee-chan." (Sadina) [T/N: …3P rape?]<br/>
Raphtalia’s expression turned pale before my eyes and she turned to face me.<br/>
"Naofumi-sama…. could you possibly have ….. had a drinking competition with Sadina Onee-san?" (Raphtalia)<br/>
"Yeah, we did." (Naofumi)<br/>
Raphtalia bent back and facepalmed as if she received a shock.<br/>
What’s with that?<br/>
"Naofumi-sama… Sadina has been telling the villagers about a certain rule for a long time now." (Raphtalia)<br/>
"Sigh…" (Naofumi)<br/>
Kiel also nodded in agreement.<br/>
What the hell.<br/>
"Sadina Onee-san said ‘My life companion must be someone who can drink more than me! If I meet someone like that, I’ll never let them go so everyone should be prepared~'" (Raphtalia)<br/>
"Hmm…" (Naofumi)<br/>
"If Sadina nee-chan is designating Nii-chan as her future husband to that extent, then Nii-chan must have had a drinking competition and won or so everyone in the village has been thinking." (Kiel)<br/>
"Come again?" (Naofumi)<br/>
Well it’s true I had a complete victory in the drinking competition against Sadina.<br/>
Eh? So that’s the reason Sadina wanted me as a husband?<br/>
I thought it was just a prank.<br/>
When I looked towards Sadina, she was in her human form, holding her cheeks with her hands and looking bashful.<br/>
"I really enjoyed the days of watching Naofumi-chan’s sleeping face every night." (Sadina)<br/>
Ugh…. not just Atla, the perverts are increasing!<br/>
I’m not interested in that.<br/>
"Nii-chan, how did you win against Sadina nee-chan?" (Kiel)<br/>
"I just ate a Lukor fruit?" (Naofumi)<br/>
"""Of course….""" (Kiel & Slaves)<br/>
Kiel and the other village-born slaves nodded unanimously.<br/>
It seems Imia also nodded.<br/>
Was it well-known because Sadina played the role of Big Sister in the village?<br/>
"It was shown sometime when we went peddling, I think." (Naofumi)<br/>
"Eh? That was the Lukor Fruit? I thought it was a sign of welcome." (Kiel)<br/>
It’s about the guy who made me eat Lukor Fruit as a countermeasure against impostors calling themselves the Hero of the Shield to become famous.<br/>
As expected, it seems there are no other guys who can safely eat Lukor Fruit apart from me.<br/>
It was thought to be some kind of reception and a tool to judge imposters.<br/>
"…I see, Naofumi-san is an ability wielder of Intoxication Neutralization. Everything points to that." (Itsuki)<br/>
Itsuki just said something incomprehensible.<br/>
Ren and I slowly turned to face Itsuki,<br/>
"Ability wielder?" (Naofumi)<br/>
"Was there such a system?" (Ren)<br/>
I have abilities that resemble a resistance against abnormal status conditions.<br/>
Can I say it’s like that?<br/>
Unfortunately, I don’t recall an ability to neutralise intoxication.<br/>
"No, that’s not it. Us dimension travellers only attained these abilities before we came to this world." (Itsuki)<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
