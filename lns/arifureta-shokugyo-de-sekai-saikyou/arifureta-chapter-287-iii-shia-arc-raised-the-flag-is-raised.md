Arifureta After III   Shia Arc   Raised! The Flag is Raised!<br/>
<br/>
Hajime and Shia, who left the village even while the villagers were reluctant to see them go, were aiming straight for the city of Puhang upstream.<br/>
They were stuffing their cheeks with bread that looked like nan, with a lot of meat in between, that was kindly given to them by the villagers when they left. They were eating while advancing along the river that still had the coldness of the morning remaining.<br/>
「Delish- desuu. I missed the chance to ask, but what kind of meat is this?」<br/>
「I wonder. This feeling of overflowing wild taste, it somehow reminds me of when I was in the Abyss……」<br/>
Hajime and Shia were going ‘delicious delicious’ in a display of gluttony regardless of the fact that it hadn’t even been a few hours since they received breakfast.<br/>
「In any case, they were a pleasant bunch, weren’t they. That……Wandam? Though I cannot say the same about the way he was looking at me.」<br/>
「It’s Bantas-san. Certainly, it was a beautiful spinning kick. Though it’s still not at the level of a certain muscular actor.」<br/>
Shia laughed loudly. Bantas, who fought a young girl to a draw, got high spirited when Hajime and Shia exhibited a mock fight with sublimely advanced fighting styles. He begged to also have a match with Hajime by any means.<br/>
The way Hajime fought compared to Shia left an impression of boorishness that couldn’t be erased. It didn’t have the flowing elegance of "martial arts" that was backed with history like Shia’s, who was adopting various hand-to-hand fighting techniques.<br/>
Although, Hajime’s taijutsu that was sublimated by accumulating real battle after real battle where his life was on the line should be said as the height of rationality.<br/>
His figure perfectly handling the entirety of Shia’s flowing offense that was like a surging wave using the minimum movement necessary made anyone who watched it feel beauty from it in its own way.<br/>
Not just Bantas, it also went without saying that the men of the village had their blood boiling.<br/>
「Hajime-san, sometimes you are strangely popular among the males, just like with Tou-sama(father) and others. Especially among the beefy people……」<br/>
「Stop it, don’t say any more.」<br/>
Recalling how the village males were approaching him with their muscles twitching, Hajime shuddered while shaking his head. Shia raised a chuckle seeing Hajime react so.<br/>
「They said that they wanted us to come again next year. They expressly gave us the invitation, so let’s come again while bringing a souvenir next time, okay Hajime-san?」<br/>
「……I guess.」<br/>
Shia expressed her happiness at the unexpected chance meeting on the trip with a wide smile. Her rabbit ears were also whooshing around.<br/>
However, Hajime showed a bit of a thinking gesture while agreeing. Shia thought 「Eh? He isn’t enthusiastic?」 while she peeked at Hajime’s expression with a bit of unease.<br/>
Hajime smiled wryly thinking that he was worrying Shia and spoke while patting her head *pon pon*.<br/>
「Don’t make that kind of face. I’m just thinking a bit.」<br/>
「Thinking……is it?」<br/>
「Yeah. I’m thinking that if you are enjoying it that much, then perhaps it’s fine to make the travel date with just Shia a custom for once a year at least.」<br/>
「Hajime-san!」<br/>
Her rabbit ears stood straight *Pi─n-!* The lovely suggestion caused Shia’s eyes to sparkle with stars of delight, and then she leapt at Hajime while glittering with joy.<br/>
And then without pause, she puckered her lips 「Nn~~」 and approached for a kiss.<br/>
「I get it that you’re happy, so, for now, how about you clean up the food scraps around your mouth first?」<br/>
Shia’s face became bright red, and her body backed away gracefully.<br/>
It was a rare occurrence, but sometimes, like just now, Shia became a disappointing rabbit. Hajime fondly watched such Shia with affection, and then he personally cleaned Shia’s mouth. Shia look embarrassed, but she kept her eyes closed.<br/>
Toward such Shia, Hajime brought his face closer to continue where they left off even though it was early in the morning. Shia, who felt his presence, also leaned her body forward in response……<br/>
「A?」<br/>
「Hmm?」<br/>
Both of them simultaneously turned their gaze deep inside the forest. *rustle rustle* The sound of feet treading firmly on vegetation resounded faintly.<br/>
「It’s not some animal, isn’t it?」<br/>
「There was the talk about the youngsters of other villages loitering around, but……」<br/>
Now then, what could be the reason for them being here? The answer immediately became clear.<br/>
「So it’s really true. There are a foreigner man and woman here.」<br/>
「Oo, they got various pricey looking things on them.」<br/>
「The girl is drop dead gorgeous.」<br/>
「Whatever, as expected foreign tourists are idiots, huh. Taking in sights defenselessly in this kind of place.」<br/>
Just from that conversation, it was clear that these were the insolent people the villagers warned them about.<br/>
While the fighting festival was happening that merrily, surely the rumor about a foreign couple with affluent looks, just from their nice belongings, would quickly spread to the other villages too.<br/>
Tourists visiting dangerous places with a sightseeing mood without really gathering information about the locals and even without the self-awareness of how ignorant, rash, and reckless they were acting while holding a groundlessly optimistic view that it was impossible for misfortune to befall them……<br/>
This rude bunch was surely aiming for that kind of tourists, who were just begging to be robbed.<br/>
With a grin on their faces, the robber look-alikes were gathering while showing something that looked like rifles, even though they looked old.<br/>
「This kind of people exist no matter what world it is, isn’t it? Well, it doesn’t matter. Right here, with the fist of Uga that I had just learned, I will teach them the harshness of socie──」<br/>
The moment Shia clenched her fist to give them a lesson,<br/>
──*DOPAN-DOPAN-DOPAN-DOPAN-*<br/>
Consecutive gunshot sounds echoed inside the forest. At the same time, the young men showing up from inside the forest were disappearing into the forest as though in a video playback. More accurately, they were sent flying, or perhaps it should be called as knocked flying.<br/>
「Wha-, wha-, this guy──」<br/>
「He is carrying a gun! Run──」<br/>
「Sto, stop! We aren’t planning anything! Look, I’m putting down the gun! So don’t sho──」<br/>
Everyone peacefully returned back deep into the forest. There was no exception.<br/>
「Be thankful, tearfully, that you guys at least didn’t get returned to the earth.」<br/>
Mercilessly, no, just using a stun bullet was already merciful, Hajime-san shot everyone without caring whether they were escaping or raising their hands in surrender.<br/>
It didn’t even take five seconds for the figure of about ten people from the bunch to vanish from view.<br/>
「Ha, Hajime-san?」<br/>
On Earth, Hajime fundamentally didn’t pull out Donner. If it was only someone picking a quarrel, then he would deal with them using his bare hands (he used his left hand without reservation); but here he chose the gun without a moment of hesitation. Shia’s eyes turned round seeing Hajime’s reaction that was different from usual.<br/>
Hajime shrugged his shoulders and stored Donner back into the holster on his chest.<br/>
「There is no one watching after all.」<br/>
In other words, it seemed if it was a place where there were no witnesses, he wouldn’t hesitate to use Donner in order to settle the problem in a flash. For the insolent people who encountered Hajime in a place outside of the public gaze, it was a dangerous place indeed.<br/>
Hajime, who normally said something like 「I’ll comply with the law and ethics that is appropriate for a citizen of a constitutional country. After all, there is a difference from Tortus here you know.」, was shooting unhesitatingly……<br/>
「Hajime-san. The way of thinking that it’s okay to shoot if there are no witnesses feels like it’s normally outlawish though.」<br/>
「Oi oi, how can you say that to a virtuous and exemplary Japanese person like me.」<br/>
A virtuous and exemplary Japanese person was surely a person who would modestly respect propriety, avoid acts of violence, and honor the law to the best of their ability, was how she felt……Shia’s expression turned really complicated.<br/>
「Before this, Myuu-chan said "innocent until proven guilty. Everything is legal if it’s not leaked out." She said outrageous things by quoting someone’s words, but……now I feel like I understand whose words they were.」<br/>
「There is nothing in my log about that.」<br/>
Hajime papa averted his gaze to escape Shia’s fixed stare.<br/>
※Those were words that a good kid must not believe no matter what!<br/>
Shia made a wry smile toward the bad papa who was turning the other way. However, her expression turned into a bright smile right after that.<br/>
「Well, they are scoundrels, so it doesn’t matter whatever happened to them!」<br/>
「That’s a lovely conclusion Shia. I’m falling in love with you all over again.」<br/>
*ruffle-ruffle! pat pat!* The scene of an idiotic couple flirting beside the forest where multiple locals had collapsed was truly surreal.<br/>
By the way, in case it was Shia who dealt with them, they would definitely have ended up in a state where they were an inch before being beaten to death, so in a sense, Hajime’s non-lethal gunshots were more fortunate to them. The gunshots that came from the irritation from the kiss getting obstructed……in a sense, they attacked at a nice timing.<br/>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <br/>
Time advanced boisterously and flirtatiously for a while.<br/>
The sun had risen high in the sky, about the time when it could almost be considered afternoon. The river’s width suddenly expanded, and a town could be seen up ahead. It was the town of Puhang.<br/>
The automobiles and maintained road that were common conveniences of modern civilization could be seen.<br/>
Originally, it was a place that could be reached in four hours if one used a car or bus from a town that had a train station or airport. There were no whimsical travelers like Hajime and Shia who would intentionally walk inside a thick forest along the river for a few days laboriously to reach this city.<br/>
「How should I say it, it’s that. It feels like when you encounter someone who used a cable car to reach the summit after you were climbing up with trouble.」<br/>
「The mountain climber is enjoying the climb, so it’s fine desuu.」<br/>
Hajime smiled wryly after seeing an old truck pass by noisily, which caused Shia to pout.<br/>
「Don’t sulk. I also had fun. Rather than that, it’s afternoon already. I’m hungry after a good workout, what about you Shia?」<br/>
「You’re right~. I’m also getting hungry. According to the villagers, there are a lot of delicious restaurants, so let’s eat lightly.」<br/>
「Yeah. If I remember right, the recommendation is for a restaurant with a terrace along the river was it?」<br/>
「Desu desu. They told me that the steamed river fish is tasty.」<br/>
They continued talking while entering the city. There they saw that unexpectedly there were a lot of foreigners. It shouldn’t be a particularly famous tourist spot, but far up ahead of here there was another tourist spot, so perhaps this place was bustling as a resting point.<br/>
Shia asked a local for directions with her innate amiability. In this place too, the sight of the locals getting bug-eyed hearing Shia talking in local language fluently could be seen as expected. The person she talked to also started smiling naturally. And then, they taught her the directions kindly and thoroughly.<br/>
「Over there he said! Hajime-san, it’s that white building!」<br/>
「I got it, that’s why you don’t have to hop around. You are being stared at with lukewarm gazes by everyone around, you know? Even me too.」<br/>
The local people, whether they were young or old, male or female, were watching Shia who was running across the street toward her lover with gentle eyes. Incidentally, pleasant gazes were also directed toward Hajime, who was looking somewhat embarrassed.<br/>
It was then that a car was seen gunning past with quite the speed. Even though it was in the middle of the city, with that speed, the car undoubtedly would be unable to stop even if something suddenly leapt out in front of it.<br/>
Shia, who was in the middle of crossing the street, leapt toward Hajime in a bit of a panic.<br/>
「That’s really dangerous isn’t it~. Why is that car in such a hurry, I wonder?」<br/>
「Who knows. Rather than that, they are driving a good car there. What’s more, the cars’ types are all the same. Are they in a group?」<br/>
Just as Hajime said, the car dangerously driving wasn’t just that one alone.<br/>
Six SUVs that at a glance looked high class with high performance were gunning through in a line. It felt like the cars were prepared altogether, so at the very least there was no doubt that they were from an organization with quite the financial muscle.<br/>
Hajime’s interest was a bit tickled at the sudden appearance of these people who came to this kind of place in a group of high-class SUVs, but it also wasn’t something to the degree that would make him intentionally investigate. He immediately chased them out of his mind and started walking while holding Shia’s hand so she wouldn’t hop around.<br/>
They walked through a place that looked like a promenade along the riverbank heading toward the restaurant.<br/>
The river’s appearance wasn’t beautiful, so no foreign tourist was watching the view, but several local people were fishing on a protruding wharf. They were chatting while placing their feet into the river. Some other people were washing clothes or other things. It could be seen from this how the river was closely connected to daily life.<br/>
Furthermore,<br/>
「There are a lot of boats. There is also a floating market~」<br/>
「This is the place where the river branches merge after all, so a ship must be a valid method to transport material here.」<br/>
As though to show it, ships with a lot of utility were mooring at jutted out wharves, which were also numerous. While there were wooden rowing boats, there were also boats with engines. However, they were all uniformly only old things that had been used for a long time.<br/>
Suddenly Hajime asked something that came to mind.<br/>
「Come to think of it, Shia. About the ruins we were told about at the village, based on what I saw on the map they’re really far from here. Are we still going to walk? It will take around a week if we detour up until the place with the bridge, you know?」<br/>
「Aa~ uu~. Actually, it will be nicer to walk, but……as expected, that will take too much time. I have enjoyed traveling by foot a lot, and here boats also seem to be mainstream……」<br/>
Shia kept glancing at Hajime looking a bit embarrassed perhaps because it sounded like she was taking back her own words.<br/>
Hajime smiled wryly while secretly making his Treasure Warehouse II shine. He summoned the hard working Arachne-san who were in the process of being turned into Jack of All Trades. He took them out from inside his clothes so that they wouldn’t come out from thin air, and all the Arachnes went down to the ground through Hajime’s foot with a rustling sound.<br/>
「……Hajime-san. I’ve been thinking since some time ago, but why spiders? Honestly speaking, they are a bit chilling.」<br/>
Countless spiders were crawling out from his body……. Certainly, normally it would be a sight that would make anyone faint.<br/>
Hajime, who was asked such a question, positioned Arachne in four directions and activated an awareness obstruction barrier while answering with a puzzled look.<br/>
「Eh? It’s cool, right?」<br/>
「……」<br/>
Shia softly averted her eyes. It seemed that Hajime’s fundamental chuunibyou was impossible to be healed.<br/>
A flustered look emerged on Hajime’s face. Despite him thinking that if it was Shia, she would approve saying 「You’re right!」, but she was just getting creeped out. Her rabbit ears were tapping *pon pon* on Hajime’s head softly, as though saying 「It’s all right, it’s all right I’m telling you. Okay?」, making him feel like asking just what was all right.<br/>
「No no, Shia. Try imagining it for a bit. A multi-legged tank is cool, right? It’s romantic, right? On the Armor○ Core we played before this, even you were using the multi-legged tank, weren’t you? Besides, it’s that. See, even that person in a certain ○moon game, he said "a spider who laid string on the surface as a nest" about himself, also there is that! Even a certain hero of America is totally a spider you know! After that──」 (TN: About the moon something, it’s a reference to Nanaya Shiki from Melty Blood, Hajime is quoting that guy’s victory line there.)<br/>
「I understand. I understand already. It’s fine you know, Hajime-san.」<br/>
「Oi stop it. Don’t look at me with gentle eyes like that! Eeei-, don’t pat me! Don’t hug me!」<br/>
Shia’s gaze was full of compassion. 9999 damage to Hajime’s heart.<br/>
Hajime forcefully tore Shia away from himself and whimpered while taking out a boat and mooring it at the nearby spot. It was a black coated boat with the proper construction.<br/>
──Prototype amphibious boat   Triana<br/>
It was the prototype boat of the artifact that he had sent to a certain friend. Other than being able to move at high speed on the water, it could also run on land by pulling out its stored wheels.<br/>
「Let’s use this until we get near the ruins.」<br/>
「Does it need to be taken out right now?」<br/>
Shia tilted her head in puzzlement. Even though they were going to have lunch after this, why did Hajime took the boat out right now?<br/>
「No, actually, this is still in the prototype stage……or rather, it’s incomplete. I’m thinking that while we are eating, I’ll use the Arachne for remote transmutation and complete it to some degree.」<br/>
「Arachne-san is working hard, isn’t it? But, it’s floating normally right now, it can run on water already, doesn’t it? I think it’s enough like that though……」<br/>
Shia was puzzled. She wondered that despite Hajime calling it a motorboat; perhaps, unexpectedly, it was still at a stage where it wasn’t even equipped with a propulsive mechanism. But Hajime began by saying 「Of course it will run normally if I make it run, but……」<br/>
「It’s not installed with any weapons at all.」<br/>
「Yes?」<br/>
‘I don’t really get what you are saying desu,’ Shia made an astonished expression that said that.<br/>
「Err, Hajime-san. I think it doesn’t really need any weapons or anything though……」<br/>
Shia said such a thing in bewilderment. Hajime turned a shocked expression toward Shia. His face truly looked as though it was expressing ‘I don’t really get what you are saying desu.’<br/>
「Are you in your right mind Shia? Something like a vehicle without a weapon is the same as a car without any brakes! That’s too dangerous!」<br/>
「Rather I think that it’s Hajime-san’s heart that is in need of some brakes.」<br/>
If it had to be said further, rather than a car without a weapon, it was the cars with weapons that were dangerous no matter how one thought about it.<br/>
But Hajime shook his head as though to say ‘Just what are you saying,’ and then opened his mouth as though he was persuading an unreasonable kid.<br/>
「Listen well Shia and think really carefully. What will happen to Bon○-san if there are no weapons in his Bo○d car? Even if it’s someone of his caliber, he might simply die, you know?」<br/>
「Please don’t confuse the vehicle used for traveling together with a spy car. Hajime-san, since when did you join the spy agency of England? It feels like Magdanese-san will be really happy then……ah, no, I’ll take back my words. It feels like it will give even more damage that will be beyond healing to Magdanese-san’s stomach.」<br/>
In any case, something like a vehicle without a weapon wasn’t a vehicle was the fixation that Hajime wouldn’t concede. And that seemed to be connected with why he pulled the boat out now.<br/>
All the Arachne-sans quickly clung to here and there on the boat and began their improvement work.<br/>
「I get it already. I’m hungry, so let’s quickly go to the restaurant.」<br/>
「……How strange. I get the feeling that Shia is looking at me like I’m a troubled guy……」<br/>
Shia pulled the hand of Hajime, who was making a look that wanted to comment on how upsetting the whole thing was, and this time it was her who started walking while dragging Hajime behind.<br/>
Since coming back home from the other world, whether it was Hajime or Yue, both of them sometimes caused Shia to take this kind of attitude as though she was dealing with a hopeless person. Depending on the situation, there were also times when she got plain angry……<br/>
Compared to when they first met, it wasn’t like Hajime didn’t get the feeling that their positions were oddly reversed.<br/>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <br/>
The cooking of the restaurant they visited was rather delicious; just like the villagers recommended. Taking the meal on a wooden terrace that was protruding out into the river was also not bad with how it was giving an effective modifier to the place category.<br/>
It seemed that Shia was pleased with the steamed cooking of freshwater fish, as she was passionately trying to steal the taste since some time ago.<br/>
Everyone recognized the handmade cooking skill of the rabbit who was almighty in housekeeping. She had also completely learned the taste of the Nagumo family; so despite the cooking duty being done in rotations if it was asked who the head chef who was entrusted the most with the Nagumo family’s kitchen was, then the answer would unanimously be Shia.<br/>
「Fumu fumu. I somehow get it, but in the first place, what seems like will be the most trouble is whether the spice can be obtained in Japan.」<br/>
「You’ll surely find it if you search. And if not, you can just come here to buy it using Gate.」<br/>
「……Now that Hajime-san mentioned it, that’s right. Hajime-san is too all-purposeful that I’ll turn deprived of the convenience.」<br/>
「If it’s for the sake of Shia’s handmade cooking, then I won’t hesitate to use everything I got.」<br/>
「Err……I’m really happy that Hajime-san says that, but those are profoundly memorable important words that were said the previous night before we were taking down the emperor’s castle, so I wish that it won’t be said lightly for something gluttonous……」<br/>
Once, when Shia kept her mouth shut from being stuck between her family’s determination and her reservation toward Hajime, Hajime gave her those words. Those words were one of several "important words" inside Shia. And so, her expression became really complicated.<br/>
But, the one in question, Hajime himself, showed not even the slightest sign of joking around. Rather he said those words just now with an expression that was even stiffer than the previous night before taking down the emperor’s castle.<br/>
「Calling it "light" is really a cruel remark. After all, Shia has firmly taken hold of my stomach. If it’s for the sake of Shia’s handmade cooking, I’ll even pick a fight against the world. I won’t hold back.」<br/>
「My, my handmade cooking as the trigger of a war!? Tha, that’s heavy desuu.」<br/>
Even while she was saying that, if one looked at her rabbit ears whooshing around it was clearly obvious how happy she was. 「Or rather, what kind of situation will make Hajime-san pick a fight with the world for my cooking? I don’t get the meaning at all~」 Shia muttered such things while poking the food with her fork and doing her best to hold back her mouth from grinning widely.<br/>
The atmosphere of the two was meal terrorism in a sense, with how it forcefully changed the food in the area to become a "sugary taste". Inside the restaurant that was quite bustling, there were various guests, but those who were male and came by themselves felt like clicking their tongues.<br/>
There was also the fact of how Shia was an exceptionally beautiful girl.<br/>
Actually, since she first entered the restaurant, she was gathering quite a lot of gazes. Even the restaurant’s staff were stealing glances at her, and the guests who entered after would also surely take one or two glances at Shia.<br/>
Also because normally there would be Yue and others around her, people would recognize her as "one of the beauties", but originally she was a possessor of beauty that couldn’t help but gather attention even by herself.<br/>
Hajime gazed at the embarrassed Shia with gentle eyes. In order to hide her embarrassment, Shia stuffed her cheeks *hamu-hamu-hamu* with food. Hajime-san watched with even more fondness at her acting like that……<br/>
「Geez. Ple, please don’t stare at me like that~」<br/>
「Where should I look then huh.」<br/>
Hajime spoke with a wry smile. Depending on how to perceive those words, they could also be heard like 「There is nothing else that I should see except Shia」 or 「I want to look at Shia all the time」.<br/>
In fact, the male faction inside the restaurant perceived Hajime’s words like that. They gritted their teeth audibly and clicked their tongue with a lot of jealousy filling the sound.<br/>
A male restaurant staff member let his jealousy drive him and put down the dish he was carrying on the table hard. The hot soup splashed on a male customer and a scream 「Hoott!?」 echoed.<br/>
*boguu* Such a graphic sound resounded. It seemed there was a male customer receiving a golden right hook straight from the female he was taking on a date.<br/>
It seemed only the seats of the two had a different atmosphere around them. If it took place in a two-dimensional world, then there would be hearts floating around them. Above all else, Shia’s happily smiling face, which was filled with embarrassment and happiness, produced a lot of shot victim.<br/>
Right now, the sound *splash-* that could be heard must be the sound of a man walking on the road beside the terrace falling into the river. 「Aa~」 such a voice could be heard vanishing into the distance. It was unknown how far that man would be carried away by the stream.<br/>
If Yue was charming people like a moon bewitchingly shining in the night, then Shia was charming people like a sunny spot that was scattering happiness around warmly. Although the vector of the two was different, the demon king’s rabbit possessed a charm that wasn’t superior or inferior from the bewitching vampire princess.<br/>
But, at that time, Hajime looked like he was taking a breather.<br/>
「Could it be, the improvement has finished?」<br/>
「Yeah. It’s properly armed now. A total of four small gatling gun placements on the back, front, left, and right. Then 120 pencil missiles. It’s also loaded with torpedoes and mines, twenty of each. I’m a bit uneasy with the firepower, but well, it’s okay, I guess, for a quick job. With this, it’s become a safer vehicle more or less.」<br/>
Hajime smiled in satisfaction. Shia went 「Rather it’s a mass of dangerous things desuu」 with her rabbit ears going limp.<br/>
And then, her rabbit ears caught a sound *kasa kasa* that caused her to shudder reflexively. When she turned her gaze toward her feet, all the Arachne-san, who had finished their tasks, were currently gushing forth from the terrace floor’s gap.<br/>
They skillfully used their legs and gave a smart salute before they were enveloped by light one after another, returning into the Treasure Warehouse.<br/>
Shia thought, 「Those Arachne-san, they are controlled by Hajime-san, right? Somehow I feel a sense of self from them, but that must be my imagination, right?」. It was scary, so she didn’t ask.<br/>
「Hajime-san, it’s better not to show those Arachne-san in front of Kaori-san or Shizuku-san, you know? I was raised in the sea of trees, so I’m all right with insects, but even someone like me shuddered a little seeing a lot of Arachne-san.」<br/>
Also, they strangely felt like they had their own will — countless wills at that. Shia whispered so inside her heart while giving Hajime a warning.<br/>
Hajime averted his gaze.<br/>
「……Hajime-san has a criminal record already, don’t you?」<br/>
「Shizuku was……unable to go out of her room for a while.」<br/>
To go further, everything that looked like a gap inside the room had tough planks nailed on them so that transmutation wouldn’t work, and she holed up inside there. Just like how Goddess Amaterasu was hiding inside the Heavenly Rock Cave, it was a hardship to make Shizuku come out.<br/>
「Of all people Hajime-san showed it to Shizuku-san, whose reaction is the most feminine……Just what are you doing?」<br/>
「I’m also reflecting on that. You see, Shuuzou-san said to me "I’m thinking of a renovation, can you help with making a huge underground space?", so I used a lot of Arachne for construction work, but……」<br/>
「Shizuku-san unexpectedly encountered them, is that it?」<br/>
「They had just finished the first phase and were returning from the underground. It was then, while they were gushing out in large amounts from the house’s garden, she saw them.」<br/>
Hajime could also use Gate to teleport inside Shizuku’s room and persuaded her there, but it felt like it would have the opposite effect instead; so Hajime, together with the disciples of the Yaegashi-style, did various things under the operation that was named "Shizuku-ojou(young miss), Heavenly Rock Cave Operation!" so that she would come out voluntarily.<br/>
In any case, the disciples of the Yaegashi-style were proficient in doing performances. Very much so. To the level that made Shizuku spontaneously peek out from the gap of her door and think「What? What are they doing? Why are they looking like they having so much fun?」<br/>
Hearing that kind of story, Shia directed a pitying gaze to the far away Japan while thinking that next time she would let Shizuku fluff her rabbit ears to her heart’s content.<br/>
But, at that time, a commotion suddenly entered Shia’s rabbit ears. 「Oh?」 When she turned her gaze to the direction of the commotion, a group of what seemed to be foreigners were already gathering around Triana unnoticed.<br/>
「Hajime-san, Hajime-san. People are gathering around the boat, you know?」<br/>
「Hm? ……Are they sightseeing because its color is different from other boats? Well, leave them alone. It moves using magic power, so no matter what they do it’s impossible to steal it.」<br/>
「That’s true.」<br/>
Shia also returned to her meal while feeling a bit curious. What bothered her was that they didn’t look like tourists…….<br/>
Or rather, they didn’t even look like respectable people. Several of them looked like normal people, but the people surrounding them, as though guarding them, were emitting auras that were unique to people who were familiar to violence.<br/>
Although, there was no way they could become a threat to the both of them, so Shia acted as though it didn’t bother her.<br/>
But, it seemed it was them who had business with Hajime and Shia.<br/>
A highly strung middle-aged man with blond hair that had been mostly receding was pointing at Triana while asking something to a man nearby who seemed to be a local.<br/>
The local male shook his head, but when he called out to other people who seemed to be his acquaintances, although they looked puzzled, they still pointed at Hajime and Shia who were continuing their meal on the terrace.<br/>
They must be saying that although they weren’t a hundred percent sure, those two might be the owner of Triana.<br/>
There was also a man with a well-featured face like an actor beside the man who looked high strung. When he looked at Hajime and Shia, his gaze stopped on Shia. And then he raised a voice of admiration that sounded exactly like an actor.<br/>
With the "highly strung" and the "sham actor" in the lead, a man who looked like a secretary, and five men who seemed to be bodyguards, were heading toward the terrace in a group.<br/>
「Uhee. They are coming here Hajime-san.」<br/>
「Leave it to me. I’ve often been told recently that I have "become mellow".  I’ll show you how I can settle this amicably with a peaceful and cultured communication.」<br/>
「I somehow can see the future already.」<br/>
Shia’s characteristic magic "Future Sight" didn’t activate. This was this thing that was commonly referred to as "pretend". It could also be called cliché.<br/>
"Highly strung" was making a rude entrance into the terrace. And then he soon stood in front of the two’s table.<br/>
「Oi, you two. Is that boat yours? I’ll buy it with cash. This is enough, right?」<br/>
Without letting the other party get a say, he slapped a roll of banknotes loudly on the table. His voice was like a monkey going ‘kiii kii’, and his gaze was glaring hard. From the start, he didn’t have any intention of hearing their opinion. It seemed he was thinking that there was no way his demand wouldn’t go through.<br/>
Those glaring eyes turned toward the muscular men who were standing by threateningly behind him. He was intending to make his will become known using more than words.<br/>
Against such a person, Hajime peacefully<br/>
「Aaa?」<br/>
「Hih!?」<br/>
The "highly strung" lost the strength in his waist! The fiendish eye gleam that would make even a yakuza run away barefooted tormented the nerves of the "highly strung"!<br/>
The bodyguards’ hands moved to their waists or their breast pockets reflexively.<br/>
But, before they could take out something, Shia’s voice resounded.<br/>
「Hajime-san! Hajime-san! You’re a peaceful and cultured person!」<br/>
「Oops.」<br/>
Hajime patted his own face. What next appeared was an expression that was truly gentle and peaceful. If they hadn’t seen the evil countenance just a moment before, then they would surely think that it was truly the amiable expression of a Japanese person. But right now, that change instead made it scarier.<br/>
「I’m really sorry, but I have no plans to sell that boat. If it’s a boat you want there are a lot of other boats. How about you take a look at another place?」<br/>
「Hih!?」<br/>
The "highly strung" was backing away while still sitting on the ground.<br/>
「……Shia, what is the meaning of this? I was treating him gently, right? Why is that guy scared?」<br/>
「That’s obviously because Hajime-san showed him what lies behind that smile first.」<br/>
Hajime whose expression wanted to say ‘I don’t get it’ caused Shia to make a straight man retort to him.<br/>
Then the "sham actor" came forward.<br/>
「Oh no my apologies, to suddenly intrude without even introducing ourselves. The one losing his legs there is Brandon. While I am Wilford. Nice to make your acquaintance.」<br/>
The "sham actor" also known as Wilford put his hand on his chest and respectfully──or rather with a gesture that was excessively theatrical──greeted them with a bow.<br/>
「To be able to encounter a young Japanese man with such an inspiring aura and a beautiful lady like yourself in this kind of place, truly a trip is really a good thing.」<br/>
The smile looked appropriate on the man. He looked like he was familiar with his own charm. If seen from nearby, he was truly a handsome man that would make anyone understand why he had self-confidence. His age must be around the early thirties. He also had an adult sex appeal that if it was a normal girl, their cheeks would redden unconsciously.<br/>
Wilford smiled sweetly at Shia and presented his hand gently. Because Shia’s hand was in the direction where his hand was going, perhaps he was intending to make "the greeting of kissing the back of the hand".<br/>
「??」<br/>
Shia was plainly puzzled and put the fish her fork stabbed on Wilford’s palm. It seemed that she thought Wilford-san was a gourmet and wanted to say to her 「That fish look delicious so share it with me」.<br/>
Hajime almost snorted reflexively while Wilford’s expression was twitching. Even so, he said 「This is, thank you so much」 while eating the fish on his palm. His guts were quite something.<br/>
「Cough cough. And, Mr. Wilford. Is your business the same as that man said before?」<br/>
「Unfortunately for the two of you, that’s correct. No matter what we wish to purchase that splendid boat from the two of you. Can I please ask you to accommodate our request somehow? If it’s money, we will pay your asking price. Of course, there will be a limit if we are using cash though……」<br/>
As Wilford said that he took out a check from his pocket. He must be telling them to write any amount they liked. It was a terrifyingly lavish attitude.<br/>
「We are a research team from the Reletense company. Brandon is the researcher, while I……am someone like a businessman. This will fall under necessary expenses so write down your price without reservation.」<br/>
Hajime titled his head toward Wilford who was saying such a thing with a jesting attitude.<br/>
「If this isn’t a personal project, then you should be coming quite prepared, right? Why are you doing something like the negotiation of a boat transaction? It should be something that you prepared or arranged beforehand, right?」<br/>
「There was an unexpected situation. Life is something that is always moving to an unforeseen bad direction. We have secured boats to some degree, but in our situation, it’s still a bit lacking. A boat with good performance that is.」<br/>
Perhaps it was a miss in the arrangement or perhaps it was the local people who broke the contract at the last moment. In any case, it seemed they lacked the number of boats.<br/>
Come to think of it, the line of SUVs they caught sight of before if Wilford and his group were riding inside those, then certainly they must have quite the number of personnel and equipment. If their people here weren’t all of them, then it seemed to be a fairly large research team.<br/>
However, Hajime’s answer was already decided. No matter the reason, he couldn’t hand over something like a boat that only moved by using magic power. There wasn’t any meaning to giving it to them.<br/>
「My bad. I want to cooperate here, but that boat is specially made. I cannot hand it over no matter how much money you stack up.」<br/>
「Can I ask you to please do something about it?」<br/>
Wilford asked doggedly. His words were polite. His face was also smiling. But……joviality was slipping from his eyes.<br/>
It seemed this man was far more dangerous than Mr. Brandon.<br/>
「I told you already, it’s impossible. If it’s a boat, then there are a lot here. Look for one in another place.」<br/>
「Your boat is good. I only looked briefly, but with the condition of all the boats here, it won’t be strange if they breakdown anytime. With more time we will be able to procure quite some good boats, but we don’t want to waste that much time.」<br/>
「I understand your circumstance. But, even so, I cannot. My bad.」<br/>
Shia was sending Hajime a gaze that was full of admiration while saying 「Oo~, Hajime-san is properly persuading others with words!」. Was that how much she thought he was a person whose thoughts were negotiation = violence……. Hajime felt a bit wounded.<br/>
「Hmmm. This is troubling. I thought that if it’s a Japanese person, then compromising is their specialty, but……. it seems that the youngsters these days are bad at reading the atmosphere. No, peace idiots always exist anywhere. Perhaps it can’t be helped that you lack a sense of danger.」<br/>
A cold gaze poured forth from Wilford to Hajime. That gaze could even be called inhuman. Normal people who got that gaze directed at them would tremble from a chill. Those eyes were also slowly moving toward Shia.<br/>
Wilford’s fingertip made a beckoning motion. Following that, a large-bodied and tough looking man came forward and bared open his jacket slowly. There was a handgun there.<br/>
「What do you think? For the sake of your lovely lover too, won’t you allow this negotiation to end productively by all means here?」<br/>
「Negotiation? I think that you are mistaking it with a threat though.」<br/>
Hajime snorted mockingly. Wilford’s eyes narrowed slowly. The bodyguard was moving to circle behind Shia.<br/>
It was unthinkable that they would shoot in midday in front of the public, but what if they pressed the gun muzzle up against someone and threatened that if they moved away from there……such a thing was possible enough.<br/>
「Good grief, it’s unbelievable that these guys are corporate workers. Or perhaps, is your company some kind of private military or something?」<br/>
「Now, I wonder about that──」<br/>
Wilford showed a cruel smile; however, his words halted.<br/>
*clack* He saw the thing that was placed on the table.<br/>
「……」<br/>
「Even if I shot you guys to death right now, looking at the gun you guys are keeping in your pockets, it will undoubtedly be justified self-defense. After all, we here are a young couple. While your side is a mysterious organization. There are also a lot of witnesses seeing you guys surrounding us like this.」<br/>
Everyone’s gaze was fixed on the bizarre large revolver. No matter how they looked at, it was a custom made order. What’s more, it looked well used. And the terrifying thing was, even though they were all paying attention to Hajime all this time, they didn’t notice the gun until the moment he pulled it out.<br/>
「……I think that you should put the number of people into your consideration though?」<br/>
「I absolutely don’t care.」<br/>
The sound of gulping saliva could be heard from the experienced bodyguards.<br/>
At the same time, there was the abnormal pressure overflowing from Hajime. Certainly, the mood that a difference in numbers wouldn’t make any difference was permeating the air.<br/>
「……Who are you? Don’t tell me; you are aiming for "that" just like us?」<br/>
「? That?」<br/>
「Chih. So it’s only a case of us pulling a bad card huh. Really, life is something that moves in unexpected directions.」<br/>
Wilford clicked his tongue; then his hand made a gesture to back down while his expression looked like he had bitten something sour. The bodyguards pulled back slowly.<br/>
「Sorry to have bothered you. We will look for a boat at another place.」<br/>
「……I see. What’s important is that we can understand each other.」<br/>
Wilford shrugged his shoulders, then easily turned around and left. Brandon followed behind him in a panic, and the bodyguards were leaving the restaurant while staying on guard against Hajime up to the end.<br/>
「What’s with those people I wonder.」<br/>
「Who knows. In any case, they aren’t decent people for sure. Nothing beats not getting involved with them.」<br/>
Hajime shrugged his shoulders while staring sadly at the food that had become cold. He then resumed eating.<br/>
Shia also followed suit and resumed eating while whispering inside her heart.<br/>
(No matter how you think about it a flag has just been raised desuu. We are absolutely going to be involved with those people again! Because this is Hajime-san we are talking about!)<br/>
The future prediction of Shia’s, whose vocation was "Fortune Teller", was……no, even if it wasn’t Shia, anyone who knew Hajime could easily predict that.<br/>
The correctness of that prediction……<br/>
Would be proven as early as today.<br/>
