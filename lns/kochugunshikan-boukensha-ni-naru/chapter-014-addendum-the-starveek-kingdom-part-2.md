                                      Translator: SFBaka                                              <br/>
<br/>
I was led into a room where I found the earl along with a nobleman who seemed to be his aide.<br/>
"I am truly sorry to have requested your presence at this ungodly hour Royal Princess," the earl started.<br/>
"It’s alright. More importantly, what seems to be the matter?"<br/>
"We’ve just received word from the capital. A rebellion has broken out."<br/>
I jerked in surprise after hearing the sudden grave news and endured the urge to cry out.<br/>
"How large is the scale?"<br/>
"I cannot say for certain, but I estimate the rebel elements to include sixty to seventy percent of the southern and western noble houses, twenty to thirty percent of the eastern and northern nobles and sixty percent of the military."<br/>
I swiftly calculated the numbers mentioned. So it’s more than half of the nobility and the army…<br/>
"Which side are you on, your Lordship?"<br/>
After hearing my question, Fal moved her hand to her sword’s hilt, ready to draw it at a moment’s notice.<br/>
"Your Highness… no, my dear niece Cleria; do not ask me such a thing. Our Ludvic house has sworn its unwavering loyalty to the Starvine royal house instead of the Starveek kingdom since its inception three hundred years ago. Your misgivings are misplaced."<br/>
"I’m sorry, uncle. I was just too upset. Please forgive me."<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Yes, it would not be good if I was unable to properly determine friend from foe and mistrust my closest allies. If he were against us, my uncle would not have informed me of the rebellion in the first place.<br/>
I then asked my uncle for the details of the rebellion.<br/>
It all began twenty days ago, when my father summoned the military minister Lord Alois under the pretense of wanting to discuss something with him, which he promptly ignored.<br/>
They then attempted to reach out to the military officials staying near the royal palace to inquire about the matter, but found that they were no longer able to contact them as well. Two days after the summons, Lord Alois rallied his soldiers and raised the flag of rebellion. A good portion of the nobility matched their timing and participated as well.<br/>
The royal capital ended up being sealed off and the royal palace was besieged by the army and fell three days after.<br/>
"What about my father!? My mother and brother!?"<br/>
My uncle grimly shook his head.<br/>
They were all executed on the square in front of the royal castle. They were charged with high treason for allegedly selling out the kingdom to the neighboring Holy State of Aram.<br/>
"What!? How utterly ridiculous!"<br/>
The Holy State of Aram was a neighboring country which raided our borders from time to time.<br/>
"I know. I’m sure no one, friend or foe alike, actually believe in such a flimsy accusation."<br/>
"Kuh! We need to recapture the royal capital immediately!"<br/>
"Your Highness, it would be best if you first gather the forces of the east and north under your name in order to properly oppose the rebels."<br/>
It certainly is as my uncle says. Our enemies are composed of nobles and a considerable part of the army. They won’t be felled by half-hearted forces.<br/>
"I’m very sorry uncle. I was too hasty and blood just rushed to the top of my head."<br/>
"Do not worry, Princess. I understand your feelings. My esteemed king and my cute little sister were both humiliated and butchered under their hands. I’ll absolutely make them pay the price!"<br/>
My uncle’s aura suddenly turned murderous.<br/>
I then proceeded to write letters all morning which were to be delivered to the nearby noble houses. Their content was a call to arms following the events in the royal capital. Over two hundred knights were sent out to deliver my letters to the noble houses of the eastern and northern domains.<br/>
But I noticed something strange after the third day since sending out the messengers.<br/>
There was no response up until now. At the very least, the lords from the territories near the earldom should have given us a reply already. None of the knights entrusted with delivering the letters came back as well. An unpleasant premonition comes over me.<br/>
Finally, on the morning of the fourth day, a noble leading his private forces arrived in the earldom. Judging from the flag they were flying, it was the forces of Baron Arseny, who uncle regards as his right-hand man.<br/>
I welcomed the baron together with my uncle.<br/>
"Your Royal Highness! You were safe? Thank the Goddess Ruminas!"<br/>
"It has been a long time Baron. However, what do you mean?"<br/>
I looked at the baron quizzically. My uncle and his aide’s faces suddenly paled.<br/>
"Yes, well… I did not know that Your Highness actually came here."<br/>
"That can’t be! Did you not receive my letter?"<br/>
"No, I have never received any sort of letter from Your Highness. I just learned about the rebellion in the capital two days ago and asked the Ludvic house for instructions, but I never received a response. That’s why I came here directly."<br/>
"Damnation! So those messengers really were intercepted!"<br/>
My uncle was horrified.<br/>
I was finally able to grasp what was happening. All of the messengers never reached their intended destinations.<br/>
"Your Highness, perhaps they have been planning this rebellion for years. They are far too prepared."<br/>
"What happened to the messengers?"<br/>
"They may have all been killed already. The rebels may have stationed groups of soldiers on the main roads. They must have intercepted the messengers and got rid of them since the enemies outnumber them."<br/>
"Conversely, if we assemble a large enough number of troops, they would not be able to lay siege to them as easily. We should dispatch a sufficient number of scouts immediately."<br/>
My Goddess! How frighteningly thorough…<br/>
The scout troops were soon assembled along with troops tasked to eliminate the enemy soldiers stationed on the main roads.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
The troops set out. This deployment lasted for a couple of days.<br/>
We finally grasped a rough handle of the situation due to the soldier’s efforts.<br/>
The enemy should be comprised of 40,000 soldiers, a majority of which came from the military.<br/>
The private troops of the southern and western nobles were mixed in as well.<br/>
They were currently moving against the noble houses who are still putting up a resistance, sieging their castles.<br/>
They hold their entire territories hostage while proposing for the ruling nobles to surrender and come to the royal capital with their families, on the condition that they will relinquish their rights to their lands and hand that responsibility to the rebels.<br/>
The enemy forces have already invaded deeply into the eastern and northern domains, and even if the remaining nobles loyal to the Royal Family tried to muster their forces and gather up, there’s a good chance they would be intercepted along the way and eliminated one by one.<br/>
We continued to receive these kinds of grievous news. I took in all these reports while feeling dumbfounded.<br/>
At this rate, even if we do somehow manage to gather some forces, it won’t number more than 5,000 men.<br/>
While I was ruminating our dismal situation, uncle addressed me.<br/>
"We just received word that the castle of Count David has fallen. The enemy’s main force shall be coming here in half a day’s time."<br/>
I have long prepared myself for such an outcome.<br/>
"I understand. We shall meet the enemy head-on and show them the strength of our resolve!"<br/>
"Spoken like a true Starvine. Your courage is most admirable."<br/>
"However, I would want Your Highness to escape from here if possible."<br/>
"Do not say such absurd things! Do you want me to live on in shame uncle!?"<br/>
"You would not be living in disgrace, Your Highness. I want you to go to the Belta Kingdom."<br/>
Berta Kingdom? It was a neighboring country; however, one needs to cross the wildlands in order to reach it.<br/>
"I do not know much about Berta Kingdom. But Irena-sama, the little sister of your grandmother Erika-sama, had married over to that kingdom as queen. In other words, the Belta Kingdom’s current king, Amado-sama, is Cleria-sama’s second cousin."<br/>
"Do you want me to seek aid from the Belta Kingdom?"<br/>
"Precisely. But I believe they would not be able to make it in time to quell this rebellion if they do decide to lend aid. And even if you appeal to them personally Princess, the possibility of the Belta Kingdom sending us aid is still quite low."<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
That’s true. Surely if the situation was reversed and it was the Belta Kingdom who is asking for aid, Starveek Kingdom will also hesitate in sending subjects who could possibly die in foreign soil.<br/>
"Even so, we want to preserve an ember of hope. Even if this kingdom is shattered, we still hope that it can be rebuilt once more and rise from the ashes."<br/>
"If so, then please help me uncle. Let us revive this kingdom together."<br/>
"No, I am a proud vassal of the Starvine royal house. Please allow me to make a stand here."<br/>
"If you surrender…"<br/>
My uncle immediately cut me off.<br/>
"Your Highness, considering the relationship between us and the Starvine royal house, my life will definitely not be spared. And even if I do manage to survive after surrendering, all that awaits next is the abolishment of the Ludvic house. I would rather choose to make a final stand and keep my pride instead of bowing in defeat without struggling."<br/>
Even if I and my entourage of royal guards stayed and fought here, our meager numbers would not be able to change the inevitable outcome. Then would it truly be better to preserve an ember of hope as my uncle wishes?<br/>
My uncle then knelt down and implored me.<br/>
"Your Royal Highness, if I may be so bold as to request one final thing of you."<br/>
"Speak."<br/>
"Your Highness also has the blood of the Ludvic house flowing through your veins. Considering our three hundred years of unwavering service and loyalty to the Starvine royal house, I beseech you to revive the Ludvic house one day."<br/>
I have no reason to refuse such a request.<br/>
"I understand. I will definitely revive the Ludvic house without fail. I swear this upon the name of the Goddess Ruminas."<br/>
I activated my mana and swore upon the name of the Goddess. My body emitted a soft glow as proof of the vow.<br/>
"Wahaha! I am most grateful Your Highness!"<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Thus, my escape was decided. We immediately began preparations for departure.<br/>
"We have prepared eight carriage groups for this occasion, equal to the number of roads leading out of our lands."<br/>
"Your Royal Highness will be among these eight groups along with your royal guard. Each individual carriage has soldiers assigned to them to serve as escorts as well. All carriages will depart at the same time; each heading out to a different road leading out of the territory. Of course, none of the soldiers are told exactly which carriage princess shall be riding in."<br/>
"They shall be heading to the Cecilio and Belta kingdoms respectively. However, the exact way towards the Belta kingdom is known only by the local hunters."<br/>
"We surmise that the enemy would most likely judge that you will be heading for the Cecilio kingdom. It is only a short distance away after all."<br/>
"Each carriage shall also be accompanied by scouts and rear troops. Despite the on-going rebellion, we don’t think that enemy troops would be stationed on the border roads leading out of the kingdom."<br/>
"The rebel forces have most likely already entered our lands, but they won’t be able to come in pursuit of you effectively if each carriage group heads out to eight different directions at the same time. The scouts and rear units are added insurance."<br/>
I see. The arrangements seem perfect so far.<br/>
The time for departure finally arrived. Only uncle and his aide saw us off.<br/>
"Here, Your Highness. These were entrusted by the king to be given to you before the royal palace fell. I apologize for handing them over only now," my uncle said as he handed something to me.<br/>
When I took a look, I saw three pieces of paper with words written on them. The first one said "Cleria, I’m so sorry," in my father’s handwriting. The second one was my mother’s which said: "I wish for your happiness my dear Cleria". The last one was my brother’s. It said, "I entrust the Starvine royal house to you". All of them seemed to have been hastily written out.<br/>
I forcefully held back my tears.<br/>
"Goodbye, uncle."<br/>
"Go child. Goddess Ruminas, I beseech thee! Please bless Cleria on this journey and keep her safe."<br/>
