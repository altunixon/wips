<br/>
This only took me 4 hours and I didn’t even procrastinate that much o_0<br/>
I must still be influenced by the Spirit of Christmas.<br/>
Oh and in case you haven’t realised, 171 is done and the chapter has been updated.<br/>
Merry Christmas guys ~^^~<br/>
Barbarian Armour + 2<br/>
After I finished talking with the Queen, I made an appearance at the Weapon Shop.<br/>
"Oh. Well isn’t it Laddie. It’s been a while." (Oyaji)<br/>
"So it has. I haven’t seen you guys much because of your thriving business." (Naofumi)<br/>
I was finally able to meet the Old Man from the weapon shop.<br/>
Imia’s Uncle was also there as a shop assistant, lining up weapons in the store.<br/>
There’s a better array of products than before.<br/>
They looked busy, and business seems good.<br/>
"How are you?" (Naofumi)<br/>
"We’re pretty good. Just a little longer and it’ll be finished. The shield for Laddie, that is." (Oyaji)<br/>
"I see. How much should I pay?" (Naofumi)<br/>
"You let me work this guy freely so 10 gold for the material fees is fine." (Oyaji)<br/>
The Old Man from the Weapon Shop said generously, pointing at Imia’s Uncle.<br/>
It’s a masterpiece made with the materials from the Spirit Turtle. So it’s likely that it’s as fine as the products on auction in Zeltbur.<br/>
Moreover, it’s made by the Old Man so it might fetch an even higher price.<br/>
The problem is what to do with the shield after I’ve Copied it….<br/>
Because amongst the guys I have faith in with handling it, there are none who use shields.<br/>
"The average market price would be 50 gold, right." (Imia’s Uncle)<br/>
Imia’s Uncle replied, as if reading my thoughts.<br/>
It’s the Shield version of the displayed Spirit Turtle Sword that had been scheduled for auction in Zeltbur before.<br/>
It’s a product made by the Old Man, and its performance can be expected.<br/>
The problem is its cost.<br/>
Well the current me can afford to pay 10 gold.<br/>
Because I’ve earned that much from managing the land.<br/>
Or rather, when spending money to provide for war power to fight the waves, preparing weapons and armour is the most important.<br/>
It seems cheap, but if it was 50 gold then it would still cause some hesitation.<br/>
"Is it that much of a quality product?" (Naofumi)<br/>
"Yes. If there’s no way to use it then having the outlook of selling it is also part of a merchant." (Imia’s Uncle)<br/>
The Old Man also nodded.<br/>
But still….to part with the product that they worked hard to make for me is a bit regrettable.<br/>
I want to have it on hand even if it ends up gathering dust.<br/>
"Well, I’ll think about that when the time comes. How’s the armour?" (Naofumi)<br/>
"It was a good core. With that, there will be no problems inserting it. With those thoughts, we made that first." (Oyaji)<br/>
At the Old Man’s instructions, Imia’s Uncle brought the armour from the shop’s interior.<br/>
Its appearance was very similar to the previously equipped Barbarian’s Armour.<br/>
However, looking again at the fundamental materials, the metal parts were appended with turtleshell material.<br/>
Also, a few of the dark-coloured joints became colourful.<br/>
"This is?" (Naofumi)<br/>
"We used metal yielded from the Spirit Turtle. There were a few problems with the weight but we’ve already fixed that flaw. Mysteriously, it became lighter after we affixed the core." (Oyaji)<br/>
"I see." (Naofumi)<br/>
I examined the Barbarian’s Armour.<br/>
Barbarian’s Armour + 2?<br/>
Defence Up    Shock Resistance (Large)    Fire Resistance (Extra Large)   Lightning Resistance (Large) Absorbtion Resistance (Mid)   HP Recovery (Weak)   Magic Recovery (Weak)   SP Recovery (Weak)   Magic Increase (Mid)   Dragon Emperor’s Divine Protection   Magic Defence Production   Automatic Repair Function   Earth Pulse’s Divine Protection   Dragon Attribute   Dragon Territory   Growing Ability<br/>
There are even more endowments.<br/>
A variety of things are increased in return for the loss of Dark Resistance.<br/>
Was the Fire Resistance thanks to the core?<br/>
There’s also the Dragon Attribute. The dragon aspects probably correspond to Gaelion’s core being used.<br/>
What’s Dragon Territory? The growing ability was an effect I somehow came to expect.<br/>
I should ask Gaelion.<br/>
"How much is the fee?" (Naofumi)<br/>
"Laddie will make good use of it so take it as commission for being the liaison for the materials." (Oyaji)<br/>
"That’s helpful." (Naofumi)<br/>
"It’s because I profited from that. To charge you money here, my pride won’t allow it." (Oyaji)<br/>
The Old Man really did a lot for me, I’ve always considered him the second most trustworthy after Raphtalia.<br/>
It’s really disappointing that he won’t come to my land though.<br/>
"Can I wear it immediately?" (Naofumi)<br/>
"Sure! Show us." (Oyaji)<br/>
I took the Armour and went to the dressing room to change.<br/>
For some reason, despite it feeling familiar, it feels brand new.<br/>
Such a mysterious feeling. This….<br/>
However, there’s no great change in design. Just the colouring is different.<br/>
"Hm?" (Naofumi)<br/>
The cotton-like texture is different. I understand that something good has been used.<br/>
I’ve received a fine product.<br/>
The sizing is also correct, it fits perfectly.<br/>
"How is it?" (Naofumi)<br/>
"Oh, when speaking of Laddie, it’s that kind of image as expected." (Oyaji)<br/>
"Um… I find it hard to understand but, some growth is….in regards to Hero-sama….there isn’t any." (Imia’s Uncle)<br/>
Imia’s Uncle says ambiguously.<br/>
Of course it’s like that….the Old Man was pleased, but I also thought it was a fin-de-siècle small fry at first. [T/N: Fin de siècle = end of the century. http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fin_de_si%C3%A8cle]<br/>
However, I feel the illusion of being very powerful just by wearing this.<br/>
Because as far as I’m concerned, this armour made with the Old Man’s confidence is the most reliable armour.<br/>
Raphtalia said she wanted to be my sword.<br/>
And the Old Man granted me with this armour.<br/>
In regards to armour, the production of this Barbarian’s Armour is the best indeed.<br/>
"Thank You." (Naofumi)<br/>
"It’s been a while since I’ve heard Laddie’s thanks." (Oyaji)<br/>
"I just said it." (Naofumi)<br/>
"By the way, where’s the Miss? She hasn’t come at all." (Oyaji) [T/N: Miss = Raphtalia]<br/>
"She’s still in training." (Naofumi)<br/>
"Hmm…." (Oyaji)<br/>
"That’s right. Old Man, can you see the flow of magic?" (Naofumi)<br/>
"What’s that?" (Oyaji)<br/>
I tried explaining to the old man about how adding magic when cooking or compounding improves the quality.<br/>
"I don’t see it. But I do understand about adding magic." (Oyaji)<br/>
"Is that so." (Naofumi)<br/>
Well, I probably don’t do it as precisely as Laddie though. Will you try helping next time?" (Oyaji)<br/>
"I’ll think about it." (Naofumi)<br/>
"And also, it’s no good if you don’t listen carefully to the materials. Pushing is good but pulling is also important." (Oyaji)<br/>
Hmm… Adding magic is also important but there must be a guide or something, right.<br/>
Adding magic is fine when improving inferior products but if the foundation is good then it shouldn’t be put in?<br/>
Or was it like the Dragon Pulse method?<br/>
Hm? I feel like something flashed.<br/>
I should try it next time.<br/>
"Now then, I don’t want to overstay my welcome….Ah, that’s right. Can I have you make me another carriage?" (Naofumi)<br/>
"Hm? What happened?" (Oyaji)<br/>
"Firo’s reckless driving made the carriage do unreasonable things." (Naofumi)<br/>
"What the heck did she do." (Oyaji)<br/>
"A race on the mountain passes….she was competing on a mountain trail and jumped off a cliff." (Naofumi)<br/>
"What kind of situation is that!" (Oyaji)<br/>
As expected, the Old Man was also surprised.<br/>
Imia’s Uncle was the same as well.<br/>
"There won’t be a next time, so I’d like to request something similar to before." (Naofumi)<br/>
"I get it. I’ll make the frame so bring Miss Birdie along once, it’s better if I improve it to match her, right?" (Oyaji)<br/>
"Ah, then the next time we come." (Naofumi)<br/>
"Alright." (Oyaji)<br/>
"I will also return to the village soon." (Imia’s Uncle)<br/>
"So in the end, you’re coming?" (Naofumi)<br/>
"Temporarily. One way or another, it’s better if we make equipment for everyone in the village, right?" (Imia’s Uncle)<br/>
"Mn….That’s true." (Naofumi)<br/>
Even now, they’re still using second-hand weapons.<br/>
If I’m irresponsible and don’t replace them then they’ll get worn out.<br/>
I’m doing maintenance on them for now but it’ll probably reach a limit.<br/>
Imia has been exhibiting such skills. I’m hoping Imia’s Uncle also has a similar level of talent.<br/>
"I know who the Hero of the Shield-sama really wanted to come though." (Imia’s Uncle)<br/>
"No….that’s.." (Naofumi)<br/>
Uugh. This is awkward.<br/>
Certainly, I wanted the Old Man from the Weapon Shop to come.<br/>
Usually I would curtly refuse but that’s in comparison with the Old Man.<br/>
My apologies, but that’s what I really think…..<br/>
"Please don’t worry about it. I don’t have any intention to lose." (Imia’s Uncle)<br/>
"That’s right, Jeez, you’re not any less capable. I don’t think I could’ve finished that shield without you." (Oyaji)<br/>
"Because the Hero of the Shield has such expectations. I don’t have any choice but to do it. Or rather, I must do it." (Imia’s Uncle)<br/>
If the Old Man says so then his skills must be reliable.<br/>
Then I’ll be anticipating it.<br/>
"I’ll be looking forward to it. Should I gather materials from somewhere?" (Naofumi)<br/>
"Yes. And then, I’ll be grateful if you could make a Blacksmith’s Workshop for me." (Imia’s Uncle)<br/>
"Understood. If you tell the neighbouring town, there are some knowledgeable guys so you can leave it to them." (Naofumi)<br/>
It’s probably fine if I ask at the Accessory Shop.<br/>
One way or another, making accessories require the refining of metals and such anyway.<br/>
I know that such a workshop was built in the village.<br/>
Therefore, he should be able to make one in the village.<br/>
I’ll haggle as much as I can. He also communicates with the Slave Merchant and is a masochist so he’ll be delighted if I haggle.<br/>
Of course, I won’t let him cut corners with his construction.<br/>
"Then until later, when the shield is complete." (Naofumi)<br/>
"Ah, I’ll see you then…." (Oyaji)<br/>
And with that, I left the Weapon Shop behind.<br/>
