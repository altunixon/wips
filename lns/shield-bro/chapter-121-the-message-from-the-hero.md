Chapter 121: The Message from the Hero<br/>
"IT’s good that we jumped on the Turtle, but…" (Naofumi)<br/>
The ground is shaking. More specifically, the Spirit Turtle’s whole body is shaking.<br/>
But its head can’t stretch far enough to look at its back. I don’t think it can concentrate on its shell.<br/>
I check my surroundings.<br/>
The place we landed is quite close to the ruined city.<br/>
The buildings give off a Chinese sort of feeling. Possible because of the Chinese legend that the Spirit Turtle carried the city of immortals on its back.<br/>
"Firo, can you sense where the army is?" (Naofumi)<br/>
"nn… Probably… that way?" (Firo)<br/>
Firo points to the mountain range outside of the city.<br/>
That direction is towards the back of the Turtle, so she’s probably correct.<br/>
"For now, let’s leave the city and meet up." (Naofumi)<br/>
"Yes!" (Firo)<br/>
I get on Firo, and she runs towards the mountains.<br/>
… There are quite a few corpses littered around the ruined city. It seems the cause of death is attacks from the Spirit Turtle’s familiars.<br/>
The cause of all of this is those three idiotic heroes.<br/>
Why would they do such a thing…<br/>
The putrid smell of rotting bodies is making me feel sick.<br/>
"Master, please hold Firo tightly." (Firo)<br/>
"Sure." (Naofumi)<br/>
Firo runs while kicking Familiars that look like Gorillas and Yetis.<br/>
Along the way, a familiars that looked like floating eyeballs and bats also appeared. These ones seem to be more powerful than the others.<br/>
But none of them are a match for the speeding blur that is Firo.<br/>
We still have yet to get out of the city.<br/>
… For a while, I have been seeing nothing but carcasses.<br/>
As I think this, I see the shadow of a person.<br/>
I wonder if it is one of the Army Soldiers…<br/>
But it is definitely a corpse. The dead bodies on the turtle’s back have begun to move.<br/>
"Even after death, his body is being controlled by something… Something like that?" (Naofumi)<br/>
I’ve only ever seen Zombies in games. In reality, fighting them while looking at their decrepit faces is quite mortifying.<br/>
The only undead I have ever encountered before was Skeletons. Apparently, finding undead monsters that still had flesh is quite rare.<br/>
There’s no way I can fight these.<br/>
A child zombie appears and Firo is unable to kick.<br/>
"Let’s avoid it." (Naofumi)<br/>
Even though Firo will happily eat most humanoid monsters, even she cannot bring herself to fight a child.<br/>
"I’m sorry master…" (Firo)<br/>
With amazing leg power, Firo jumps out of the swarm of Zombies that had begun to form.<br/>
If they were doomed to have such a fate after death, it would have been better if they had been hit by the Turtle’s lightning and been obliterated without leaving a trace.<br/>
But I’m just stating my opinion here.<br/>
"That girl… looked a bit like Melty" (Firo)<br/>
Melty is in the castle, but Firo’s imagination is running wild.<br/>
I couldn’t see anything in that child that looked like Melty.<br/>
"Why would this Turtle make that child do such a thing?" (Firo)<br/>
Firo looks down at the ground.<br/>
That’s right. I can’t seem to see the turtle’s goal.<br/>
It’s not eating anything, it’s just going around and killing as many things as it can.<br/>
As if killing in itself was its goal.<br/>
"We need to hurry to Oneechan." (Firo)<br/>
"Yeah…?" (Naofumi)<br/>
I see a building that looks like a temple.<br/>
The architecture is not of eastern origin. It looks like a Greek temple from my world.<br/>
In a game, a building like this would usually contain a useful clue or key item.<br/>
"Please stop by that building." (Naofumi)<br/>
"Yes~" (Firo)<br/>
I carefully peer inside.<br/>
Perhaps due to the Turtle’s walking, the temple is half collapsed.<br/>
Is this the statue that the other heroes supposedly destroyed in here?<br/>
I search the temple but cannot find any artifact with a relation to the Turtle.<br/>
I should have probably gotten more information from the queen.<br/>
It seems that I am wasting my time.<br/>
"This is…!?" (Naofumi)<br/>
On a mural on the wall, I see some writing.<br/>
… It’s in Japanese.<br/>
"What is this…" (Naofumi)<br/>
If anyone is once again summoned here from japan… if you are reading this, please… this.<br/>
Th…Monster was se… but the… Seven Eye seal will probably… ek someday.<br/>
From what we learned, his purpose is………… and to protect this world’s……………..<br/>
I pray that the blue sand…… and the seal never breaks.<br/>
Though having more victims may benefit this world.<br/>
Looking back, we have paid a large price by sealing this monster<br/>
But… be… greed. If you… read these letters… for the… living in this world… defeat… Monster.<br/>
…way to defeat it is……………………….<br/>
… and then use the eight… courage… -Keiichi<br/>
(TL: The Hero’s name, I don’t know the exact pronunciation, 桂一)<br/>
(TL: BY THE WAY, THIS WAS REALLY A PAIN, I CAN’T REALLY HELP YOU DECYPHER THIS)<br/>
… The writing is faded and scratched out, so it is difficult to read.<br/>
But I can pretty much guess what is written by context.<br/>
Something like the seal we placed will someday break.<br/>
The dragon hourglass will turn blue and display a warning.<br/>
However, the Turtle’s objective and the ever-so-important sealing procedure are illegible.<br/>
More victims may benefit the world? Even though this was left by a hero, I cannot make sense of it.<br/>
And this isn’t an Anime or a Manga. Why is only the most important information omitted?<br/>
This writing seems to be very old, so I can’t really complain to anyone.<br/>
The only piece of info I really got was the person’s name, Keiichi.<br/>
I don’t know his last name, but there was definitely a Hero of that name.<br/>
Apart from the cracks caused by the turtle’s walking, this was already an old piece of writing. There isn’t much else I can learn from this.<br/>
There’s a high possibility he comes from a different Japan than me.<br/>
I don’t know how long ago this Mural was painted, and I’m not sure that this world even records its history accurately.<br/>
But thinking about this won’t really help anything.<br/>
Is the number eight connected to something? I can’t read any of the text around it.<br/>
…<br/>
"Can Master read this?" (Firo)<br/>
"Yeah, sort of." (Naofumi)<br/>
"hm… these letters are a little weird." (Firo)<br/>
"Yes, these are not letters used in Melromark." (Naofumi)<br/>
By the way, it seems that the countries around here all have different languages and writing systems.<br/>
The shield acts as a translator, so I can probably manage with the language barrier, but as for writing…<br/>
"There doesn’t seem to be anything else of interest, we should be on our way." (Naofumi)<br/>
"Yeah!" (Firo)<br/>
We leave the temple and continue towards the mountain.<br/>
"It will be difficult to locate Rafatalia and the others." (Naofumi)<br/>
We enter the mountain range and continue heading towards the turtle’s rear.<br/>
It looked like a rocky mountain from afar, but the base of the mountains are surrounded by dense forests. It will be difficult to find the army squadron.<br/>
From what I know, the legends say that there is a cave that leads into the Turtle somewhere around here, so the army is probably searching for a cave as well.<br/>
There is also a possibility the entrance was somewhere in that village.<br/>
And where are the other heroes, anyways?<br/>
They could be inside the Turtle fighting, but they could just as easily be lost searching for the entrance on top.<br/>
"Firo, can you sense the others?" (Naofumi)<br/>
"Over there I think." (Firo)<br/>
I leave navigations to Firo<br/>
Occasionally we find a soldier’s corpse lying around.<br/>
"We need to hurry." (Naofumi)<br/>
"Yes!" (Firo)<br/>
Firo speeds up, and we find the army squadron locked in battle.<br/>
Since their forces are very large, it is difficult to miss them.<br/>
Rafatalia is on the front lines destroying the familiars one after the other.  Those that can still move are aiding her in battle.<br/>
Rishia is frantically casting support magic from the rear.<br/>
There are also many who have deserted due to the onslaught of monsters.<br/>
"Alright Firo, We’re helping them!" (Naofumi)<br/>
"Yes!" (Firo)<br/>
Firo rushes in at the speed of sound and sends the familiars in front of Rafatalia flying with a kick.<br/>
"Naofumi-sama!" (Rafatalia)<br/>
"Yep, we’ve finally met up. What’s the situation?" (Naofumi)<br/>
"We are in the middle of looking for the cave." (Rafatalia)<br/>
"You still haven’t found it?" (Naofumi)<br/>
"According to the magic brigade, it is impossible to locate it with magic because the Turtle is constantly moving." (Rafatalia)<br/>
"Fumu…" (Naofumi)<br/>
So the troops have been manually searching for it whilst fending off attacks from these monsters.<br/>
The number of familiars seems to be infinite. That must have been difficult.<br/>
As I think this, an army recon squad comes running in.<br/>
"We have located a cave that seems to be the one we are looking for. Its appearance matches the one spoken of in legend." (Recon Person)<br/>
And the Reson squad leader points deeper into the mountains.<br/>
"That’s good. I’ll hold off the attacks, please lead us there." (Naofumi)<br/>
"Understood" (Recon Guy)<br/>
"Everyone, Follow the Hero of the Shield’s lead!" (Army person)<br/>
"SIR YES SIR" (Entire army)<br/>
We continue to drive off the familiars and proceed to the cave the Recon Squad found.<br/>
