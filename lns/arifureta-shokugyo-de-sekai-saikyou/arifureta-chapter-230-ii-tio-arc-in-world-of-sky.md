Arifureta After II   in a World of Sky<br/>
<br/>
The wind howled. Wind pressure was striking everything. If one looked up, they would see the vibrant azure sky. The light of the sun was brilliantly showering down. The sea of clouds was shining silver due to the reflection of the sunlight.<br/>
Surrounded by all those, there were two silhouettes freefalling with their arms folded.<br/>
「I wonder if it’s my fate to enter a cave, then freefall in the sky?」<br/>
「Who knows. But, at the very least, this art a refreshing fall compared to before, isn’t that right?」<br/>
「This is really pleasant weather~」<br/>
Just to make sure, let’s specify it one more time. The two were in the middle of freefalling without a parachute or lifeline.<br/>
「For now, should we try going under the sea of clouds?」<br/>
「Right. It looks like the weather art bad, but perhaps there wouldth be something that couldst make us understand what kind of world this place art. After all, there art nothing above the sky.」<br/>
Hajime and Tio plunged into the sea of clouds even while they were talking like that.<br/>
At that instant, they received a baptism of terrific air turbulence and random lightning. It seemed that this sea of clouds wasn’t merely thick clouds or rain clouds, but something that resembled a super vast cumulonimbus cloud. Seeing as how there wasn’t any sign of a vortex, it wasn’t any kind of typhoon. It was just a storm cloud with an abnormal range that silently covered the world as far as the eye could see.<br/>
The lightning is flying wildly about, along with thunderous sounds, attacked Hajime and Tio as though to remove the intruder.<br/>
Hajime’s body instantly emitted red sparks. The lightning that should strike Hajime’s body was directly streamed away as though it was sliding off the body. It then flew away in the direction of the beyond.<br/>
As for Tio, she seemed to be casually enduring the lightning by using dragon scale hardening. She also used regeneration magic to repair the holes that opened on her clothes with an unruffled air.<br/>
Only a few seconds past.<br/>
*bobat* Both of them came out at the bottom of the sea of clouds with some cloud parts trailing behind them.<br/>
Without delay, fierce wind and rain attacked the two mercilessly.<br/>
「Uwaa, this is just terrible.」<br/>
「What to say……art this world, ended already?」<br/>
Gravity control type multipurpose assault unit――Cross Velt. Hajime summoned eight of them to put up a cube-shaped barrier around him and Tio. They looked on from inside the cube at the rainwater trickling along the barrier’s surface and unconsciously leaked out their voices.<br/>
Their reaction was understandable. No matter how they looked at it, the heavy rain pouring down toward the world like a waterfall looked like muddy water. The rainwater that hit their skin dyed the spot pitch black.<br/>
Tio used wind magic to shake off the black rain, and while she was at it, she combined it with fire magic to warm her and Hajime’s wet body while drying out their clothes at high speed. She was doing that while expressing her impression toward this other world with a really astonished voice.<br/>
Her gaze was looking at her own arm that was wet with the black rain just now. Countless red specks were coming out from there. It seemed that the places that got touched by the black rain were getting inflammation.<br/>
It was a world with obviously harmful black rain pouring down.<br/>
Of course, perhaps this was a characteristic phenomenon of this region, but at the very least, it was obvious that the dark color of the ocean spreading below wasn’t caused just because the sunlight didn’t reach. This black rain was pouring down so much that it colored the sea black.<br/>
And then, if the sea, which was polluted to this degree, followed the sea current and flowed through the world……they naturally could imagine the hopelessness of this world.<br/>
Hajime took out his smartphone and made a drop of black rain to fall on the display. Right away, a ripple spread on the display. A loading screen appeared for a few seconds.<br/>
「Unknown composition, just as expected. It doesn’t match anything from the data of Tortus or Earth. Its effect on the human body is……oou, looks like Tio’s impression is seriously spot on. Look here. This rain has the effect to cause necrosis in the cell.」<br/>
「……Oh dear. However, no matter what kind of environment, what art called as living things wouldst find a way to adapt in the end and survive. There art still a possibility of organisms that managed to adapt in this place. Besides, perhaps even this black rain art limited to this area.」<br/>
「Well, you’re right. Anyway, for now, let’s return above. This rain doesn’t have much effect on us, and we can heal the effect right away, but even so, this kind of muddy, black world is depressing.」<br/>
「No doubt about that.」<br/>
Hajime and Tio took one last look at the raging black world before charging into the sea of clouds once more with the barrier still activated.<br/>
They went through the sea of clouds and returned once more to the clear azure sky.<br/>
「If someone met that spirited away phenomenon, then they will get thrown off into a world that is really hard to survive huh.」<br/>
「It looks like it. What wouldst we do Goshujin-sama? Art we going home?」<br/>
Tio asked without any doubt that they would be unable to return to Earth. With the "Compass of Guidance Crossing" and "Crystal Key", it was possible to return home to Earth no matter what kind of world they were in. That was the reason that the two weren’t flustered at all even when they were going to be swallowed by the white mist inside the cave.<br/>
Hajime turned his gaze at Tio’s question. He showed a thinking gesture「Hm~」and asked back in return.<br/>
「What do you want to do Tio?」<br/>
「……We should return. This adventure is not on the level of going to the mountain for a bit anymore. I wouldst consider looking around for a bit if this was a good world though……. Also thinking about the time until Yue and the others return home, even if we art going on an adventure, we should return once to take Yue and the others together too.」<br/>
Tio made a wry smile just for a moment before she advocated a cautious theory. Indeed, although they could return at any time, the scale of this situation was too big to be a little fun that was done while their family wasn’t at home. The state of this world was too turbulent.<br/>
It was really an opinion with the prudence that was just like Tio.<br/>
Hajime narrowed his eyes at Tio before he showed a bit of a thinking gesture once more. And then, perhaps he had finished scrutinizing Tio’s opinion because he smiled wryly while agreeing「I guess」, and then he activated his "Treasure Warehouse II" to take out the "Compass of Guidance Crossing".<br/>
Right after that,<br/>
「Hm? Hmm? ……Damn it. Now I’ve really done it, Tio.」<br/>
「Mu? What art the matter, Goshujin-sama.」<br/>
Hajime was scratching his head awkwardly which caused Tio to tilt her head in puzzlement. Her expression froze with a snap at Hajime’s next sentence.<br/>
「The compass, I forgot to bring it with me.」<br/>
Hajime was jovially saying「I’m beaten, I’m beaten」while laughing ‘tahahahaha’, with Tio staring open-mouthed in a daze and amazement at Hajime.<br/>
A beat, two beats. Finally, the meaning of Hajime’s words seemed to soak into Tio as her complexion changed, and she began to press questions in a fluster.<br/>
「Wha, wha wha, what do thy mean with forget!? It was inside the Treasure Warehouse wasn’t it!?」<br/>
「Haha~. I just recalled it only now, but just before this I lent it to Yue, but she hadn’t returned it to me. That’s really careless of me.」<br/>
「Tomfooleryy――!! Such an important thing art not something to be forgotten!」<br/>
「Oo, I got scolded by Tio……this is a really fresh experience.」<br/>
「Art this the time to say thattt――――!! What to do……, we couldst not go home.」<br/>
Hajime’s attitude that was too overflowing with irresponsibility caused Tio’s shoulders to drop dejectedly. She was in a state that she didn’t even realize that for the first time she had yelled angrily at Hajime.<br/>
「Well, don’t be that upset.」<br/>
「What? Goshujin-sama, thou art really composed. Art there any prospect of us going home?」<br/>
「We have no prospect to go home, but looking at it from the opposite side means that Yue is carrying the compass, so we don’t particularly need to get flustered, right? I am carrying the Crystal Key, but if she finds me using the compass, then it’s possible to search in reverse.」<br/>
「……I see. Now that thy said that, indeed there art no reason to lose composure. If Yue uses the compass to find us who didn’t return home, then we wouldst be able to return home at that point in time. Fumu, mine apologies Goshujin-sama. I was showing something unsightly.」<br/>
Being able to understand that their situation wasn’t particularly serious after getting told so, Tio cast down her eyes from the shame of her disordered state.<br/>
Tio, who averted her eyes, didn’t notice, but Hajime’s expression, who was looking at her embarrassed gesture, was extremely gentle. Different from the normal Hajime who was usually dealing with Tio in full S mode, his warm expression now was emitting a definite affection.<br/>
Everything was because he understood the reason why Tio unusually lost her composure like just now.<br/>
Tio wasn’t feeling uneasy at the possibility that they couldn’t return home itself. In front of her, there was a man who had obtained the means to cross over worlds with only his determination when at the start he didn’t have anything at all. Doubting that they couldn’t return home was instead nothing more than an insult to Hajime.<br/>
Therefore, the reason why Tio was flustered was something else. That reason was in the fact that she separated Hajime from Yue and the others through something that was caused by them doing something that she suggested. She had no doubt that they would be able to go home. But, the problem was the time. At how long Hajime would be separated from Yue and the others.<br/>
In short, her loss of composure at their inability to go home was the manifestation of her consideration toward Yue and co. Although her sturdiness was her strong point, she was someone who wouldn’t hesitate to turn her own body into a shield for her comrade’s sake. Her way of losing composure was really like herself.<br/>
「Well, under the cloud feels like the end of the century, but the sky is really not bad. Until it’s time, let’s go adventuring to see if this sea of clouds will end somewhere and if there is, we will look for land, Tio.」<br/>
「Right. Yes, yes-. Let’s do just that!」<br/>
The embarrassed Tio lively raised a happy voice after receiving that order to resume their adventure. There wasn’t even any need to mention her expression. It was truly a smile that would charm anyone, and that would make anyone who knew her to be amazed thinking「If she can always be like that, then there wouldn’t be anyone doubting her if she really is the princess of the dragon race or not」.<br/>
 <br/>
 <br/>
A while after they began their sky journey, currently, Tio had transformed into a black dragon, and Hajime was riding on her.<br/>
At first, Hajime was using his skyboard while Tio was also only using her wings from partial dragonification and used wind magic to fly in human form, but Hajime requested to her that he wanted to mount her.<br/>
Riding on a dragon’s back to fly in the sky far away――that yearning of every man had often been realized by Hajime, but he never got tired of it, and if there was a chance, then he would ask to ride Tio like this.<br/>
"It also hast been a while since I’ve flown with Goshujin-sama on mine back. There wasn’t that much chance since we returned to Earth."<br/>
「Yeah. What’s more, we were flying mainly at night whether on Tortus or Earth. It’s really has been a long time since we last flew in a sky this clear.」<br/>
"If thy wish it then we couldst fly anytime, correct? The sky of Earth art constrained, but if it’s now, then we couldst do anything using Goshuujin-sama’s artifacts, isn’t that right?"<br/>
「Yeah. I can just make an artifact for jamming and camouflage. Just spare me from having a dogfight with the ASDF.」(TN: Air Self-Defense Force)<br/>
Tio caught the wind and flew among the cloud chasms with a movement that was drawing an elegant curve. The milky road that was like flowing cotton candy was an amazingly superb view.<br/>
The sea of clouds wasn’t only shaped flatly. At some places, the clouds would make a gigantic mountain shape or chasm shape like where they were at right now. There were also clouds that were arch-shaped and also clouds that were shaped like surging tidal waves. It was a magnificent view that could be described as a continent that was made in the sky.<br/>
Hajime was sticking to Tio’s back using gravity control, so there wasn’t any concern that he would fall. The wind pressure and air were also controlled within one meter of his body using a dedicated earring artifact. And so, Tio was flying to her heart’s content without needing to give any consideration or restraint.<br/>
She broke out from the chasm with a steep climb and slipped through the gap between clouds lazily floating about while barrel rolling.<br/>
She passed under arching clouds and swiveled around a mountain of clouds as though she was dancing. She then went on a steep climb before letting her body swoop down in a free fall. And then, she unfolded her wings with a force that blew away the clouds in the surrounding and flew inside the tidal wave cloud like a surfer.<br/>
「Having fun?」<br/>
"Yes, this art really fun!"<br/>
In contrast with the fierce maneuvers, Hajime was asking questions in a calm voice. And the responding voice was an excited voice just as expected. And then, a single roar as though she was giving a service. While it was a powerful roar, the reverberation felt pleasant somehow. Hajime also raised a cheerful laugh at that.<br/>
But, it was at that time, as though in response to Tio’s howl, there was a faint sound reaching the two.<br/>
「O? Tio, just now……」<br/>
"It seemed, we hath discovered the first villager――no, the first living thing here. It’s truly auspicious that not every living thing here art exterminated."<br/>
Even in this world where black rain that caused necrosis on living cells was pouring down, it seemed there was still living things here as expected. Right now, the sound vibrating in their eardrum that was getting louder and louder was obviously coming from a living thing――in addition, it seemed to be a howl that came from a large type organism.<br/>
Hajime tapped on the black-scaled back, and Tio took a steep turn in complete agreement.<br/>
They passed through several cloud mountains and in the end, they circled around a conspicuously large spiraling cloud. Then, there they were able to catch sight of black spots in the sky that looked like dribbling ink.<br/>
"Hou……so there art mine fellow race even in this world."<br/>
「As expected this is a fantasy world huh. Well, we don’t know yet whether they are like your race that can turn into "human" or "dragon", or if they are just a variety of monster.」<br/>
The specks reflected on the azure sky were gradually growing bigger. The two who possessed eyesight that was incomparable with average people could clearly see the true form of those specks.<br/>
They were dragons. Not the snake type dragon of the east, but the western dragon. Their number was around ten. Their body was grey colored, and their body length was around two to three meters. Their bodies’ build looked bad. Compared to Tio’s build, they looked really frail. Their howl that they sometimes raised to call Tio sounded like a crying voice instead after the two saw their figures.<br/>
First things first, Tio tried talking to the small dragons that approached nearby in the blink of an eye in order to investigate their intelligence level.<br/>
"All of thee, art thee able to understand mine words? Couldst thee communicate using the mind?"<br/>
The response that came back was only *gyau gyau gyao gyao*, a crying voice of a beast. They were flying in circles around Tio who was hovering in midair as though they were fawning over her――<br/>
「「「「「……」」」」」<br/>
They took a second look at Hajime who was sitting on Tio’s back. They were definitely taking a second look.<br/>
Seeing that the grey dragons stopped crying and instead were fixedly staring at him, Hajime gazed back「Aa?」in suspicion.<br/>
Right after that,<br/>
「「「「「Gyuwa!?」」」」」<br/>
The grey dragons showed a reaction that looked like「We have seen something that mustn’t be seen!」before running away at full speed. There was even a dragon among them that was too panicked it lost speed and almost fell.<br/>
Their state was exactly like an unfortunate victim encountering a monster, or perhaps like a villager A who suddenly bumped into the demon king out of nowhere.<br/>
Like before, they only cried out like a beast without showing any state of using language, or even advanced intelligence. But seeing how they were running away with terrible desperation while looking behind them several times,<br/>
――Ruunnn, quickly runnn<br/>
――Someone-, someone helpppp!!<br/>
――Oh god! Oo, god in heaven, please grant us your salvation-<br/>
――There is no way, I’m going to die in this kind of placeeee-<br/>
It felt like those kinds of screams of the heart could be heard.<br/>
「…………Tio」<br/>
"Wha, what is it, Goshujin-sama."<br/>
Tio replied back to that quiet voice in a slight fluster. When she turned her head around and looked behind, she saw the figure of Hajime looking far away. A vague sorrow was drifting from his side profile.<br/>
「Am I, really that terrifying?」<br/>
"N, nooo, I think that art not really not the case……"<br/>
「But, no matter how I look at their reaction, it’s like they are a victim that encountered the devilish homicide in a horror movie. Even though I’m not emitting pressure or anything. Even though, I’m not doing anything.」<br/>
"Ma, mayhaps, they art not used to human? When they approached me because they thought of me as their fellow, they saw a creature that they hath not seen before and got surprised. Surely that art the case here."<br/>
「Are they running away that desperately in terror because they are surprised? ……Recently, I’ve been told that I was mellowing out, and I thought that I had adapted a bit to live on Earth but……」<br/>
"Goshujin-sama, mine motherly instinct art really tickled seeing thy rare disheartened figure, but for now, how about we try chasing after them? After all, they art the only living things in this world that we finally discovered."<br/>
「……You are right. Let’s do that.」<br/>
Tio was writhing lightly seeing Hajime who was somewhat dispirited.<br/>
If it was him when he was at Tortus, then something like this would cause a vein to twitch on his forehead before he shot them down *dopan-*, so him being disheartened like this showed that he was in the process of acclimating to life on Earth. That was what Tio thought, but this was really a rare sight, so she didn’t say anything instead.<br/>
In exchange, she urged Hajime to chase after the change in this world that they finally encountered so that it wouldn’t get away.<br/>
She flapped her wings once. Tio began to fly like she was gliding. The grey dragons that glanced back as though saying「They aren’t following us? Are we safe already?」saw the following Tio――or more accurately Hajime who was riding on her back, and their body twiiiitched and trembled.<br/>
Naturally, they began to escape with even more desperation than before.<br/>
「……」<br/>
"Aa~, Goshujin-sama? This art surely that. They don’t look like they hath intelligence on the level of humans, they art genuinely a beast. That’s why they art instinctually sensing Goshujin-sama’s strength――"<br/>
Tio followed up with a touching gesture. However, it was unclear whether her words reached or not. Hajime didn’t react at all while his somewhat dispirited expression was starting to change bit by bit.<br/>
The disheartened face turned into a fixed stare, and next, it changed into a small irritation. And then――<br/>
「Fine then. If they are asking for that kind of character from me, then, aah, that’s fine. I should answer their expectation. Ku-ku-ku-ku-」<br/>
"Go, Goshujin-sama, art making a sadist face like when he was dealing with me!? Run away! All of thee, quickly run awayyyyy-"<br/>
The demon king-sama stood up imposingly above Tio and widely spread his arms in a dramatic pose as though welcoming in the enemy. His lips split apart like a crescent moon while his eyes were blazing fiercely like a hunter cornering his prey!<br/>
Tio howled and urged the grey dragons to escape. The grey dragons that looked back simultaneously at that voice――saw it right away.<br/>
「Now, run, run, run! I’ll leisurely hunt you down and devour youuuuu-」<br/>
They saw the demon king who was bursting with crimson magic power while loudly yelling something like that which reverberated to the whole azure sky.<br/>
Of course, it went without saying that the body of the grey dragons twitcheeeeeeeeeed. It also went without saying that they were starting to run away with even more desperation than before. From behind them「HAAH――――HAHHAHHAHHAH!!」a loud laughter resounded. Something shining could be seen glittering around their eyes even though they were dragons――surely that was just an imagination.<br/>
 <br/>
 <br/>
Around thirty minutes after Hajime turned demon king. Hajime, who had just created one more piece of black history, was sitting on Tio’s back while grasping his knees. Tio, who was taking the stance of "Let’s just leave him alone for now", finally called out to Hajime.<br/>
"Goshujin-sama. Stop being down and look ahead."<br/>
「Just leave me alone Tio. I’m disgusted with my own foolish act and lack of growth. ……If I don’t reflect back on myself a bit, then I’ll turn completely into Endo.」<br/>
"If he heard that, then he wouldst get upset and indignated……no, mayhaps, he wouldst be happy because of his comrade increase? Well, rather than talking about that, come now, stop acting like that and raise thy head. It was worth it to chase after those dragons with some distance in between. I believe this art a sight that wouldst make thy heart greatly throb though?"<br/>
「Dismissing my concern like that……well, certainly the matter of Endo doesn’t matter but……. And, what are you saying about the sight――」<br/>
Hajime stopped hugging his knees while casually saying something cruel about a certain friend with a thin presence and lifted his gaze. And then, he lost his words while unconsciously rising a voice of admiration「Ooo」.<br/>
In the middle of the chase, the two felt that it was futile chasing after the grey dragons and took some distance from them while following behind without the dragons noticing. And now, it seemed that they had reached the place where the dragons were dwelling.<br/>
「Is this a real Lap○ta huh?」<br/>
"Aah, that masterpiece……indeed, this resembles that. Though, as for me, this reminds me of the Holy Precincts."<br/>
The sea of clouds continued without end since the place they appeared at in the beginning up till now. There was only the sea of clouds as far as their eye could see. It was possible that perhaps this sea of clouds was covering the whole world. In that case, because the surface was ravaged by the black rain that was bringing fatality to living things, then where would the dragons rest their wings――the answer to that question was this.<br/>
――An island floating in the sky.<br/>
Yes, it was a piece of land that was floating above the sea of clouds without anything supporting it from below. It was as though a piece of land had been reeled up as it was. Below it was the exposed earth and stones, above there was the verdant green ground, and there was even a forest covering the center of the floating island with tall trees. Its size was around five or six Tokyo Domes.<br/>
「I thought that this was a fantasy world by the time there were dragons, but with this, it feels even more like it.」<br/>
"Before, there was no time to observe the floating island of the Holy Precincts thoroughly. I am feeling a bit thrilled. Goshujin-sama, the dragons before art likely to be here too, so it’s better to land on the edge as to not surprise them, correct?"<br/>
「Yeah, do that. I’ll use "Presence Isolation" in advance.」<br/>
The more Tio approached, the more a commotion happened in the forest at the center. The trees were unnaturally shaking slightly; however, right after that, the forest was filled with peacefulness. Surely the dragons were hiding there.<br/>
Tio landed on the edge of the floating island while feeling their presence. She landed gently with a softness that didn’t fit her large body. Hajime jumped down from Tio’s back and stepped on the lush ground with his own feet.<br/>
Right after that, Tio dispelled her dragon transformation and stood beside Hajime. *rustle*, a sign of agitation was spreading from the forest.<br/>
「It looks like normal weeds from the appearance. The composition of the soil……it seems similar with Earth and Tortus but……hm?」<br/>
Hajime crouched and took a grass within his hand, and he then analyzed the soil composition with "Mineral Appraisal". And then, 「Oh?」 he blinked as though he noticed something.<br/>
「What art the matter? Art there some kind of mysterious composition mixed in it?」<br/>
「Rather than calling it a mysterious composition……something that is really similar with a composition I’m really familiar with is mixed in. What’s more, it’s scattered all over in a wide scope like a fertilizer.」<br/>
「Familiar composition? From thy speech, is it something from Tortus?」<br/>
「Yeah. They are small granulated minerals that are even smaller than sand. ――"Converging Transmutation"」<br/>
Thinking that it was faster to see directly, he made his palm face up. Right after that, Hajime was activating a transmutation master’s secret art of transmuting without the hand directly touching the material to converge the mineral in the surrounding.<br/>
Sparkling sands were bursting out from Hajime’s surrounding. They were like large flowing rivers of the cosmos, swirling like sparkling stars with Hajime as the center where they were gradually converging above his palm.<br/>
With an emission of crimson sparks, the item that was finally created by the compression transmutation was a fragment of shining azure mineral.<br/>
「This art……it looks like god crystal.」<br/>
「Yeah. Though it’s different in the finer aspects. It seems that the aspect where it takes in magic power and condenses it to manifest liquid is the same though.」<br/>
To be more specific, it couldn’t retain magic power as much as a god crystal, and on top of that, it also didn’t have the power to create god water that possessed the recovery effect, which wouldn’t be an exaggeration to be called as regeneration. However, its ability to take in magic power into itself and then create a liquid with abundant nourishment, and then its circulation rate of going through those sequences were far faster and more efficient to the degree that couldn’t be compared to the god crystal’s production of god water.<br/>
Hajime acquired that knowledge from the analysis of his smartphone that was equipped with the advanced function of analyzing using "Mineral Appraisal", Creation Magic, and Metamorphosis Magic. Tio, who received Hajime’s explanation, said「I see」in understanding and then looked around.<br/>
「So that’s how a land floating in the sky couldst be this verdant. The reason art because it hath that god crystal look alike.」<br/>
「Looks like it. Although, that’s not the reason why this land is floating though……」<br/>
Hajime stood up and turned his gaze to the center of the floating island. He intended to go investigate there. Tio also nodded and was about to walk, but it was at that time,<br/>
「Mu? So they art coming out by their own initiative.」<br/>
One dragon suddenly showed its face from behind a tree. *jii~* It was staring at Tio.<br/>
Hajime and Tio looked at each other. For now, they would try watching in silence. Hajime was using "Presence Isolation" at full power while also forming a simple barrier using a pencil-sized Cross Velt. It wasn’t an artifact for defense, but a barrier artifact that used space magic to bend the light for optical camouflage. It wasn’t that powerful, but it more or less also possessed space isolation effect, so it blocked the body odor from detection.<br/>
The small grey dragon was looking *jii~* at Tio for a while, but seeing that Tio wasn’t moving while looking back at it with a calm expression, it seemed the dragon let its guard down just a little because it came out with unsure steps from the forest.<br/>
Behind that dragon, 「Oi, is it really okay?」「Stop I told you! You are going to die!」the other dragons timidly showed their face from behind the trees as though to say that.<br/>
「It looks like they art calming down a bit there~」<br/>
The figure of those dragons that could be said to be charming in a sense caused Tio to loosen up her face. Perhaps Tio’s atmosphere that was softening further encouraged it, and the dragon in the lead was advancing a bit and stopped, then it advanced a bit and stopped again. It was repeating that action while approaching Tio bit by bit.<br/>
Before long, the dragon that had arrived near Tio brought its snout closer to Tio, and it sniffed her smell *sniff sniff*. And then, it nervously retracted back its neck and tilted its head before it brought its nose closer again and sniffed her scent *sniff sniff* again.<br/>
「Hmm. It appears they art confused, whether I am a dragon or a human. In that case……it’s great isn’t it, Goshujin-sama. It appears Goshujin-sama art not especially hated; these children seem to fear "human" itself.」<br/>
"I see. In other words, that means humans, or at the very least "humanoid" beings, are existing in this world."<br/>
Hajime replied using "Telepathy" just in case so the dragon wouldn’t get spooked. While the two were doing that, the other dragons also seemed to lose to their curiosity toward this mysterious existence who smelled like their race even though she was human. They were coming out of the forest even while looking timid with unsure steps.<br/>
Tio was surrounded by dragons in the blink of an eye. She slowly reached out her hand toward one of the dragons that was bringing its snout closer. The dragon twitched and drew back, but when it saw Tio waiting silently with her hand still reached out, it approached back slowly.<br/>
Finally, Tio’s hand touched the dragon’s snout. And then, when Tio caressed it, the dragon blinked in surprise before it started to narrow its eyes pleasantly. Its shrill but low purr *kururururu-* seemed to show its fawning act.<br/>
Behind Tio, another dragon was pressing its snout as though to appeal ‘me too’. Just when she thought that was it, the other dragons also pushed their snouts forward from the left and right too.<br/>
「Oi oi, all of thee. For the dragon race of all things to be spoiled children like this, every single one of thou? What troubling children.」<br/>
Tio chuckled while saying that. Although, even though she was saying that, the emotion dwelling in her eyes was an unconcealed kindness. She gently caressed them in turn with smiling eyes and loosened cheeks, looking truly like a mother.<br/>
Hajime also looked fondly at the figure of Tio surrounded by dragons while gently spoiling them. Even though normally she was very much a pervert, her true nature was a noble person that was overflowing with prudence, kindness, and pride. That was exactly the charm of this woman, Tio Claus.<br/>
「Mu? I vaguely feel a passionate gaze……now-now, Goshujin-sama. Art thou envious that I am paying attention only to these children?」<br/>
While smiling mischievously, Tio accurately threw her gaze at Hajime who was hiding behind the barrier of optical camouflage.<br/>
It was a fact that Hajime was captivated, so he smiled wryly while replying「Perhaps」. After getting that unexpectedly positive reply, Tio’s cheeks blushed faintly. It seemed she was a bit happy.<br/>
To divert the attention from her shyness, she opened her mouth with a bit of rapid talk.<br/>
「Goshujin-sama. If it’s now, these children’s wariness art lessened considerably, how about giving a try to pat them?」<br/>
"I guess. There won’t be many chances of something like this."<br/>
Hajime manipulated the pencil Cross Velt and deployed the optical camouflage as close as possible on his body. He was also in the middle of activating Presence Isolation in full force, so he should be able to pat the dragon if he reached his hand from a blind spot.<br/>
Hajime slowly approached a dragon. It was half closing its eyes from Tio’s caressing, so it shouldn’t notice anything even if he touched it a bit.<br/>
But, it seemed that wild instinct wasn’t that naïve.<br/>
「!?」<br/>
The dragon that Hajime approached suddenly leapt back from that spot. Furthermore, that jump happened so deftly and vigorously that for a moment there it felt like there would be a sound *hyuba-*.<br/>
‘Am I noticed?’ Hajime stared fixedly, but the dragon tilted its head「kuruu?」while looking around. It seemed it didn’t notice Hajime, but it only acted instinctually.<br/>
Hajime tried taking a step forward. The dragon took a step back. Hajime tried taking two steps forward. The dragon took two steps back. Hajime tried to circle behind it. The dragon circled with a fixed distance preserved in between. It was as though there was an unseen wall between Hajime and the dragon as the two sides were turning in circles without any change of distance between them.<br/>
It seemed that the dragon didn’t understand why it was acting like this. It frequently tilted its head.<br/>
「Ma, mayhaps it understands instinctually that there art something it hates there?」<br/>
Tio muttered such a thing, perhaps from sensing how Hajime’s eyes were gradually turning scornful.<br/>
Hajime tried approaching the other dragons. The other dragons also took a distance with natural movement. No matter where Hajime tried to go, the dragons would distance themselves from Hajime as though they were magnets of opposite poles. There was no doubt that they didn’t notice Hajime’s existence. In other words, they were avoiding him on a subconscious level.<br/>
Hajime was hurt for a tiny bit. He was looking at the day after tomorrow with a faraway look.<br/>
But, at that time, perhaps it was just a coincidence, but one dragon clawed on the ground with its hind leg. The soil that was hurled from that went splat on Hajime.<br/>
That action was as though like what a cat or a dog would do to filth……<br/>
「……Go, Goshujin-sama?」<br/>
「……」<br/>
Hajime didn’t reply. He merely grinned.<br/>
Crimson magic power suddenly sparked. The dragons were still busy fawning on Tio. They didn’t notice how they had stepped on a landmine.<br/>
Hajime slowly walked while still having the barrier and Presence Isolation activated and took a position at the center of the dragons by skillfully manipulating the distance.<br/>
There, the dragons finally noticed the strange air and they looked around restlessly.<br/>
And then, they turned their gazes’ at the area centered around them, which, for some reason, was empty without anyone being there.<br/>
――Stand B~y! Stand B~~y!!<br/>
――Now, everyone, are you all finished with your preparations?<br/>
――It’s starting you know?<br/>
――Pe~~ek, aa~~~~~~~~~……demon king!<br/>
The barrier vanished, and the Presence Isolation was dispelled.<br/>
What appeared was a bursting crimson magic power with the demon king-sama grinning wideeeeely at the center.<br/>
The result went without saying.<br/>
「「「「「PIGYAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAH!!!」」」」」<br/>
The dragons’ screams that were filled with fright resounded through the clear blue sky.<br/>
