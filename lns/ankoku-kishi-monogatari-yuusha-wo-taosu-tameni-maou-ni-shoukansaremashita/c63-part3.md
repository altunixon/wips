Chapter 63.3 : A Happy Reunion<br/>
Note : HEAL!!!<br/>
===<br/>
「Nevertheless, it seems that General Clasus wants to celebrate our success so let’s chill out for the time being before moving to our next plan.」<br/>
I spoke with a slightly indignant voice.<br/>
It seems that General Clasus wants to celebrate the matter of us freeing the people that were imprisoned in the labyrinth.<br/>
「Celebration huh, sounds good. Having to eat the poor meals in the labyrinth made me miss the delicious meal out here.」<br/>
Nao spoke as a thread of drool hung down from her mouth.<br/>
「You bet!! Now it’s time to take a breather after being locked down in that place for a long time!」<br/>
Rino spoke with a strong tone.<br/>
「Yeah. We need to take a breather.」<br/>
Reiji approved Nao’s suggestion too. Since many beauties would be coming to the celebration, his smiling face must be a result of imagining those scenes.<br/>
「Celebration huh… Kuroki, who contributed the most, isn’t even here though…」<br/>
Shirone spoke with a gloomy voice.<br/>
Surely, the one who’d contributed the most this time around was him. And yet, that very same person wasn’t even here to celebrate with us.<br/>
「Yeah. The one who really saved the people in the labyrinth is him, not me or Reiji. We really have to praise him.」<br/>
I spoke while giving a sidelong glance towards Reiji.<br/>
Reiji was clearly displeased upon hearing that. But, he couldn’t talk back and refute it either since he knew very well that we would’ve literally been doomed if it weren’t for Kuroki’s backup.<br/>
My mood suddenly improved a lot upon seeing Reiji’s vexed face.<br/>
I had yet to thank Kuroki for his help back in the Rox kingdom too. I felt the goodwill behind his actions that saved my life. I guess I’m with Shirone in regards to wanting to save him too. Though Reiji and Sahoko might be against it, I think we should make him our comrade.<br/>
I wonder where he is and what he’s doing right now…<br/>
===<br/>
◆Dragon Priestess; Regena<br/>
「Well then, please take care of us, Regena-san.」<br/>
Kaya-sama spoke to me.<br/>
「Uhm, are you sure about this?」<br/>
「Don’t worry, Tormalkis will help you in that regard.」<br/>
「Please take care of me, Regena-sama.」<br/>
The plump man besides her cupped his hands while bowing to me.<br/>
The mansion that we were using was previously his properly. But then, he’d fallen under suspicion of tricking the Hero since his wife, Atlan, whose whereabouts were currently unknown, was an Evil God.<br/>
But aside from that, he was only a normal human who’d goten tricked by the Evil God. It seems that even he didn’t know of Atlan’s whereabouts.<br/>
But, Kaya-sama wasn’t so kind as to let him off scot-free. She’d seized his assets and turned them into Kyouka-sama’s property.<br/>
The mansion, which had become Kyouka-sama’s property as well, was currently being used as the Midou company’s Ariadya branch. And just a moment ago, Kaya-sama had made a request for me to take care of Midou company’s Ariadya branch.<br/>
「In addition, I’ll invite the people from Holy Republic Lenaria. You can rest assured with the girl who I trained personally, Regena-san.」<br/>
Despite her words, I shook my head to show my refusal.<br/>
「Uhm… I think it’s impossible for someone like me to handle a trading company!!」<br/>
And why me of all people? There should be many more competent people that would be better for this position.<br/>
「It’s okay, Regena-san. You’re someone who got Kuroki-san’s recognition after all. That’s why I feel that there’s no worries in entrusting this branch to you.」<br/>
Kyouka-sama smiled as she said so.<br/>
For some reason, Kyouka-sama held my master(husband) in high regard. I feel like it’s a good thing to have more people that had a high evaluation of my master(husband). And her words had hit my sore spot.<br/>
How could I refuse when she’d brought up my master’s(husband) name?<br/>
「You’re qualified for this matter, Regena-san. I mean, you can use the Lizardmans for the transportation of goods via Quiche river. That will give you an upper hand against the other merchants who can’t do the same thing. You’ll gain enormous profits from that for sure.」<br/>
It seems that Kaya-sama’s expectations for me were completely different from Kyouka-sama.<br/>
Their gazes were fixed on me.<br/>
If possible, I wanted to escape from this place.<br/>
「Shall we test her idea… master(husband).」<br/>
My master’s(husband) appeared in my mind as I looked up to the sky.<br/>
===<br/>
◆Dark Knight; Kuroki<br/>
The place I reunited with Kuna was close to the center of the mountain range.<br/>
「KUROKI!!」<br/>
Kuna quickly embraced me as soon as she saw my figure and looked up at me with moist eyes.<br/>
After not seeing her for a few days, I noticed that Kuna had become even more beautiful than before. And I was currently embracing such a beauty.<br/>
It was something that had never happened to me back in my original world.<br/>
I was almost brought to tears upon recalling those painful memories.<br/>
YOU DID IT, ME!!<br/>
「Yup… sorry, Kuna. You must’ve been lonely when I wasn’t there with you… You too, Glorious.」<br/>
I gently caressed Glorious’ head.<br/>
Glorious let out a spoiled growl when I caressed her head.<br/>
「I missed you so much… Kuroki. Let’s go back together…」<br/>
I shook my head in response.<br/>
「Kuna, how about we take this chance to enjoy the Republic of Ariadya?」<br/>
「Republic Ariadya?」<br/>
Kuna tilted her head, asking with a puzzled look on her face.<br/>
「Yeah, I’ll take you along for a date around the Republic of Ariadya.」<br/>
I’d done my research for dating spots within the Republic of Ariadya along with Rena. Plus, we could also go see the opera now.<br/>
「Kuna will follow you wherever you are, Kuroki.」<br/>
Kuna smiled sweetly at me.<br/>
That smile was truly an angelic smile. I could finish three bowls of rice with this smile as a side dish. Naturally, a big bowl of rice.<br/>
「Nyufufufufu.」<br/>
I ended up letting out a strange laugh. As if that wasn’t enough, it was even accompanied with drool.<br/>
「Is something the matter, Kuroki?」<br/>
Kuna asked with a curious look on her face.<br/>
「No, it’s nothing. Shall we go then?」<br/>
I got a grip on myself and wiped the drool at the edge of my mouth.<br/>
Thus we proceeded to fly towards the Republic of Ariadya on Glorious’ back.<br/>
The sun had set already by the time we realized. We were currently bathed under the silvery moonlight that illuminated the night sky. Different from the sun, the moonlight was a gentle light that caressed everyone equally.<br/>
And we continued to ride on Glorious’ back, bathing under the silvery moonlight, as we headed towards the Republic of Ariadya.<br/>
