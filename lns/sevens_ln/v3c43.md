Chapter 43 – Holiday at Centralle<br/>
<br/>
In Centralle’s weapon shop.<br/>
All the sabers that are showed to me by the shopkeeper are intended for battle with little decoration. I thought there would be many sabers with a lot of decoration for the sake of viewing, but this is a nice surprise.<br/>
「There are a lot of sabers with unrefined design, rather I should say that they’re intended for battle.」<br/>
When I said that, the shopkeeper explained to me.<br/>
「There are also a lot of artisans that hate decorations or have a strong obsession that they can only make things like this. Well, I don’t stock up a lot of this thing so there is no problem. With the trend right now, rather than this, the one put up on the wall over there is more popular.」<br/>
A saber was decorating the wall. It was inlaid with gold, silver, and gems as decoration. It’s not like it’s unusable for real battle, but that kind of thing made me hesitate to use it as a disposable item.<br/>
It looked like it’s strongly leaning to being a work of art.<br/>
「……It’ll be a waste to swing it around in real battle.」<br/>
「After all you won’t expect battle to happen in Centralle. People with jobs as knights, soldiers, or adventurers and mercenaries will prefer firmer weapons rather than a saber.」<br/>
Well, I guess so. Until now I never saw any adventurer who is uses a saber.<br/>
I took one saber.<br/>
「Then, can I meet with the blacksmith who created this?」<br/>
By doing that I’ll be able to ask the blacksmith to create something that is more to my preference, but then the shopkeeper shook his head. Is it no good just as expected?<br/>
「I bought the merchandise from the north, so I didn’t really know who made them. Instead, if it’s the blacksmiths in Centralle then I can introduce you to them.」<br/>
It can’t be helped. For now I’ll choose one that seems good and purchase it. From here, if I’m thinking to use one saber for a long time, then perhaps custom-made will be the best.<br/>
Even if right now is impossible, someday I’ll ask a blacksmith I can trust to make it.<br/>
The saber I purchased is made solidly for real battle. It doesn’t look like I’ll need to buy a replacement for it for a while.<br/>
.<br/>
I who left my luggage in the inn went out with a single saber hanging on my waist.<br/>
Novem, Aria-san, and also Sophia-san were going out for shopping. I’m walking alone through Centralle’s street.<br/>
But──<br/>
「……I’ve nothing to do.」<br/>
When I said that, the Sixth raised his voice happily.<br/>
"Lyle, the time has come for even you to experience having fun!"<br/>
I became curious at the having fun that the Sixth said and tightly grabbed the Jewel, asking him to continue. For some reason the Fifth and the Seventh are making displeased voices inside the Jewel.<br/>
"It makes me uneasy when you’re the one saying that."<br/>
"I think it’s wrong getting taught about having fun by someone who had fun too much."<br/>
The Sixth made a forced cough, and then he continued from there.<br/>
"Even Lyle needs a hobby. It’s important to find something that you’re interested in. And so, Lyle……walk straight through this street, and then turn right."<br/>
When I advanced to the place that the Sixth instructed me to, I came out in a street that was obviously indecent. There is a noisy establishment on such street.<br/>
A staff member with a scary face wearing a black suit was standing in front of the establishment with his back straight. However, the Sixth seemed to have business with this place.<br/>
"Yosh, get inside!"<br/>
The Fourth is exasperated.<br/>
"Gambling? That’s exasperating. This kind of place is made so that the management will win. It’s already pointless from the start."<br/>
The Third’s opinion is a bit different.<br/>
"It’s fine if it’s just testing your luck moderately, as long as you don’t ruin yourself."<br/>
Like that I stepped inside the casino but──<br/>
First is a card game.<br/>
"Trump is the staple game."<br/>
The Sixth said that and checked my hand. It seems to be a game that is played with the other customers. The opinion of the ancestors is split here.<br/>
"I’ve got a bad feeling. You better give up this round!"<br/>
"But his hand’s lineup isn’t so bad isn’t it? Let’s exchange the card and watch the situation for now. Exchange three of them at least."<br/>
"Isn’t that most of them? Playing safely here──"<br/>
"Anything is fine, let’s just do it quickly."<br/>
"Go! You should make the bet here Lyle!"<br/>
"No, this is where you should be firm and steady!"<br/>
What are they telling me to do? I think for a while, then I tried exchanging two of my cards. It became two pairs so I tried making a bet, but the other customer has a better combination and I lost.<br/>
The Second spoke triumphantly.<br/>
"That’s why I told you guys. It’s better to give up!"<br/>
The other ancestors seemed to be irritated at the smug Second. And so the game continued as it is. Sometimes I won, but a lot of the times I lost. In the end several pieces of silver coins vanished in the blink of an eye. There is only one coin remaining in my hand.<br/>
Or rather…….<br/>
「Why are we buying coins in a casino? It will be easier to do it with real coins.」<br/>
The Fourth spoke philosophically in response.<br/>
"Well, the world is a complex place. So, are you finished with this?"<br/>
The Sixth yelled.<br/>
"Not yet! There are still a lot of ways to have fun! Lyle, next is……that!"<br/>
It seems to be a game of throwing a small ball into a rotating circle and we have to guess where the ball will stop.<br/>
Honestly, I’m not really interested but I tried it out.<br/>
The result──<br/>
"……Isn’t Lyle, strong?"<br/>
It’s just as the Second said, I continued to win. The Third is also surprised.<br/>
"He’s too strong. Or rather, it’s scary that he’s this strong. The surroundings are also shocked."<br/>
The other customers and staff are also shocked seeing me continue to win.<br/>
The coins in my possession have grown until double my original amount. If I exchanged it into money it felt like I can get a gold coin.<br/>
The Sixth is excited. He is wondering which number to gamble next.<br/>
Looks like he is looking forward to it.<br/>
"Yosh, Lyle, next where should──"<br/>
──Or rather, I have enough.<br/>
「I’ll try another game.」<br/>
"Oi. ……Oi! You, you have won this much, and yet you!"<br/>
The Sixth complained to me, but I took my coins and played another game. After that, I tried various things but…….<br/>
When I got out of the casino, I ended up with one silver coin more than the amount that I paid at the beginning.<br/>
I won, lost, won, lost……at the end it’s a plus, but to only get one silver coin after spending that much time……was it worthwhile? The earning is better than working normally but, it really doesn’t suit me.<br/>
「……Let’s go back.」<br/>
A silver coin. Let’s use it to eat with everyone. It seems that I’m not suited with casinos.<br/>
.<br/>
──Aria was shopping at Centralle with Novem and Sophia.<br/>
They were mainly purchasing clothes, and then things like consumable goods. As to be expected from Centralle, the capital of Bahnseim, the variety of goods was abundant.<br/>
Aria who was holding her baggage with both hands was in a good mood after shopping.<br/>
「How nice~, it’s great that there are a lot of things available in Centralle. The tools I’m using in work are also damaged so I needed to buy new ones as replacement.」<br/>
Sophia was also the same.<br/>
「We’re buying a bit too many clothes though.」<br/>
Novem looked at the two and chuckled.<br/>
「They’re necessary after all. But, we might need to economize a bit at Arumsaas.」<br/>
Aria was a bit surprised hearing that.<br/>
「Eh!? We bought too much?」<br/>
Aria and the two girls, or rather Lyle’s party wasn’t troubled with money right now. However, even that much money would be used up quickly by their livelihood as adventurers.<br/>
Novem shook her head.<br/>
「No, just this much isn’t any trouble at all. But, we’ll be heading to Arumsaas after this. If we want to learn something there, we will need money.」<br/>
Sophia recalled about Arumsaas and spoke.<br/>
「In Arumsaas we can learn any kind of knowledge or skill if we pay money. It’s called the academy city, is it an educational institution? I heard there is also a school there but, I also heard that it’s a city that takes money to live there.」<br/>
Aria pondered a bit.<br/>
「Putting aside knowledge, skill is it……should I think that we can learn it as long as we can pay the money? Besides, is a skill something that can be learned that easily?」<br/>
Novem slightly lifted her face and explained to the two.<br/>
「Depending on the situation it might take years. If it’s not something difficult then it will take several weeks I believe. But, there is no problem even if we don’t force ourselves to learn. After all we can also invite adventurers with the necessary skills into our party.」<br/>
A new comrade. Lyle’s party was categorized as a party with few members as adventurers. Due to that they could move easily, but it could also be said that the burden on each of them was big.<br/>
Thinking of that, it was only natural to increase the number of party members and decrease the burden to each member. It wasn’t like they were aiming to be a party of a small elite force.<br/>
(Well, we’ll just normally add more party members then. Hm?)<br/>
There Aria noticed.<br/>
「Come to think of it, why didn’t Novem invite Rondo-san’s group? I heard that Lyle refused their invitation but, they are good people. Besides, Rachel-san also invited you right?」<br/>
Novem made a slightly complicated expression when Aria asked the reason why they didn’t make Rondo’s party their comrade.<br/>
「Certainly, Rachel-san had invited me several times. But, we’re a party with Lyle-sama as the leader. While Rondo-san is the leader over there……this might sound horrible but, there is no need for two leaders. After all in that case it will have to be decided who is above who.」<br/>
In case they joined with each other, which one would have the right to decide? And then their own rule that they had followed until now would have to be changed greatly. If they joined both parties just because they got along with each other, it would become a big problem. That was Novem’s explanation.<br/>
「Besides, I wanted Lyle-sama’s friend to stay as his friend.」<br/>
Sophia looked understanding.<br/>
「They won’t be able to keep the friendship if it goes poorly after all. Certainly, perhaps it can be said that it’s better to not combine the parties.」<br/>
Aria didn’t understand what they meant, but she was convinced because the two of them were saying that.<br/>
(Is it something like that? It feels like it could go well if it’s with those three though.)<br/>
「Then, how many people are we going to invite into the party at Arumsaas?」<br/>
Novem was about to answer Aria’s question, but another person’s voice interrupted her.<br/>
「You, could it be you are Lockwarde?」<br/>
There two girls were standing. They were wearing lovely and expensive looking clothes, They looked at Aria and laughed scornfully.<br/>
(These girls)<br/>
Aria scowled. The reason was because these girls were her friends when she was living in Centralle. Although they became estranged when the Lockwarde House declined.<br/>
Those two looked at Aria from the top of her head until the tips of her toes and laughed.<br/>
「What’s with that getup? Aren’t you embarrassed dressing like a commoner?」<br/>
「Don’t be stupid. She is already a commoner. The Lockwarde House has been abolished. They were chased out from Centralle and their peerage stripped off. ……And, why are you in Centralle now?」<br/>
Sophia whispered into Aria’s ear.<br/>
「Are they your acquaintances?」<br/>
Aria answered with a displeased look.<br/>
「They’re daughters of capital nobles in Centralle. I don’t want to get involved with them so let’s go.」<br/>
Although she called them friends, they were only getting along because of the relationship between their houses. That was why, they stopped being her friend when her house declined. And in the first place they weren’t even the type of people that she liked.<br/>
Furthermore, their houses framed the Lockwarde House to save their own hide. They were capital nobles that committed the same crimes as the Lockwarde House, but they pushed all the blame to Aria’s family and acted like they hadn’t done anything.<br/>
Novem also guessed it and walked away from there, but the girls seemed to think that their reactions were irritating.<br/>
「Wait. You were told to leave Centralle right? I’ll report that you’re here right now.」<br/>
The girl grabbed Aria’s shoulder and picked a quarrel. Aria forcefully brushed off her hand and glared.<br/>
「There is no problem if I’m only staying here for a short time. It’s not like it concerns you two anyway.」<br/>
The two laughed scornfully at Aria’s challenging attitude.<br/>
「You who aren’t even a noble can’t possibly know even a slightest part of our feeling. In that case, we’ll call for people right away to deal with you.」<br/>
Aria was about to open her mouth, but Novem took a step forward.<br/>
「What do you want?」<br/>
「My apologies. My name is Novem Forxuz. I too am originally a noble. And I’m also Aria-san’s friend. I cannot overlook this.」<br/>
Then one of the girls glared at Novem, but the other girl went pale hearing Novem’s surname.<br/>
「Forxuz, you said……let’s go」<br/>
「What! Why do we have to run away from them huh!?」<br/>
One girl forcefully pulled the other girl and the two of them left Aria and the others.<br/>
Sophia saw that and looked astonished.<br/>
「Say, is that normal in Cetralle? No matter what that’s just……」<br/>
Aria understood what Sophia wanted to say. No matter what those girls were too haughty. But, in a large country that was the great Bahnseim, those kinds of people numbered a lot among the nobles.<br/>
Rather, those girls were still at a cute level.<br/>
「Something like that is still cute. The terrible kind will be even more terrible……even so, Novem’s family name is really effective. As expected, is it because your house is a feudal lord noble?」<br/>
Novem was seriously watching the two girls leaving. And then, she replied to Aria.<br/>
「As expected my family isn’t that famous. But we’re connected to the Walt House, so perhaps they’re wary of that.」<br/>
The three headed back to their inn after that to put down their luggage──<br/>
.<br/>
「……Haa, there is still time.」<br/>
Because Novem and the others are shopping, I’m wander aimlessly alone.<br/>
Even the casino didn’t feel that interesting to me. The having fun that the Sixth suggested also became things like alcohol or woman so the other ancestors opposed him.<br/>
There is no problem with alcohol, but it’s still too early right now to drink. How can I meet Novem and the others in a drunk state? The Fourth strongly opposed it.<br/>
It’s also the same regarding playing around with woman. For this one it was the Fifth who strongly opposed it. The Second was also of the same opinion.<br/>
But, the Third was──<br/>
"Shouldn’t Lyle get a bit more familiar with woman? I’m in agreement with that idea."<br/>
The Sixth recovered his vitality after obtaining a supporter for his idea.<br/>
"Exactly! Lyle, experience is the most important thing. Have fun for a bit before meeting the girls."<br/>
The Seventh is silent. Or rather, it made me curious what is the Seventh thinking silently like that.<br/>
「Even if you told me that, having fun like that when the sun is still high like this is just……」<br/>
While I’m walking like that, I smell a really disgusting scent. It’s a smell that felt rotten. I frowned, but the people walking around me don’t seem bothered.<br/>
While I’m walking the street like that, a shop entered my eyes.<br/>
Tools are placed at the shopfront. Looking at that it seems that it’s a shop for "fishing gear".<br/>
The Second talked to me seeing that.<br/>
"Then, I’ll teach you fishing."<br/>
The Second will teach me fishing that the First didn’t manage to teach to me. I tightly gripped the Jewel and entered the shop. I purchased a set of fishing gear.<br/>
.<br/>
「Uwaa……it’s dirty.」<br/>
It seems the true identity of the disgusting smell is the river. Trash is flowing following the river’s flow. A great amount of trash that got stuck at both sides of the river and unknown things are floating in the water.<br/>
When I thought that I’ll make my fishing debut in this kind of place, it made me feel unpleasant.<br/>
The Second is also troubled.<br/>
"This is terrible. Is there any fish here?"<br/>
When I looked around, I can see several people here and there who are also fishing. It also will be a waste if I bought this fishing gear and don’t use them, so I prepared like the Second taught me and dangled the fishing line.<br/>
「……No fish is coming.」<br/>
The Third opened his mouth in surprise.<br/>
"No, you won’t catch anything right after you started!"<br/>
I sat down at a random spot and then watched the river in a daze. Looking closer, the river’s color looked really similar to the inside of a slime’s body. It’s a muddy green color, or perhaps a yellow-green color with viscous quality. Don’t the people living in Centralle feel anything looking at this river?<br/>
The Fourth recalled the past in nostalgia.<br/>
"Come to think of it, I played in the river in the past. Though as expected you will get sick if you enter inside this river."<br/>
The Third also felt nostalgic.<br/>
"I remember the Fourth was really happy when we went out to play in the water. Well, I was also the same. I often played with Nii-san. Or rather, the fish caught in this river……will it be edible?"<br/>
The Seventh rejected that in his worry for me.<br/>
"There is no way Lyle can eat a fish that is living inside water this dirty. Lyle, absolutely don’t eat any fish here. Remember that, absolutely don’t!"<br/>
Even without him pushing me like that, I only want to experience fishing and don’t think of eating anything that I catch. The Second talked about the past.<br/>
"In the countryside, the river’s water is clean, there will be a lot of fish too. Depending on the type of fish, you will be able to grill and eat the fish right away or you’ll have to bring it home to take out the mud before grilling it……I don’t think fish that is living in this river will be edible even if you drain out the mud from it."<br/>
The Fifth spoke with a slightly envious tone.<br/>
"I once played in the water in the mansion. But, I never went fishing."<br/>
The Sixth is different.<br/>
"I fished when I went out. At that time I would bring back the fish and made a woman……it’s nothing."<br/>
The Seventh yelled.<br/>
"Oi! Wait a second! Just now, you said woman! Fess up! Don’t tell me that you had more woman other than "mothers"! If I actually learn at this late that I have other siblings──"<br/>
When the Sixth completely fell silent, the inside of the Jewel immediately became noisy. The ancestors criticized the Sixth in turn starting from the Second.<br/>
"You, as expected that’s just……"<br/>
"I think it’s improper to keep a mistress outside. Besides, you already had other woman outside of your legal wife right?"<br/>
"The worst. It’s even worse than Lyle."<br/>
"You……what is the meaning of this! After troubling me that much, yet you were actually still hiding something huh!?"<br/>
"Spit it out! Spit out everything here!"<br/>
I thought they are noisy. Also, the Sixth’s hopelessness is getting conspicuous lately. In the Walt House’s history, the Sixth was a house head that survived through a rigorous era and expanded the territory. And yet, to think that he has a lot of hopeless sides like this…….<br/>
Then the Sixth yelled.<br/>
"Aaa~h, shut up! I already finished squaring that kind of relationships, and the Seventh has no other "sibling". That’s the truth! ……Oh, Lyle, your bait is catching something there."<br/>
The Sixth forcefully changed the topic at the end but there is nothing that can be done anyway even if the truth is exposed this late.<br/>
The fishing line caught something so I tried reeling it. The fishing rode bent. The weight I’m feeling is quiet heavy, but what came out from the river isn’t a fish.<br/>
Something with eerie color, or rather something with something slushy sticking on it is there.<br/>
I reeled it up and looked the thing dangling in midair.<br/>
「……What is, this? It has pincers.」<br/>
The Second laughed.<br/>
"That’s a crayfish. It can be eaten but, it’s safer to avoid it. Just let it go back into the river."<br/>
I followed his words and moved to let it go, but then the Second yelled.<br/>
"Oi, you idiot!"<br/>
「Ouch!」<br/>
My finger got pinched by the pincer. It happened right after I let it go, so the crayfish immediately jumped to the river after that.<br/>
「……Haa, I should go back.」<br/>
I tidied up the fishing tools. It’s also the right time so I headed to the inn to meet up with Novem and the rest.<br/>
The Third is a bit disappointed.<br/>
"Hm~, so fishing is also no good. What should we recommend next?"<br/>
I rolled the Jewel with my fingertips. The result was terrible but, it’s not like I hate fishing. But, next time I’m fishing, I want to try doing it while relaxing at a cleaner river.<br/>
I might quite like it. While waiting I can also listen to the ancestors talking to kill time, it feels like this is suited for me.<br/>
With a toolbox in my left hand and the rod in my right hand leaning on my shoulder, I walked towards the inn. While thinking that next time I’ll also invite Novem, I found Novem and the rest in an argument with someone in front of me. They are in a dark alley that is far from public eyes.<br/>
They’re in an argument with people I don’t know.<br/>
The other side is a girl with three men that she brought with her. From the atmosphere, the situation doesn’t look good at all.<br/>
The Fourth hurried me.<br/>
"That’s not an amusing sight. Lyle, hurry."<br/>
Being told that I ran to Novem and the others. There I can hear their voices. The unknown girl is yelling angrily at Novem and the others.<br/>
「I don’t know if you’re related to a feudal lord noble or what, but there is no way my pride will allow me to shrink back from someone who is expelled from her house!」<br/>
When I hurriedly came running, Aria-san and Sophia-san looked a bit relieved seeing me.<br/>
「Lyle, nice timing.」<br/>
「Certainly, this helps.」<br/>
I asked about the situation.<br/>
「Err, what happened? Or rather, what is this situation……」<br/>
Novem looked at me and shook her head.<br/>
「She is Aria-san’s acquaintance, but it seems she is displeased with my attitude. Because of that she gathered some men and came to retaliate.」<br/>
I looked at the girl and the three men behind her. The three are carrying weapons. From the swords dangling at their waists, are they adventurers…….<br/>
Then the Sixth snorted.<br/>
"They’re lowest ranked capital nobles, or else they’re second son or third sons who haven’t become independent……this girl brought a really weak bunch huh."<br/>
The Seventh is also calm.<br/>
"Well, the status of Lyle and the others right now is weak even if they were also nobles in the past. However this girl, doesn’t she have more skilled people that she can bring with her? ……No, that was rude of me. It’s stranger to expect more than this from the capital nobles."<br/>
Then the ancestors inside the Jewel simultaneously laughed. I don’t understand what is funny. There is also no time to ask so I stepped forward.<br/>
「I’ll apologize if they have done anything rude.」<br/>
The girl looked at me and scoffed.<br/>
「Aren’t you a fitting man for these ruined bunch. From your shabby appearance……adventurer? A lowly man really is suitable for these lowly girls!」<br/>
No good, her words aren’t even a reply. Or rather, it’s troubling how belligerent this girl is. The opponent is three men, but it might become something troublesome if I injured them.<br/>
From a glance I don’t feel like I’ll lose against them. Their movements are also bad, and the weapons on their waists also don’t look cared for. But, picking a fight against a noble is something I’m hesitating to do.<br/>
While I’m thinking of what to do, the rod in my right hand entered my eyes.<br/>
「Enough already. Give them a good shaking. Aim at the face for the girls. Also, you three can do whatever you like with them later. Ah, but don’t kill them. After all it’s funnier to have them live miserably.」<br/>
It’s an unthinkable way of speaking for a girl. The three at the back unsheathed their weapon, so I handed the toolbox in my left hand to Novem.<br/>
「Lyle-sama?」<br/>
「I’m fine with this thing.」<br/>
When I held up the rod, the opponents looked at my face, then they looked at each other and laughed.<br/>
「What, this guy wants to fight with a fishing rod?」<br/>
「Is that weapon on your waist just a decoration? Okay then, I’ll take it for myself while I’m at it.」<br/>
「Prepare to get embarrassed in front of those girls.」<br/>
How should I say it, it’s the first time I’m hearing lines this terrible said to me. Adventurers also have a bad mouth but, it felt like few of them are actually as horrible as these three.<br/>
I recalled the time when I fought the bandits. Ah, their atmosphere are the same like bandits. Is it fine like that, Bahnseim’s capital nobles?<br/>
I bent the rod like a whip and aimed at the hand of a man that is holding the weapon. The rod hit the back of his hand, causing the skin to swell red. The man dropped his weapon.<br/>
「Thi, this guy!」<br/>
Without pause I stepped forward and dealt a front kick at a man, next I kicked away the weapon to far away. I immediately hit another person so that he also dropped his weapon.<br/>
The Third is surprised. Not at me, but at the three men in front of me.<br/>
"There are three of them and yet they didn’t even try to surround their opponent, are these kids idiots? They’re really lacking in real battle experience."<br/>
The man that I kicked the first is crouching on the ground and writhing in pain. I kicked him first because he looked like the leader, and it seems that I’m right. The remaining two aren’t as energetic as before.<br/>
I looked at the last man pointing his weapon at me while shaking. Young. He looked the same age as me.<br/>
When I pointed my rod to him, he swung his weapon in panic.<br/>
「You! You-!」<br/>
The young man with blue hair and blue eyes is scared of me. When I kicked away the weapon in his hand, he immediately prepared to run away.<br/>
Aria-san spoke.<br/>
「Wait, that person……」<br/>
When she spoke until that far, a loud voice came.<br/>
「What are you doing there!」<br/>
When we looked at the direction of the voice, a single tall man is walking towards us. It’s a silver haired and brown skinned man with a serious face. He is wearing a mantel, but it’s obvious from his body’s movement that he is trained. Besides, the weapon hanging on his waist that is visible from the mantel’s opening is a long sword.<br/>
The men ran away in panic. The girl yelled.<br/>
「Do, don’t run! You guys, I won’t be merciful if you run away!」<br/>
The girl seemed to be strong-willed, but it seems she can’t move from fear. When the man arrived, he looked at me and the escaping men before thinking for a bit.<br/>
「……It looks like it will be better to hear about the situation a little.」<br/>
I placed the rod on my shoulder and talked to the man. The girl can’t run away because Aria-san and Sophia-san moved to stand behind her.<br/>
.<br/>
「I see, certainly she can’t complain anything even if you defended yourself. Besides, the three who ran away lost against a fishing rod? I heard that the quality of the capital nobles is low but, this is more than I imagined.」<br/>
The girl gritted her teeth and glared at us. But, the man seems to be a noble. He doesn’t show any sign of agitation at all.<br/>
The man’s name is Halite Grants──a feudal lord noble. This time he came to Centralle together with his caregiver as a guard. His skill must be really valued.<br/>
「I don’t want to say this but, picking a quarrel but then getting the table turned on you won’t get you seen in a good light. How about both sides peacefully bury the hatchet here?」<br/>
When Halite-san looked at the girl and said that, the girl finally became able to move and yelled angrily.<br/>
「You’re just a village bumpkin feudal lord noble, what’s more from a small house that is a dependent to another house. Don’t you dare talk back to me!」<br/>
Then Halite-san scratched his long silver hair with a troubled look.<br/>
「So you don’t intend to back down. How troubling. If you insult me as a village bumpkin and picked a fight with me, then I’ll have to report this to my caregiver. I’ll say to him that I’m being resented by a capital noble young lady and she might assault me.」<br/>
Then the girl is obviously starting to get shaken. Her eyes darted around. Aria-san asked for an explanation from Sophia-san.<br/>
「What is going on?」<br/>
「A caregiver feudal lord will be a Baron house at the very least. Even capital nobles will hesitate to pick a fight with such a house. After all, capital nobles only have few private soldiers of their own.」<br/>
Capital nobles lived under the protection of the king in Centralle. They don’t have any territory but have income in the form of annuity each year. They aren’t troubled with the problems of managing a territory, but it seems their income is far smaller compared to feudal lord nobles.<br/>
Halite-san sighed.<br/>
「Both sides should back away here for each other’s sake. You said your name is Lyle-kun? Do you have any objection to that?」<br/>
I nodded. It’s not like I want to take revenge or anything. Rather, I don’t want to get involved with this girl. The girl began talking, starting with saying that it can’t be helped.<br/>
「I, it can’t be helped then. I’ll kindly shut my eyes to the rudeness of the village bumpkins. Move aside!」<br/>
The girl pushed aside Aria-san and Sophia-san and walked away in indignation. Her back figure didn’t look graceful at all.<br/>
Halite-san smiled bitterly.<br/>
「You should be careful of that kind of person. But more importantly, did you really defeat three men with that fishing rod?」<br/>
It seems Halite-san is more curious about this topic.<br/>
I swung the fishing rod.<br/>
「Yes. It’s flexible and it looks like it will really be painful to get hit by it. Like this.」<br/>
The rod made a sound of cutting air, but at the same time it strongly pulled at something. A yelling voice came from somewhere.<br/>
「Wai-, KYAAAAA!!」<br/>
When we turned at the direction of the voice, the girl from before got the back of her skirt lifted up. Looking closer, the string that is stretching from my fishing rod is connected to it. The hook caught the skirt. The skirt got lifted up and the inside is completely visible.<br/>
The Second spoke in astonishment.<br/>
"Lyle, you should take off the hook properly."<br/>
The girl is flustered. The gazes of the four people surrounding me became stern. Halite-san looked at me.<br/>
「For now, let’s put down the fishing rod.」<br/>
Aria-san is,<br/>
「Lyle, let’s talk for a bit.」<br/>
Sophia-san is also angry.<br/>
「To think that Lyle-dono will do something this embarrassing.」<br/>
I made an excuse.<br/>
「Wro, wrong! This is an accident!」<br/>
The Third laughed.<br/>
"Ahahaha, Lyle is really amazing. He fished a girl with a fishing rod."<br/>
The Sixth also laughed loudly.<br/>
"You fished a big catch there! Amazing!"<br/>
It’s not a laughing matter! When I looked at Novem, she is watching me with a serious face.<br/>
「Lyle-sama, I believe that I’m mistaken but……let me say first that girl is no good. She doesn’t pass the Walt House Family Precepts.」<br/>
Novem……what kind of man do you think I am? I’m thinking to talk to her about it later while cutting the string.<br/>
Then the girl looked this way with teary eyes and then she ran away.<br/>
Toward her back, I,<br/>
「I’m sorry! It wasn’t intentional! ……Did she hear it I wonder?」<br/>
The Fourth talked to me a bit angrily.<br/>
"It’s no good even if it’s not intentional! Chase her right away and apologize!"<br/>
I chased after the girl to apologize.<br/>
.<br/>
Night.<br/>
In the inn’s dining hall, I listened about Halite-san from Novem.<br/>
「Bahnseim’s two great knights?」<br/>
Sophia-san is surprised that I don’t know about the two great knights. But, I didn’t know that Halite-san is that famous.<br/>
「He is a knight who raised great achievements at the border in Orlan. The other great knight is called the Sand Giant. However, that Halite-dono is called the Black Knight.」<br/>
Orlan is the destination city of Rondo-san’s party. Because it’s a country border, mercenaries and adventurers gather there.<br/>
Novem continued talking.<br/>
「As a border, there are a lot of chances to raise achievements there. The border with Faunbeux is calm because the princess there will marry Bahnseim’s crown prince. Recently the northern part and Orlan are the center of the skirmishes.」<br/>
Even if someone is a strong knight, they won’t be able to become famous if they don’t have the stage to raise achievements.<br/>
The Fifth taught me.<br/>
"Having something like a nickname will only get them targeted the more exaggerated the nickname is. But, if they fight while having a nickname and survived through it, then that means that they’re the real thing. Lyle right now will lose against him."<br/>
Certainly Halite-san has an aura around him. I sensed that he is really strong.<br/>
「The world is vast.」<br/>
When I said that, Aria-san recalled something and yelled.<br/>
「Ah, that’s right! Hey, about the three men who attacked us, didn’t one of them look similar to Lyle?」<br/>
Novem immediately denied when she heard that.<br/>
「He isn’t. They only have the same hair color and eye color.」<br/>
Aria-san is surprised.<br/>
「I, is that so? I, I thought they were similar though……」<br/>
Inside the Jewel, the Sixth fell into thought.<br/>
"Well, his hair and eyes were similar but, it feels like their pathetic atmosphere were also similar……. Well, it’s not really a big deal! More importantly Lyle, today was fun!"<br/>
Certainly I was able to have fun. Various things also happened which made me tired but, there is no doubt that it was a fun holiday. But, the skirt incident wasn’t my intention. I want to strongly assert that.<br/>
