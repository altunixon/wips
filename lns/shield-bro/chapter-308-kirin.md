Chapter 308: Kirin<br/>
After returning to the village by Portal, we immediately set out for Faubley.<br/>
"Firo’s carriage…"<br/>
"We had to leave it. There’s no helping it."<br/>
"Uu…"<br/>
I can’t warp while taking something of that size along.<br/>
So Firo will have to use one of the cheap carriages in the village.<br/>
One of the other Filo Rials will carry her’s back to the village later.<br/>
"Let’s do our best."<br/>
"Yeah"<br/>
I took whoever had high combat abilities with me.<br/>
The heroes were a given, and Fohl was included in that category now.<br/>
Raphtalia, Firo, Rishia, Kiel, Sadina, Taniko, Gaelion, and that Granny, whose combat experience is high (She apparently performed quite a bit in the previous battle, but I never saw it). Motoyasu’s three, and Female Knight were also brought along.<br/>
There’s also the Queen, and Trash. I don’t care about the latter, but the Queen will be useful in negotiating with their government.<br/>
"What sort of enemy is Kirin?" (Naofumi)<br/>
"I have knowledge of it from the game, but I can’t guarantee its accuracy…." (Ren)<br/>
Right… Ren’s right.<br/>
In the Houou battle, everyone’s info differed, and the real one was also different from all of them.<br/>
"Do you know anything, Queen?" (Naofumi)<br/>
"The tales describing Kirin? I’m knowledgeable of the legends, but… was it supposed to be in Faubley…?" (Queen)<br/>
"It wasn’t?"<br/>
The Queen is a lover of legends, right? At least from what I’ve seen.<br/>
Why doesn’t she know about it?<br/>
Perhaps the country of Faubley intentionally concealed the fact. It’s possible.<br/>
It’s a country made of the blood of Heroes.<br/>
There’s no way they didn’t know.<br/>
"Faubley’s gone through a long period of political upheaval, so I can’t deny the possibility of the information dying out. They also claim to be investigating the four beasts, so you may find something in their large national library." (Queen)<br/>
National Library. I believe Melty was able to remember a bit of info from a book, but what book was it?<br/>
Ah, there were a lot of Seven Stars in Faubley, right?<br/>
I may end up fighting alongside them here.<br/>
… There may be the person who caused the incident mixed in as well.<br/>
If I find them out by how they attack, I may end up killing thme.<br/>
What’s more, if there are Seven Star Heroes summoned from another world, I may be able to ask it from them.<br/>
Not that I’m expecting anything great.<br/>
Our carriages proceeded at full speed, but…<br/>
The time came, and the hourglass in my vision enlarged.<br/>
This time, it displayed a "9".<br/>
But that doesn’t really matter.<br/>
The problem is what came afterwards.<br/>
I guess it was after about an hour.<br/>
Firo was surpassing her limits, and running at breakneck speed. We were storming down the streets of the country neighboring Faubley.<br/>
Suddenly… the number vanished.<br/>
I stopped the carriage, and called out to the Queen, and the heroes.<br/>
"What’s this about?" (Naofumi)<br/>
"What happened?" (Queen)<br/>
"Yeah, the hourglass vanished. As if the beast had already been defeated." (Naofumi)<br/>
"Naofumi, mine’s gone too." (Ren)<br/>
"Fumu…" (Naofumi)<br/>
Faubley has their own heroes.<br/>
So it’s not impossible.<br/>
How many of them are there right now?<br/>
Um… Trash and Fohl are Seven Stars… what about Rishia?<br/>
Unlike Fohl’s, hers has settled into a translucent state.<br/>
I really don’t think it’s a Legendary Weapon, so what exactly is it?<br/>
Anyways, there are five more of the Seven Stars, so it’s not that strange if they were able to beat Kirin.<br/>
Then why would people with that sort of power refrain from participating in the Houou battle? It’s strange no matter how you look at it.<br/>
"Queen, does Faubley have all of the other Seven Star Heroes?" (Naofumi)<br/>
"I’ve heard that five of them mainly operate from their lands. Of course, they also visit other countries." (Queen)<br/>
So Faubley has all of the rest.<br/>
And Trash and the Four Summoned are centered in Melromark.<br/>
It appears we were equal in numbers.<br/>
There’s someone among them that I can never forgive.<br/>
The enemies summoned in the wave… It’s possible that someone like Glass appeared there as well.<br/>
If that’s the case, they might be trying to get the Heroes to kill each other.<br/>
But I won’t stand by false charges.<br/>
I’ll deliver retribution unto the true culprit.<br/>
But…<br/>
There’s one large problem.<br/>
The number on the blue hourglass is gone.<br/>
No, the blue hourglass Icon itself is gone.<br/>
In its place is the normal Red Hourglass, counting down time to the next wave.<br/>
One Week.<br/>
It’s certain that something defeated the wave, be it the Seven Star Heroes, or something else. Then where did Ouryuu go?<br/>
I turn my eyes to Gaelion.<br/>
"KYUA!" (Gaelion)<br/>
Taniko’s cuddling with him.<br/>
I want to somehow call true Gaelion out, but…<br/>
From the start, he doesn’t come out before Ren or Taniko.<br/>
… Kirin’s gone. Ouryuu’s left.<br/>
Even if he is set to appear, I have no idea where it’ll be.<br/>
It would be troublesome if he appeared with little warning like this time.<br/>
I need to ask for the location.<br/>
"Ren, Itsuki, Motoyasu, where does Ouryuu revive?" (Naofumi)<br/>
"Over there." (Ren)<br/>
"Here." (Itsuki)<br/>
"That way, Father-in-Law." (Motoyasu)<br/>
They each point in different directions altogether.<br/>
They’re all over the place…<br/>
We can’t determine its location. I never expected this.<br/>
"I-it seems we don’t know Ouryuu’s location." (Ren)<br/>
Ren seems to be bewildered.<br/>
Yeah.<br/>
I mean, everyone’s disagreeing here.<br/>
There’s no choice.<br/>
We’ll put Ouryuu off ‘til later. I’ll get what I can from Gaelion.<br/>
"I’m going to ride Gaelion, and observe Faubley’s situation from the sky." (Naofumi)<br/>
"What about Firo?" (Firo)<br/>
"You can come along if you want. Along with Gaelion." (Naofumi)<br/>
Perhaps that was a bit forced. But since Ren and Taniko are with us, we’ll have to fly up high to speak.<br/>
Taniko tries to get on him, but Gaelion rejects her, and begins beating his wings.<br/>
I straddle Firo, and we lift off.<br/>
"… And? Tell me everything you know about Ouryuu." (Naofumi)<br/>
"Sorry. I know nothing." (Gaelion)<br/>
I look towards Faubley from up high.<br/>
I see something like a speck in the distance… Is that it?<br/>
I can’t tell what’s going down there.<br/>
"So you aren’t the dragon?" (Naofumi)<br/>
"It may be an assimilation of the Dragon Emperor cores…" (Gaelion)<br/>
Fumu… because Ouryuu’s seal isn’t breaking, the blue hourglass didn’t appear. Can I look at it like that?<br/>
–<br/>
After I conversed with Gaelion, we stopped by a small country.<br/>
To easily cross Faubley’s border, the Queen stopped by the castle of said country, and came out quickly.<br/>
"Iwatani-sama, I have found out what became of Kirin." (Queen)<br/>
Well, it’s not like I didn’t hear any gossip on the city’s streets, but hearing the Queen’s, and Shadow’s information is for the best.<br/>
"The Heroes in Faubley led the army, and managed to subjugate it. The damage caused was 0. Absolutely none." (Queen)<br/>
"I see… that’s good."<br/>
Still, the one who killed off Atlas, and our armies may be there.<br/>
Just by thinking that, I feel I need to get there immediately, and make him taste the same, no an even greater pain than that he inflicted on Atlas.<br/>
"And? How many of their Seven Star Heroes participated?" (Naofumi)<br/>
"That’s the strange thing. Apparently, it was only one." (Queen)<br/>
"One…?" (Naofumi)<br/>
One, is it? There seems to be a capable person among them.<br/>
But what the hell were the other heroes doing?<br/>
They didn’t even go help out with Houou. They didn’t fight the Kirin that appeared right next to them.<br/>
It’s as if they’re useless.<br/>
"We’re still going to confirm the truth. For Atlas, and the other’s sake as well." (Naofumi)<br/>
"I understand. I’ve already sent messengers ahead to grant us an audience with Faubley immediately." (Queen)<br/>
On the Queen’s orders, the country we stopped in sent messengers to Faubley.<br/>
They were on flying dragons, so they shouldn’t take long.<br/>
The problem is if we’re setting out yet or not…<br/>
"Should we rush there?" (Queen)<br/>
"Fue…" (Firo)<br/>
Firo’s collapsed on her own carriage.<br/>
She’s just fought a series of battles.<br/>
Though she claims she’s fine, she must be pushing herself.<br/>
We should rest, if only for a bit.<br/>
I bet Faubley will take a while to gather their Heroes as well, so we should rest when we have the chance.<br/>
"No, let’s rest, and recover our strength." (Naofumi)<br/>
"Understood." (Queen)<br/>
Like that, the third of the four beasts was defeated, and the wave’s hourglass turned red once more.<br/>
