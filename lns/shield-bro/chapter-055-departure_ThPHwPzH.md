5 Chapters in 10 hours..... not bad I guess. <br/>
Chapter 55 <br/>
 <br/>
Departure <br/>
 <br/>
"I demand Decapitatiooooooooooon!" <br/>
 <br/>
As expected of trash.  My answer is equivalent to your crown. <br/>
 <br/>
"Opps, it looks like you think your guillotine can hurt me" <br/>
 <br/>
With a clang, the knights of the trash take out their swords and surround me. <br/>
 <br/>
"Did you guys forget during the wave the I am the one who defeated the opponent those other heroes got trashed by?" <br/>
 <br/>
I equip my shield and answer. <br/>
As for the knights, none of them dare to move. <br/>
An appearance befitting a hero. These are people that know of what happened during the wave, so they do not attack. <br/>
Even if it was a half bluff. <br/>
 <br/>
"What are you doing! kill this impudent bastard already!" <br/>
"Hey......" <br/>
 <br/>
I glare at the trash king and repeat. <br/>
 <br/>
"Do you not understand? The present me can enter the castle from the entrance, murder you, and walk out just like that......" <br/>
"Grrr......" <br/>
 <br/>
At last, this trash seems to finally know his position. His face is mortified. <br/>
 <br/>
"Do you believe I can actually do it?" <br/>
 <br/>
I learnt that in this world threats and bluffs during negotiations are necessary. Therefore, against this trash I'll use it to the maximum. <br/>
 <br/>
"If you're going to request a hero to do it, do you think they can win against me?" <br/>
"Grrrrr......." <br/>
 <br/>
The trash is grinding his teeth with frustration. <br/>
 <br/>
"Being able to say such a thing--" <br/>
"If you harm my subordinates? I'll kill you." <br/>
 <br/>
Before I lose the possibility I will take the first move. <br/>
Since I have no clarification, I don't know whether or not the Iron Maiden skill can kill this trash. <br/>
But, I'm quite sure it will work. <br/>
If I also include the flames from the Self-Curse Burning. <br/>
The trash's expression turns blue when he understands his position. <br/>
 <br/>
"Do not bother me trash. I will co-operate during a wave, but once it is over do not disturb me." <br/>
 <br/>
This is my only threat but I cannot reveal my trump card easily. I'd prefer that to be my last resort. <br/>
Even if I kill him here nothing will be solved. This trash's successor will just appear and put me on the wanted list. <br/>
Even if I fight the other Heroes it is doubtful that I can win. <br/>
Besides, if all three of them team up on me I will lose. <br/>
 <br/>
"See ya" <br/>
 <br/>
I turn my heal and walk out of the throne room. <br/>
 <br/>
"Unforgivable! I won't forgive you Shieeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeld!" <br/>
 <br/>
The trash's scream resounds throughout the throne room. <br/>
 <br/>
"That's my lineeeeeeeeeeeeeee!" <br/>
 <br/>
I pointed at the trash before leaving. <br/>
After leaving the throne room I pss by a noble woman-like person. <br/>
Concealing her lips with a fan and an expensive looking dress. <br/>
The face is too well concealed to be able to tell her age. <br/>
Perhaps late 20s......? <br/>
Her hair is purple......Quite a rare colour...... <br/>
 <br/>
"thank you for participating degojaru <br/>
 <br/>
Was whispered to me as we passed each other. <br/>
Gojaru? <br/>
Dangerous, I almost turned around. <br/>
Hm? <br/>
A girl just like Raphtalia when she was small and Firo's humanoid form is behind the woman. <br/>
Her hair colour is bluish. Also something you don't see much. <br/>
She is dressed well, is she her child? <br/>
However, they don't really resemble each other...... <br/>
Though she her looks rivals that of Firo's human form. Is this little girl also a bird? <br/>
Hm...... <br/>
I cannot remember who she looks like. <br/>
Oh well, that person is probably unpleasant. Remembering is just a waste of time. <br/>
 <br/>
So, at that time, we just crossed paths unintentionally. <br/>
I had no idea this kid would become an important figure in a future uproar. <br/>
 <br/>
By the way, Raphtalia and Firo were waiting for me in another room. <br/>
And the fact that they predicted I would cause trouble and was even ready for escape was icing on the cake. <br/>
Anyway, we left there in a hurry. <br/>
 <br/>
The next day. <br/>
I show up at the equipment store, to check on the requested carriage. <br/>
 <br/>
"Oh it's the lad. The carriage you asked for is done." <br/>
"Pretty quick.  However old man, can you make anything as long as it's metal based?" <br/>
"I had my acquaintance help out, so I didn't make all of it." <br/>
 <br/>
Is this common for metal workers? <br/>
 <br/>
"Well, he's just one of those guys that can do anything as long as you have money." <br/>
"Lad, don't be sad just because you found out I can't do everything. I'm not versatile like you." <br/>
"I'm not omnipotent either......" <br/>
 <br/>
What does the old man think of me? <br/>
 <br/>
"Well it's parked in the back." <br/>
"Ah then let's check it out. By the way, Raphtalia-" <br/>
 <br/>
Raphtalia grasps my hand before I finish. <br/>
 <br/>
"What's wrong?" <br/>
"This sword is still fine. Let's conserve money for now." <br/>
"Well..... If Raphtalia says so...... <br/>
 <br/>
Though Firo is now our main attacker. <br/>
It shouldn't be necessary for Raphtalia to act unless it's urgent, the same goes for me. <br/>
This sounds bad, but there may be weapons somewhere else that are better than the ones in the old man's shop. <br/>
We went around the equipment store to check out the metal wagon. <br/>
The hood is metallic, and the whole carriage feels like an enlarged Christmas ornament that my parents bought. <br/>
 <br/>
"Wow~......" <br/>
 <br/>
Firo's eyes are shining with unprecedented brightness. She heads towards the front and grabs the handle. <br/>
 <br/>
"Firo is going to pull this right!?" <br/>
"Yeah" <br/>
"Yaay~!" <br/>
 <br/>
Firo is quite happy, both her feet and wings are flapping, as if wanting to bolt off at any moment.  <br/>
She has such a face. <br/>
 <br/>
"For the time being let's carry in your luggage." <br/>
"Okay" <br/>
"Okay~!" <br/>
 <br/>
We transfer the baggage from our carriage that we used in between waves to the new one. <br/>
It took quite some time to carry the materials, merchandise, and tools. <br/>
 <br/>
"How is it lad?" <br/>
 <br/>
The old man from shows up when he has free time. And I answer with a thumbs up. <br/>
 <br/>
"yeah, it's as great as I expected." <br/>
"I see, but it seems to be very heavy, will the little missy be fine......?" <br/>
"Yup!" <br/>
"This fellow here ran around the country with a carriage that had 3 carts attached." <br/>
"That's amazing" <br/>
"Rather, it's lighter than I expected so I'm a little disappointed." <br/>
"You know, stop being so stubborn!" <br/>
 <br/>
What are the standards for Philo Rial anyway? Why do they feel great when they pull carriages? <br/>
 <br/>
"Hahaha, do your best. So what'll you do from now on?" <br/>
"What will I do?" <br/>
"I heard about the commotion at the castle." <br/>
 <br/>
The old man says to me with a somewhat troubled face. <br/>
 <br/>
"That sure travelled quick" <br/>
"Rumours keep the town lively." <br/>
"Oh well. I did is so that trash would understand his position."  <br/>
"......Though it's only a matter of time before you get falsely accused again." <br/>
"That's what I expected." <br/>
"If possible I don't want to know." <br/>
"I believe I asked this some time ago...... Are you going to go to Silt Welt or ShirudoFuriden to Class up? <br/>
(Tl note: Still need some help for names of countries.  シルトヴェルト (Silt Welt) シルドフリーデン (Shirudo Furiden) <br/>
 <br/>
A few things come to mind when, and what I should have done when threatening trash is also get permission to use the Hourglass of the Dragon's era. But if the class up is controlled by the trash I will also fear for Raphtalia and Firo. <br/>
I would rather not have that unnecessary anxiety haunting me.  <br/>
It would be best to get a free pass for Class up in any of these two countries. <br/>
 <br/>
"Well, I expected you to go to be forced to leave this country someday." <br/>
"What?" <br/>
 <br/>
It seems the old man is nodding his head as if agreeing with himself. <br/>
What does he mean? <br/>
 <br/>
"I would recommend you going to ShiruFuriden. Silt Welt is in turmoil......" <br/>
"Is that so?" <br/>
"Yeah, humans there are treated just like the demi-humans in this country." <br/>
 <br/>
No wonder...... It would be unsuitable for me who is a human. <br/>
 <br/>
"But--" <br/>
"Thanks for the help. I'll be going to ShirudoFuriden" <br/>
 <br/>
We finished loading and got into the carriage. <br/>
 <br/>
"Well then, I expect you to visit a great number of shops." <br/>
"Thanks, Oh right. Do you know of any weapons that have a soul attribute, or can damage ghosts?" <br/>
"I see, so you've gotten to the point where you need to prepare for such enemies." <br/>
"I can make something cheaply from certain materials." <br/>
"I cannot match you any more. If possible don't come back for a while. I'll tell you where you can get materials." <br/>
"I understand. Thanks for all the help. Then, let's go." <br/>
"Okay~" <br/>
"See ya. old man." <br/>
"Later" <br/>
 <br/>
Firo pulls the rattling carriage. <br/>
Our present goal is a Class up. It seems to be quite far into the future. <br/>
With Firo's running speed we should arrive in two weeks. <br/>
 <br/>
"Thats!" <br/>
 <br/>
I hear a loud voice outside. <br/>
Before leaving the castle town a something hits the metal carriage. <br/>
 <br/>
"I found you!" <br/>
"......What?" <br/>
 <br/>
After making Firo stop, a little girl looks into the carriage and points at me. <br/>
Behind the girl is a knight-like guy. <br/>
These guys seems to have followed us for a while. <br/>
 <br/>
"You did something terrible to father!" <br/>
"Hmm?" <br/>
 <br/>
What? The girl with blue hair that I am not familiar with gets closer. <br/>
 <br/>
"What's with you." <br/>
"Don't play dumb! I know that you can't hide it! You are an accomplished villain! The atrocious Hero of the Shield!" <br/>
 <br/>
This goddamn noisy kid. Is she some aristocrat? <br/>
That reminds me, I sold some cheap accessory to a noble before. <br/>
Though it wasn't just once or twice. I can't remember how many times any more. <br/>
 <br/>
"I see, your father just can't tell quality. I am just smarter." <br/>
"What did you say!?" <br/>
 <br/>
But, Hero of the Shield = Evil person..... That's quite unpleasant. <br/>
Oh well, it's too late now. <br/>
 <br/>
"Tell you father. To polish his aesthetic sense next time." <br/>
"Boo,Boo...... I'll never admit it, mother is wrong, the Hero of the Shield is a bad person! I'll punish you!" <br/>
 <br/>
The subordinate knights step forward according to the girl's order. <br/>
 <br/>
"Hm. can you keep them company Firo?" <br/>
"what~?" <br/>
"Just go." <br/>
"Okay" <br/>
"Ah......" <br/>
 <br/>
Firo stares at the goddamn kid and seems preoccupied. <br/>
 <br/>
"Holy Bird?" <br/>
"Eh?" <br/>
 <br/>
Firo inclines her neck and looks at the goddamn kid puzzled. <br/>
 <br/>
"Hurry up and go!" <br/>
"Okay~" <br/>
 <br/>
Firo nods, and the carriage suddenly takes off. <br/>
 <br/>
"AH Wait---------------! Don'r run awaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaay!" <br/>
 <br/>
The voice of the goddamn kid fades into the distance. <br/>
The castle town sucks as expected. Other than coming for shopping I would rather stay away.
