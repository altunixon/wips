<br/>
TLN: *Cough*<br/>
This may sound strange after giving out a schedule, but…double chapter! Haha.<br/>
I felt like this fell into the category of ‘not enough meat’ and I normally stick 2 chapters together now whenever this happens, but this time around the 2 chapters didn’t have much in common to do so, so I decided not to.<br/>
Anyways, enjoy the chapter! :DDD!<br/>
<br/>
You can’t see Spirits.<br/>
Spirits are whimsical.<br/>
Spirits are everywhere. They are currently flying around you.<br/>
You can’t hear the voice of the Spirits.<br/>
But you can speak to them.<br/>
A long time ago, in an era when the Titan Gods spoke to the Spirits. <br/>
This is a summary of a part of the conversation at that time. <br/>
[1st day 1st minute, Spirit Magic you can do from day one.]<br/>
"Didn’t they have any other title?" (Makoto) <br/>
I was lying on the surface of the water while flipping through the pages of the book Mary-san lended me. <br/>
The place is the waterway at the back of the Adventurer Guild.<br/>
The guild has a learning area, but according to this book, there’s more Water Spirits in places with water.<br/>
"Let’s try chanting something for now." (Makoto) <br/>
The pronunciation of the spirit language is difficult as well as speaking it. <br/>
But it says that unless I don’t do the pronunciation right, it doesn’t reach the Spirits. <br/>
But once it does, the effects are impressive. You can even do things like changing the weather, or generating enough water to make a flood.<br/>
1,000 years ago, there were a whole lot of human Spirit Users as well, but they have died out. <br/>
I wonder why. <br/>
"Ah, Makoto-kun, what are you doing?!" <br/>
I was found by Emily. <br/>
Right, she did tell me I still have to rest this week.<br/>
"Reading a book." (Makoto) <br/>
"You are using Surface Walk!" (Emily!) <br/>
"This much should be okay, right? Jean’s not with you?" (Makoto) <br/>
Let’s change the topic using Jean. <br/>
"Today we are taking a break from adventuring. Doing it everyday would accumulate fatigue. More importantly, Makoto-kun, get out!" (Emily)<br/>
I couldn’t trick her.<br/>
No choice but to move from the waterway to the ground.<br/>
"Geez, even though I told Lucy to keep an eye on you." (Emily)<br/>
"You told her something like that, huh. But Lucy herself is in the middle of training." (Makoto)<br/>
She has been trying harder and harder lately.<br/>
I would like to go on adventures together.<br/>
"By the way, what book are you reading?" (Emily)<br/>
Emily peeks at it.<br/>
"A Spirit Language book." (Makoto)<br/>
"Oh, feel like you can use it? Ah, but don’t, okay? Only when you get better." (Emily)<br/>
"I only began studying yesterday. No way I can use it immediately." (Makoto)<br/>
"Hmm, but Spirit Magic is pretty rare. You are the first I see that can use it." (Emily)<br/>
Right. <br/>
I am the only user in the Adventurer Guild, so I don’t even know if it is awesome or not.<br/>
In the first place…<br/>
"The pronunciation is incredibly hard. That might have been the reason it died out." (Makoto)<br/>
"Really?" (Emily)<br/>
"Yeah, for example; even a short sentence like, [Water Overflow], is…" (Makoto)<br/>
XXXXXXXXXXX<br/>
I speak out what’s written in the book.<br/>
"I couldn’t really pick up what you said." (Emily)<br/>
"Right? It has been really tough learning up to this po—" (Makoto)<br/>
I only managed to say til that part…before a large amount of water poured on my head.<br/>
It must have taken around 5 seconds.<br/>
What’s there now is a completely drenched Emily and I.<br/>
"Hey…Makoto-kun?" (Emily)<br/>
She glared at me.<br/>
Her bright dyed brown hair had turned into a dark gray, and her baggy priest clothes were now showing her body line perfectly.<br/>
You have a pretty nice body there, Emily-san.<br/>
Wait, that’s not it.<br/>
"Sorry…" (Makoto)<br/>
Let’s apologize first.<br/>
I didn’t expect it to activate so easily.<br/>
"Haah, just what are you doing? Even though these are the clothes I had Jean buy me… Even my underwear is completely wet now." (Emily)<br/>
"I am really sorry. Wait a bit, I will dry it real quick." (Makoto)<br/>
"There’s no way it will dry so qui—" (Emily)<br/>
I lightly touch Emily’s clothes.<br/>
[Water Magic: Evaporation]<br/>
I take out the water from the clothes of Emily.<br/>
If I overdo it, I will injure the clothes.<br/>
It is magic that requires pretty minute control.<br/>
"Eh? Eeeeeh?!" (Emily)<br/>
Emily’s clothes return to normal in a few seconds.<br/>
"W-What’s this?" (Emily)<br/>
"I dried you with Water Magic. It is normal." (Makoto)<br/>
"It is not! I haven’t seen this magic before. Wow, incredible! Even my panties are dry." (Emily)<br/>
Too much information.<br/>
I cough.<br/>
"Haah, your magic is truly amazing." (Emily)<br/>
"Uhm, you okay now?" (Makoto)<br/>
Emily lets out a sigh and is using her hand to fix her hair. <br/>
"Well, fine. I can allow reading, but don’t go training just yet, okay? You have to rest this week." (Emily)<br/>
After saying this, Emily leaves.<br/>
Looks like she has forgiven me for getting her drenched.<br/>
What a relief.<br/>
◇◇<br/>
I fall into thought now that I am alone.<br/>
The large amount of water that came pouring down on top of us…where did it come from?<br/>
It far exceeds what my mana can generate. <br/>
Even so, it is not water I controlled from the waterway.<br/>
The quality of the water was different from the water in Makkaren.<br/>
"The Spirits generated it?" (Makoto)<br/>
That easily?<br/>
With a few words?<br/>
I look around.<br/>
Emily isn’t here anymore.<br/>
XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX [Water Overflow].<br/>
In an instant, a massive amount of water appears.<br/>
[Water Magic: Water Current].<br/>
I control the water.<br/>
It turned into a giant waterball.<br/>
T-This is…! <br/>
I can use this.<br/>
Have the Spirits generate the water, and control it.<br/>
I might be able to fight even when not around a water source.<br/>
A-Alright.<br/>
I will try using it in my next adventure.<br/>
I unsheathe my dagger and put both of my hands together.<br/>
Goddess-sama, thank you very much.<br/>
(Good good, devote yourself.) (Noah)<br/>
Lucy appeared while I was praying.<br/>
"What are you doing?" (Lucy)<br/>
"I am thanking the Goddess." (Makoto)<br/>
"…I see." (Lucy)<br/>
Looks like she is in a bad mood. <br/>
She is still dragging the anger from yesterday?<br/>
"Just now, Emily told me that you got her completely wet. What was that about?" (Lucy)<br/>
"?!" (Makoto)<br/>
Emily-san! <br/>
Didn’t you forgive me?<br/>
"What are you doing getting all happy by pouring water onto girls when you are not a kid anymore…" (Lucy)<br/>
Lucy-san’s eyes weren’t those of anger but scorn!<br/>
"That’s not it!" (Makoto)<br/>
Even when I activated [Clear Mind], it was at the moment when I was already panicking.<br/>
After that, Jean was also fuming too.<br/>
