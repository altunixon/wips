SS: Lulu's Pests Extermination<br/>
<br/>
Â <br/>
<Author's Note: This is an SS with Liza's POV, not Satou.><br/>
<br/>
"Ufufu, you're bad you know? Since you've put your hands on other people's thing..."<br/>
<br/>
What should I do, Lulu seems strange.<br/>
<br/>
"Now, be obediently exterminated."<br/>
<br/>
When I look at Lulu who's holding a kitchen knife on her hand while having a dark smile, I feel a slight cold on my back.<br/>
<br/>
"Ara ara, are you scared? Pulling your hands and feet back like that. Are you trying to hide it by doing that?"<br/>
<br/>
I'm at a loss as to whether call Lulu who's speaking like she's driving it into the corner, but since she'll be still speaking when master come soon, let's stop her now.<br/>
<br/>
"Now, resign yourself--"<br/>
"Lulu."<br/>
<br/>
When I called her, Lulu very quickly turned her body around. Looking at the kitchen knife being hold in both hands like she's going to thrust it sure is scary.<br/>
<br/>
"D, did you see?"<br/>
"No, I didn't. Rather than that, master is coming, so you should end your little drama, and quickly finish catching the vegetable bugs."<br/>
"P, please Liza-san, about this, to master--"<br/>
<br/>
Lulu who's drawing near in a panic looks cute, but since she's still holding the kitchen knife, I lightly take it off. Since it's dangerous.<br/>
<br/>
I promise the nondisclosure, "I swear that I did not seen anything" to Lulu. As a thank for keeping it a secret, Lulu is going to give me the thick slice of the steak today. I did not have such intention, but the meat has no sin. I will gladly accept it.<br/>
<br/>
"What's wrong Liza? You look happy about something."<br/>
"No, it is nothing."<br/>
<br/>
This is a secret between girls after all, so I'm keeping it a secret from master.<br/>
