15-Intermission 7. The Journey of John Smith<br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
This is before the Divine Punishment chronologically.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
"Yohn Fmith, tis s'far we can accomfany you."<br/>
"Thank you, Holphelp. I'll look for another caravan from here on--and also, the name's John Smith."<br/>
<br/>
I said my thanks to the deerkin man.<br/>
<br/>
After leaving the northern part of Shiga Kingdom, I headed west to the center of the Center Small Kingdoms together with a caravan troupe.<br/>
The highway in the Center Small Kingdoms was in bad shape compared to Shiga Kingdom's, much of it was uneven and blocked.<br/>
<br/>
The most problematic thing was the monsters.<br/>
I almost died many times thanks to that.<br/>
<br/>
During those times, I was 'coincidentally' saved by caravan troupes and wandering adventurers who happened to pass by.<br/>
At first I was proud of my good luck, but even I started to have my suspicion when [Stone Wolves] and [Moving Wood Bears] began to save me.<br/>
<br/>
It's probably the work of the guy who gave me this arm, but I don't understand his objective.<br/>
Since he neither contacts me or restricts my actions....<br/>
<br/>
"●●●　●！"<br/>
"Ah, my bad. I still don't really get the language around here."<br/>
<br/>
I look for a caravan heading west while ignoring a sexy female peddler with brown skin.<br/>
I can't negotiate with people who don't speak Shiga Kingdom's or Saga Empire's language.<br/>
<br/>
Woulda loved Appraisal or Language skills, not even asking for cheat skills here.<br/>
<br/>
"Onii-san with the flat face over there, care to have some Riuch's fried rice?"<br/>
"Whaddya mean by flat--"<br/>
<br/>
I was speechless when I looked at the master of the voice.<br/>
An odd guy who looks like a plastered wall covered by moss is standing there.<br/>
<br/>
I'm sure he'd be popular in a theme park.<br/>
<br/>
"Onii-san, is this your first time seeing a Mosskin?"<br/>
"Ah, sorry for staring at ya--how much's for the fried rice?"<br/>
<br/>
I could see raisin-like things among the unknown meat and vegetables mixed in the steamy fried rice that's being fried.<br/>
It's different from the Chinese-style fried rice I know, but it looks quite good.<br/>
<br/>
"One full bowl of this is one copper coin."<br/>
"Give me two bowls."<br/>
<br/>
I pay him with the warped copper coins of the Center Small Kingdoms, not of the Shiga Kingdom.<br/>
<br/>
Although there are slight differences in size, copper coins can be used in most countries.<br/>
Since the rate of exchange for silver coins is different when I'm going back, I'm prioritizing using up the copper coins which worth relatively less.<br/>
<br/>
"Give me the bowl back once you're done with it."<br/>
"Yea, got it."<br/>
<br/>
I taste the fried rice at once.<br/>
<br/>
A bit salty, but it's good.<br/>
No, maybe because I sweat a lot in the long trip this saltiness tastes irresistibly good.<br/>
The unknown meat seems to have been pre-seasoned, it adds depth to the usually monotonous-tasting fried rice.<br/>
<br/>
I couldn't stop my hand from spooning the fried rice into my mouth.<br/>
Right when the saltiness about to get too intense, sweetness spread on my tongue.<br/>
<br/>
--Was that raisin just now.<br/>
<br/>
After getting reset by the sweetness, the stimulating saltiness and the umami from the unknown meat hit me like a brick again.<br/>
<br/>
This stall owner is quite good despite his plastered-wall-like face.<br/>
It's as if he's the rumored [Miracle Chef] of Shiga Kingdom.<br/>
<br/>
"This is some good stuff. Is this sweetness from raisin?"<br/>
"That's from date palms."<br/>
<br/>
Date palms?<br/>
<br/>
"My cousin is selling baskets of it at the stall over there if you're interested."<br/>
"I see, gotta buy some later."<br/>
"If you're going, you should try your luck at the stall in front of the date palm's."<br/>
<br/>
Hmm, is it a dice gambling or a rat race?<br/>
Taking a peek should be fun.<br/>
<br/>
I memorized the stall's direction and held out the bowl to the mosskin.<br/>
<br/>
"Another bowl please."<br/>
<br/>
Good food in a trip is a once-in-a-lifetime encounter.<br/>
You don't know if you'll ever get to eat it again later on.<br/>
<br/>
I decided to slowly enjoy my third bowl.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
◇<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
"--Rubik's Cubes?"<br/>
<br/>
Toy Rubik's Cube I'm familiar with are lined up on the stall, though they might be of a different kind since they have five square rows on each side.<br/>
<br/>
"Yo, niisan, wanna try your luck?"<br/>
"Luck?"<br/>
"Yeah! Turn this square thing like this and."<br/>
<br/>
The stall keeper called me while stroking his well-groomed beard.<br/>
He lifted up a cube and turned it around, and then he played with it and made one side full of the same color.<br/>
<br/>
"You'd get some luxurious premium stuff if you can get it like this on two sides and more."<br/>
<br/>
The stall keeper showed various articles exhibited behind him.<br/>
The fifth and sixth prizes are of dummies instead of the real things, probably to prevent crime.<br/>
<br/>
"Saga Empire's--『Appraisal Orb』, and the other one is 『Interpreter Earrings』?"<br/>
<br/>
The 10 gold coins prize when you get four sides of the same color is attractive, though it's probably fake.<br/>
My funds have been running dry, this is just right.<br/>
<br/>
I'm good at Rubik's Cube if I do say so myself.<br/>
<br/>
But, before that--.<br/>
<br/>
"By the way master, there's no way you can get five sides of the same color without getting six too right? Why do you have a fifth prize?"<br/>
<br/>
The stall keeper sighed greatly at my question.<br/>
<br/>
"Not all of them are as educated as you y'see."<br/>
"No well, either way isn't it just obvious?"<br/>
"That's not exactly true. If I left out the fifth prize, there'd be a lot of folks asking, 『Don't you have a fifth prize?』. Explaining to them that they'd always get six colored sides when they get five every time is troublesome, so I just put up a prize for it."<br/>
<br/>
I see....<br/>
<br/>
"Then that means there's no fifth prize?"<br/>
"Hm? I'll let you have it if you can get six sides on the same color."<br/>
<br/>
The stall keeper put on a face like he was saying "try it if you can" while waving his hand.<br/>
<br/>
That attitude only fires me up.<br/>
Let's get to the point.<br/>
<br/>
"Is there a time limit?"<br/>
"Only until this hourglass drops. I'll let ya reverse it when it does if you pay me another 10 copper coins."<br/>
"As many times as I want?"<br/>
"As many times as you want s'long you have the cash."<br/>
<br/>
I see, good thinking.<br/>
This would hook people who have low gambling-resistant to put out all their money.<br/>
<br/>
I confirm the cash I have on hands.<br/>
Doing it on the first try is impossible.<br/>
<br/>
But I should be able to get all of them with four silver coins, no, five.<br/>
<br/>
"First time is only five copper coins."<br/>
"Is that fine with one side cleared like this?"<br/>
"Think of it as a service for beginner."<br/>
<br/>
The stall keeper started the hourglass at the same time I started moving the Rubik's cube.<br/>
I easily cleared two sides after a few rotations.<br/>
<br/>
"Whoa, ain't ya a promising newbie! You already got two sides! How bout it? You'd get one small silver coin if you stop here."<br/>
<br/>
You're one to talk after letting it easy for me to get two sides.<br/>
The stall keeper raised his voices while smiling indifferently, attracting the peanut gallery around.<br/>
<br/>
I'm not good with attentions, but I can't use [Burying] in this situation.<br/>
I concentrate on the Rubik's Cube while telling myself [That's a pumpkin], [This one's a cabbage] in my mind.<br/>
<br/>
"Aah! He broke it off after getting four sides!"<br/>
"T-ten gold coins!"<br/>
"That guy, oh no."<br/>
<br/>
I frantically move my hands while ignoring the peanut gallery.<br/>
<br/>
My wallet has already been emptied.<br/>
I've got to clear all sides before the last hourglass no matter what!<br/>
<br/>
"Oh oh oh, almost all the sand's fallen."<br/>
<br/>
The stall keeper deliberately tried to hurry me up.<br/>
<br/>
"Aaah, oh no oh no oh no."<br/>
<br/>
Ah, geez.<br/>
The oh-no woman is noisy.<br/>
<br/>
"3,2,1--"<br/>
<br/>
--Got it!<br/>
<br/>
"Ze--"<br/>
<br/>
I held out the cube right before the stall keeper could fully declare zero.<br/>
The stall keeper's face was hardened in surprise.<br/>
<br/>
"Whoaaaaa!"<br/>
"First time I see someone did it."<br/>
"●●●●●!"<br/>
"●●●! You're awesome!"<br/>
<br/>
Surprises and congratulations welled up among the peanut gallery.<br/>
<br/>
I confirm the stall keeper's reaction while feeling embarrassed.<br/>
If this guy tries to run away, I've got to get the money I paid him at least.<br/>
<br/>
"Ah! The box!"<br/>
"What the heck?!"<br/>
"Sand?"<br/>
<br/>
The cube I submitted collapsed into six-colored glittering sand.<br/>
The stall keeper snatches an obsidian ring-like thing inside the sand.<br/>
<br/>
"Hahaha, this is it! This is one of the artifacts hidden inside 『Cube of Myriad Truth』! You did well youngster! These are your promised rewards. Accept them!"<br/>
<br/>
The ecstatic stall keeper took out an Orb and earrings from item box-like black cross-section and threw them to me.<br/>
<br/>
"I'll give you these gold and silver pouches too. Take all the remaining stuff too! ■■■■...."<br/>
<br/>
I caught the things the stall keeper threw and put it inside my bosom.<br/>
<br/>
"....　■ Fly"<br/>
<br/>
The stall keeper floated, and flew to the southwest direction while laughing loudly.<br/>
With his lines earlier and all these mid-boss-like things he did, I don't wanna go anywhere near southwest.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
◇<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
"--Not here?"<br/>
<br/>
I bought date palms to be my preserved food in the trips, and signed a contract to board a caravan's sand boat heading to the one of the most prosperous trade country among the western ones, Garleon Union.<br/>
After hearing that caravan would embark tomorrow, I went back to the stall that served the superb fried rice earlier, but it was already vacated.<br/>
<br/>
"Excuse me, when is the stall here going to open in the morning?"<br/>
"Huh? The guy that was there just opened today. A catkin and a dogkin brats came to pick him up."<br/>
"Hmm, you think he's gonna open again tomorrow?"<br/>
"Who knows."<br/>
<br/>
I purchase sand rate skewers from the stall of this indifference old man.<br/>
<br/>
--Eurgh.<br/>
<br/>
Sand is gritting inside my mouth, looks like it's not well prepared.<br/>
Nevertheless, I'm not going to throw them away like when I was in Japan.<br/>
I crammed the skewers into my mouth while ignoring the taste and pour unrefined sake I bought on the other stall down my throat.<br/>
<br/>
And then, next day--.<br/>
<br/>
I went back to the stall street to look for the stall that sold the fried rice yesterday, but I couldn't find any mosskin after all, his cousin stall that sold date palms was also nowhere to be found.<br/>
They probably belonged to some caravan troupes and were only doing side jobs yesterday.<br/>
<br/>
"I'm sure we'll meet again if fate allows."<br/>
<br/>
After muttering something I didn't believe myself, I joined the caravan I'd be riding on and left the town.<br/>
<br/>
"What's that, so pretty."<br/>
"Forget about it. That kid doesn't understand western countries language."<br/>
<br/>
I look back at the dark brown beauties who are riding the caravan together with me.<br/>
<br/>
"It's an Orb."<br/>
"Orb?"<br/>
"Oh? You can speak western countries language."<br/>
<br/>
One of the beauties said in admiration.<br/>
<br/>
The [Interpreter Earrings] I got yesterday appeared to be genuine.<br/>
Therefore, this Orb of [Appraisal] is also highly likely to be genuine.<br/>
<br/>
However, I feel that I'd be better off using the money I'd get from selling this kind of Orb.<br/>
This is troubling.<br/>
<br/>
"A Sand Pig is coming! Anyone who can use a bow, get ready!"<br/>
"Our turn~"<br/>
"You too come here! Pebbles vomited by a Sand Pig could easily break through a plank unless it's made of iron!!"<br/>
<br/>
I rolled behind the sand ship's iron plank while being hugged by a voluptuous beauty.<br/>
<br/>
"That thing's sturdy! Arrows from a small bow won't work on it."<br/>
"Just shoot! It'll work as a diversion."<br/>
<br/>
Diversion is fine huh.<br/>
<br/>
I don't wanna leave this lucky situation where I'm being hugged by beauty, but this situation seems dangerous if it keeps up.<br/>
I part myself from under the beauty's arm in grief.<br/>
<br/>
"H-hold on!"<br/>
"My shotgun is perfect as a diversion."<br/>
<br/>
I unwrapped the cloth hiding my gun and loaded it with some bullets.<br/>
<br/>
Aim at the Sand Pig swimming in the sand.<br/>
It won't reach at this range, though not like it'd be really damaging even if it did.<br/>
<br/>
But the roaring sound and the impact on the sand will be quite something, me think.<br/>
<br/>
I pull the trigger after narrowing down the timing on the shaking ship.<br/>
<br/>
--It hit?<br/>
<br/>
Looks like a lucky hit grazed the Sand Pig's eyes.<br/>
<br/>
"You're pretty good! I'm Miji, an archer and a dancer."<br/>
"Oh my my, Miji sure works fast. I'm Rouri, and you?"<br/>
<br/>
Eyes of two beauties filled with admiration are turned at me.<br/>
<br/>
"I'm John Smith. Just John Smith."<br/>
<br/>
I personally thought it was a cool self-introduction, but the two beauties didn't seem to get it.<br/>
If I find myself in the same situation next time, I should try calling myself an adventure lover.<br/>
<br/>
I extolled Miji's bravery, thanked Rouri's kindness when the Sand Pig appeared and presented them date palms from my knapsack.<br/>
Looks like sweets are justice even in another world.<br/>
<br/>
While I'm getting surrounded by smiling beauties, the sand ship we're riding on is en route to Garleon Union. <br/>
<br/>
Would it be tranquility or stormy drama waiting for me there.<br/>
The way to another world TUEEEE looks so distant and steep.<br/>
<TLN: TUEEEE is basically the Japanese version of OP.><br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<TLN: Author's note below.><br/>
The identity of the mosskin is unclear. Of course the identities of the catkin and the dogkin who came to get the mosskin are also unclear.<br/>
This is the first appearance of the try-your-luck stall keeper recommended by the mosskin. Whether he will appear again in the future or not is undecided.<br/>
