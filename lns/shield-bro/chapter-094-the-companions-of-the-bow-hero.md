<br/>
The names get somewhat confusing, Naofumi just calls the dude in the flashy armour "Armour" later on, similar to Trash and Bitch.<br/>
Being Companions to The Hero of The Bow<br/>
Morning the next day.<br/>
Naofumi:"Today I’ll be heading to Itsuki’s place."<br/>
Raphtalia:"……"<br/>
Raphtalia frowns slightly.<br/>
For something to already happen twice, I hope it isn’t going to happen a third time.<br/>
Since Itsuki has a strong sense of justice. He shouldn’t be doing the same thing as Motoyasu and Ren.<br/>
Naofumi:"Itsuki only cares about his sense of justice, so don’t worry too much. The other guys had their reasons. And it’s only for two days……"<br/>
Just to be sure, I caution her. I think they would be fighting around that neighborhood.<br/>
I’m not saying they should get along. I just hope that they can level normally.<br/>
Still, unlike Motoyasu and Ren, the bow can’t fight alone.<br/>
If I remember correctly, Itsuki’s vanguard was his companion with flashy armour.<br/>
Raphtalia:"O-Okay. I’ll do my best."<br/>
Firo:"Have a nice day master~"<br/>
After leaving the room, something pulled on my hair.<br/>
Shadow:"The Hero of the Spear-dono is taking a rest for today’s companion exchange degozaru."<br/>
Naofumi:"Did something happen?"<br/>
Shadow:"Treatment for Rokuru Fruit poisoning degozaru."<br/>
Naofumi:"That fruit huh–……"<br/>
Is it due to constitution? I had no problems with it at all.<br/>
It seems even in a separate world, I’m still as unaffected as I was in Japan.<br/>
Isn’t it a little strange that my body’s constitution didn’t change at all?<br/>
Or, maybe the one Motoyasu ate was just laced with poison.<br/>
Also……The reason I am fine might be due to the poison resistance granted from my shield.<br/>
Is Motoyasu going to be sleeping all day?<br/>
Since it’s that guy, there should be a delicious event of being nursed by various women.<br/>
His party structure is totally one from a Gal Game as well.<br/>
……I don’t doubt that he’ll rebound without trouble though.<br/>
Shadow:"Due to that, the exchange between Hero of the Sword-dono and Hero of the Spear-dono will just be for tomorrow degozaru."<br/>
Naofumi:"Hmph."<br/>
It’s just right for Motoyasu. As for Ren……There shouldn’t be any changes.<br/>
Well, it’s good for him since he won’t have to deal with Bitch and her party for another day.<br/>
Shadow:"I received a strange report saying that the Hero of the Shield-dono can really hold his alcohol degozaru."<br/>
Naofumi:"Those fruits were extremely delicious. Did you pay the bar for me?"<br/>
Shadow:"It was paid properly degozaru."<br/>
Naofumi:"Then it’s all good."<br/>
Shadow:"There is a rumour on the streets that you became the Hero of the Liquor you know degozaruyo."<br/>
I got attached to a strange rumour.<br/>
How can I be anything with alcohol if I can’t even get drunk.<br/>
Naofumi:"That’s not me. Stick that title to Motoyasu."<br/>
Shadow:"It has already been stuck to Hero of the Shield-dono degozaru. Rather, I am interested in why you are denying it degozaru."<br/>
Seriously……It’s gotta be one of those. Either the poison resistance keeps me from getting drunk, or the alcohol here doesn’t work on humans from my world.<br/>
Shadow:"You have arrived while we were talking degozaru. This is the room where the Hero of the Bow-dono’s companions are staying degozaru."<br/>
After saying so, Shadow’s figure disappears.<br/>
Naofumi:"Now then……"<br/>
I knock on the door to the room anxiously.<br/>
No Name:"Go ahead."<br/>
A normal reply came.<br/>
It seems Motoyasu’s place was the strange one.<br/>
The door opened from the inside.<br/>
No name:"Please come in. Hero of the Shield-san."<br/>
After entering the room, I see Itsuki’s companions all in relaxed positions.<br/>
Different from Motoyasu’s place where they were selfish, they are polite like Ren’s.<br/>
They are very relaxed as well.<br/>
However……Didn’t Motoyasu come earlier?<br/>
Naofumi:"I am Iwatani Naofumi, Hero of the Shield, I will be responsible for the last personnel exchange. We will be acting together for two days. Nice to meet you."<br/>
I confirm the number of companions Itsuki has while exchanging greetings.<br/>
Hmm……5 people huh? That guy wearing the armour is crossing his arms patronizingly.<br/>
I have a bad feeling about this.<br/>
However, when our eyes met, he stopped.<br/>
Armour:"Right, nice to meet you too. We are Itsuki-sama’s bodyguards, please watch us fight Hero of the Shield-san."<br/>
Bodyguards!<br/>
An amazing word just appeared.<br/>
Crap……I just laughed. What the hell is that guy doing.<br/>
I somehow suppress my smile.<br/>
Armour:"Indeed, we five are Itsuki-sama’s guards–"<br/>
Girl:"I’m sorry! I was asked to go buy something!"<br/>
The door behind me flew open and someone ran in.<br/>
When I turn around, I see a single girl carrying a tool bag on her back.<br/>
Girl:"Eh, Ah—-Hero of the Shield-sama has already arrived?"<br/>
I wonder how old she is……Should be around 14 years old? She gives off somewhat of a childish feeling.<br/>
She looks to be brought up well, and her genes look good. If it was Motoyasu, he would have hit on her.<br/>
She’s petite though. Doesn’t seem very suitable for combat to me. Does she fight by magic?<br/>
Though this voice is familiar.<br/>
If I’m not mistaken, she was the one that explained the Tzuvait ・Aura that I learnt.<br/>
You can’t really tell at a glance, but it seems she may be extremely knowledgable.<br/>
No Name:"Rishia is so slow! Hey, introduce yourself."<br/>
Rishia:"O-Okay!"<br/>
Armour:"The six of us are Itsuki-sama’s guards!"<br/>
Didn’t you just say there were 5 of you a while ago?<br/>
It seems one of them went shopping.<br/>
The atmosphere somehow feels disturbing…….<br/>
No Name:"Then, should we just go for now?"<br/>
Armour:"I guess so. We must receive teachings on our battling from the Hero of the Shield-san ."<br/>
Naofumi:"Ah, sure……"<br/>
I wonder. This tension.<br/>
I feel that I can’t keep up with it.<br/>
It seems there is no need to prepare anything, thanks to that girl going shopping earlier for all the necessary items.<br/>
As our party sets out, a feeling of anxiety remains.<br/>
When passing by the market, I witness a huge crowd gathering around the swindling merchant.<br/>
It seems he’s doing quite good.<br/>
We got on the ship for transportation but……<br/>
The ship is quite small for the seven of us.<br/>
Well, there isn’t any space to walk, but since it’s low-tide we should be fine.<br/>
The coral reef sure is beautiful……<br/>
No Name:"Rishia, move close to the edge more."<br/>
Rishia:"A-Anymore and I’ll fall over."<br/>
What is it.<br/>
Is the child-like Rishia’s position very weak……?<br/>
Before long, following a big wave a loud splash was heard.<br/>
Rishia:"GaboGabo……"<br/>
(Tlnote: I assume she is drowning, as I do not know proper drowning noises besides Glug Glug or something along those lines. I will be sticking with the Romaji. ガボガボ"<br/>
Sure enough, Rishia fell into the sea.<br/>
No Name:"She fell!"<br/>
I grasp Rishia’s child-like hand and pull her back on the ship.<br/>
Armour:"Seriously…..you are bothering the Hero of the Shield-san!"<br/>
Naofumi:"Nah, the reason she fell was cause of you guys."<br/>
Since the boat is narrow, there should be no problem for her small child-like stature.<br/>
Frankly, these other guys are taking up way too much space.<br/>
Naofumi:"Perhaps if you guys remove your armour and equipment, there would be more room."<br/>
That flashy armour is taking up the most space. What on earth is up with this guy.<br/>
Rishia:"It can’t be helped."<br/>
Naofumi:"What, can’t be helped……"<br/>
What is going on.<br/>
Anyway, I pass Rishia a towel so that she can wipe of her child-like body.<br/>
(Tlnote: Yes he is calling her small alot, I’m feeling a little creeped out as well.)<br/>
Rishia:"T-Thank you very much!"<br/>
Naofumi:"Make sure not to catch a cold."<br/>
Rishia:"O-Okay!"<br/>
She seems like a timid child.<br/>
The ship arrived at the island, and we got off.<br/>
This place seems to be full of hunting grounds<br/>
Seven people is a lot.<br/>
Naofumi:"Well then, the question now is, how do you guys usually fight with Itsuki?"<br/>
Armour:"Hero of the Shield-san. Can you do something about how you call Itsuki-sama?"<br/>
The guy who the flashy armour has an attitude and asks me.<br/>
This guy again?<br/>
Naofumi:"Wha?"<br/>
Armour:"Please, at least add some honorics when saying his name."<br/>
……What did you just say?<br/>
Whatever I call Itsuki is up to me to decide. To think someone wants to correct me and tell me to add honorifics?<br/>
It seems that they are extremely loyal.<br/>
Naofumi:"Let me warn you, I am the Hero of the Shield, and I will be treated the same as the other heroes. Why should I have to address him like that?"<br/>
Armour:"Incorrect, Hero of the Shield-san you are not as active as Itsuki-sama, therefore Hero of the Shield-san must show respect to Itsuki-sama."<br/>
What a complaint.<br/>
It’s an irrational argument. What this guy is getting at……When looking around I see that, excluding one person, everyone has the same opinion.<br/>
Furthermore, that one person is the child-like Rishia.<br/>
I don’t know what their real intentions are, but this is quite problematic.<br/>
Naofumi:"……What do you think you’re saying?"<br/>
In respect to activity……Since Itsuki is operating under cover all the time, wouldn’t his activities not be recognized?<br/>
He’s been going on a journey of social reforms, but there are barely any rumors.<br/>
Naofumi:"Activity? Isn’t Itsuki’s reputation as a hero the plainest? I haven’t heard anything about the Hero of the Bow’s activities anywhere."<br/>
Armour:"Bastard……You’re just a criminal."<br/>
In an instant, Shadow appears behind him with a dagger to his throat.<br/>
Shadow:"Hero of the Shield-dono is not guilty degozaru. By the authority of the queen, anyone ridiculing Hero of the Shield-dono will be punished accordingly degozaru."<br/>
Armour’s face is full of surprise from the sudden events.<br/>
Just like Bitch, his eyes are swimming.<br/>
He’s just being warned for slandering though.<br/>
Shadow:"Especially since denouncing Hero of the Shield-dono is a felony degozaru. The act of betraying a hero’s trust is something that must never be done degozaru."<br/>
It’s fine to think it, but don’t say it.<br/>
Oh well, did Itsuki’s companions not believe in my innocence yet?<br/>
Itsuki’s sense of justice is unusually strong. Did his narrow-mindedness infect his companions as well?<br/>
Armour:"Gu……"<br/>
Armour glares at me bitterly.<br/>
Naofumi:"Hey, I think this guy wants to return first."<br/>
Shadow:"Hero of the Shield-dono saying something like that is troublesome degozaruga."<br/>
Naofumi:"Well……"<br/>
It’s just one person not raising his level.<br/>
I think it would be better for our hunting as well.<br/>
It seems I have become a synonym for evil somehow.<br/>
This guy has probably been with Itsuki for too long, he has been brainwashed.<br/>
Shadow:"At any rate, I expect you to answer properly when asked degozaruyo!"<br/>
Armour:"Tch!"<br/>
After Shadow disappeared, Armour clicked his tongue in vexation.<br/>
Naofumi:"Hey, let’s talk for now."<br/>
Armour:"……When we fight, Itsuki-sama is always defending us from the rear."<br/>
Naofumi:"I see-……"<br/>
Well, he does fight with a bow after all.<br/>
Do the people in this world even understand the advantage of Long-ranged combat?<br/>
When anything life-threatening happens, Itsuki will always save them.<br/>
Though I think he’s only attack at long-distances when he gains favour, I’ll refrain from asking now.<br/>
Rishia:"L-Let’s just go defeat some demons for now!"<br/>
Rishia said aloud shyly, we began to talk one after another.<br/>
And then, we encounter a demon.<br/>
Armour jumps in front, and his companions follow him.<br/>
Armour:"Now! Hero of the Shield-san. Attack it."<br/>
Naofumi:"Why are you depending on me suddenly?"<br/>
Would Itsuki nock his bow here?……<br/>
Naofumi:"Use your head a little, think about my job."<br/>
Armour takes some damage from the demon’s attack to buy time for his companions.<br/>
Meanwhile, his companions are attacking the demon.<br/>
I get that they have co-operation, but with me here the strategy is wrong.<br/>
Naofumi:"You, stand back."<br/>
I tell Armour to get back, and I stand in front of the demon.<br/>
It’s still small fry. It’s not even itchy.<br/>
Armour:"Gu……"<br/>
Armour voices his vexation.<br/>
Are you envious at how calm I am?<br/>
I think you being able to use a weapon is even more enviable.<br/>
Naofumi:"And then, Itsuki would get the final attack with the bow."<br/>
Armour:"Right, even a little of his power does major damage."<br/>
Well……It’s just an average way of fighting.<br/>
However, it feels like these guys are a human wall.<br/>
No Name2:"Itsuki-sama has the most outstanding offensive power among us all. Our role is to maximize his power."<br/>
A different warrior in armour answers.<br/>
There is no reason to approach if he can attack from long-distance though.<br/>
In short, wouldn’t this make Itsuki have to be careful of friendly fire by mistake?<br/>
Rishia:"Afterwards, I assist in recovery."<br/>
Naofumi:"What about magic support?"<br/>
They can’t be just dealing with Itsuki alone.<br/>
Naofumi:"I guess I’ll do it if the occasion demands it."<br/>
Rishia:"M-Me too!"<br/>
Well, that’s about it.<br/>
Their co-operation with me isn’t the same as Ren’s part, but at least it works.<br/>
……Though the degree of co-operation from Ren’s party is unnecessary.<br/>
Naofumi:"Alright, since the defence can be taken care of by me, you guys in armour just focus on attacking."<br/>
Armour:"Can you take it all?"<br/>
Armour declares with a provoking feeling.<br/>
This guy again?<br/>
Does Armour have a grudge against me or something?<br/>
Naofumi:"Of course, I don’t have to act like I’m uninjured, unlike you."<br/>
There is no need to be cautious against small fry of this level.<br/>
In the first place, I could fully block the pope’s all out attack.<br/>
This guy was there too, so he should understand.<br/>
Armour:"Bastard……"<br/>
For some reason this guy in flashy armour has quite a lot of pride.<br/>
He complains whenever I do anything.<br/>
Though I say that, our hunt proceeded without problems……Not.<br/>
Random Adventurer:"You bastard! To kill-steal the demon that I knocked down! Your right to live is forfeit–"<br/>
Rishia:"Hii!?"<br/>
Armour dealt the finishing blow to a demon that a random adventurer was fighting.<br/>
No Name:"Don’t break the rules of the island! Our bad, This guy just had a slight misunderstanding."<br/>
Enough already, I just want to return soon!<br/>
This is as difficult as Motoyasu’s party.<br/>
The lecture on our first day here was completely forgotten about.<br/>
We were warned to never steal a kill on a demon that another adventurer is fighting.<br/>
This guy seems to be convinced that he is a special existence.<br/>
What the hell did Itsuki teach……<br/>
Naofumi:"My head feels heavy……"<br/>
And then, after fighting a while, I noticed that the child-like Rishia fights very clumsily.<br/>
When I think she would stab the enemy with a sword, she recites magic and casts recovery on someone who is injured.<br/>
Though, it was already too late.<br/>
It feels like she doesn’t have a grasp on her own role. I should pay close attention……<br/>
Armour:"Rishia, Move forward more!"<br/>
Armour:"Rishia, Fall back!"<br/>
Armour:"Rishia, Recovery. Hurry up!<br/>
Armour:"Rishia, Recite magic!"<br/>
Rishia:"O-Okay!"<br/>
I gave up thinking about it, since her bumbling about was always late.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
