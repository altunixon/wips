Exit by a Kick <br/>
  <br/>
 <br/>
The next morning, Raphtalia got up early today so we went to the barn together. <br/>
 <br/>
“Gua!”(Firo) <br/>
 <br/>
Firo happily rushed towards us as we arrived. <br/>
 <br/>
“Mou, the body is already grown up?”(Naofumi?) <br/>
 <br/>
Somehow…… compared to yesterday her head is bigger. It’s strange. <br/>
 <br/>
“Her body is almost balanced now.”(Naofumi) <br/>
“If you say so.”(Raphtalia) <br/>
 <br/>
Her appearance is similar to the other Philorials we saw in the castle town and on the highway. <br/>
Her colour now is white with some light pink mixed in. <br/>
It’s a beautiful colour. <br/>
That slave trader doing quite a good job. <br/>
 <br/>
“Are you hungry today?”(Naofumi) <br/>
“Gua?”(Firo) <br/>
 <br/>
Firo chirps while tilting her neck. <br/>
Yup. It seems the growing phase is over. <br/>
Biki…… <br/>
A strange sound is echoing. <br/>
Is this ok? <br/>
We finished breakfast and think of our plans. Meanwhile... <br/>
 <br/>
“Gua……”(Firo) <br/>
 <br/>
Firo stares at the wooden carts that entered the village enviously. <br/>
 <br/>
“So you want to pull one too?”(Naofumi?) <br/>
“I guess so.” (Raphtalia) <br/>
“How’re you doing Hero of the Shield-sama”(Villager) <br/>
 <br/>
The villager sees me pointing at the cart and come to chat with Raphtalia. <br/>
“Ah because my Philorial wanted to pull a cart, I'm wondering what to do.”(Naofumi) <br/>
“Ma….. It’s second nature for Philorials to pull carts.”(Villager) <br/>
 <br/>
The man nods as if convinced and starts inspecting Firo. <br/>
 <br/>
“Right now the village is in the middle of reconstruction so we have insufficient manpower. Hero-sama, can you help with distributing supplies in exchange for a cart?”(Villager) <br/>
“Hmm……”(Naofumi) <br/>
 <br/>
That’s not a bad idea. After all, I want to take advantage of the fact that I have a demon that is capable of these things. <br/>
I could also do other activities as the cart is being pulled. <br/>
 <br/>
“What do you need?”(Naofumi) <br/>
“I cut lumber in the nearby forest, can you bring it to the village for me?”(Villager) <br/>
“Forest huh……”(Naofumi) <br/>
 <br/>
That reminds me, I didn't check out that forest yet. <br/>
 <br/>
“It’ll take a while to return.”(Villager) <br/>
“Sure.”(Naofumi) <br/>
“Understood. Let’s discuss the details.”(Villager) <br/>
 <br/>
On the goodwill of the villagers, one cart was given to me. <br/>
Everything from the wheel to the stands was made of wood. Because it’s free, it can’t be helped that it’s old and of low quality. <br/>
 <br/>
“Gua♪”(Firo) <br/>
 <br/>
After the cart was prepared, Firo pulls it happily. <br/>
The villagers prepared reins for the carriage too, but it’s only for looks. <br/>
 <br/>
“Yosh! Let’s get to the forest today!”(Naofumi) <br/>
“Alright!”(Raphtalia) <br/>
“Gua---!”(Firo) <br/>
 <br/>
Firo cheerfully pulls the cart in the direction I pointed. <br/>
Goton Goton! <br/>
So relaxing…… <br/>
Goton Goton Goton! Garagaragaragaragara! <br/>
Wheels turn noisily as the scenery passes at high speeds. <br/>
“Faster! Faster! Slow down!”(Naofumi) <br/>
“Gua……”(Firo) <br/>
 <br/>
After slowing down, Firo walks with a Tokotoko sound while seemingly dissatisfied. <br/>
 <br/>
“Ugh…… I feel sick.”(Raphtalia) <br/>
 <br/>
Raphtalia has motion sickness and is lying down in the cart. <br/>
 <br/>
“Are you okay?”(Naofumi) <br/>
“Eeh……Don’t sway so much...” (Raphtalia) <br/>
“I see, Raphtalia you have motion sickness?”(Naofumi) <br/>
“It seems so. Are you okay Naofumi-Sama?’ (Raphtalia) <br/>
“I’m fine unless I get drunk...”(Naofumi) <br/>
 <br/>
It seems for me that liquor is related to motion sickness. I remember back in grade school, during a field trip on the bus, I was reading manga and light novels while the person next to me got sick. In the end, I had to ask for a seating change. <br/>
In additional, I remember on a family trip to meet relatives on boat, I was playing games while my family got seasickness. <br/>
 <br/>
“Mah... just relax, Firo will go slowly there.”(Naofumi) <br/>
“Please let me accept that kind offer.” (Raphtalia) <br/>
 <br/>
Raphtalia replies lifelessly as she lay on the cart. <br/>
 <br/>
 <br/>
On the way, I encountered someone I didn't want to. <br/>
 <br/>
“Buaha! What’s with that! Haha, Fuahahahahahah!”(Motoyasu) <br/>
 <br/>
This fellow holds his sides while he laughs out loud and the fucking woman behind him starts laughing too. <br/>
It feels disgusting to be laughed at. <br/>
 <br/>
“What do you want Motoyasu?”(Naofumi) <br/>
 <br/>
Motoyasu and the women who follow him all burst into laughter. <br/>
 <br/>
“Come on! You look ridiculous!(Motoyasu) <br/>
“How so?”(Naofumi) <br/>
“You’re so poor you began peddling? And that bird-----!”(Motoyasu) <br/>
 <br/>
Hmm……Peddling! That’s not a bad idea. <br/>
It seems Firo’s ability is more dependable. Let’s actually consider it. <br/>
 <br/>
 <br/>
“That's so stupid! That’s not a bird or a horse, and what’s with that colour, it’s not even pure white, there’s pink in there. And furthermore-!”(Motoyasu) <br/>
 <br/>
 <br/>
“What the hell is your problem?”(Naofumi) <br/>
 <br/>
I don’t understand why this bastard is laughing. <br/>
This is a waste of time. I should just ignore these guys and move on. <br/>
Motoyasu approached Firo when suddenly. <br/>
 <br/>
“Guaaaa!”(Firo) <br/>
 <br/>
Firo strongly kicks Motoyasu right in between the legs. <br/>
I saw it. <br/>
Motoyasu face that was laughing was distorted and was sent flying back about 5 meters while spinning around by the impact. <br/>
 <br/>
“U-ge……”(Motoyasu) <br/>
“Ky-Kyaaaaaaaaaaa! Motoyasu-Sama!”(Motoyasu’s companions) <br/>
 <br/>
Haha, I think his balls got crushed. <br/>
That was extremely refreshing. My investment for buying Firo was totally paid/worth just by seeing that. <br/>
As expected of my demon, it seems to have retaliated for me <br/>
I’ll buy you some good food tonight, Firo. <br/>
 <br/>
“Guaaaaaaaa!”(Firo) <br/>
 <br/>
While flapping her wings, Firo runs around noisily. <br/>
Motoyasu is now disregarded and forgotten about. <br/>
Iyaaa……That was great. I couldn't even see that scene in a dream. <br/>
 <br/>
“Wh-what’s going on?” (Raphtalia) <br/>
 <br/>
Raphtalia asks while getting up. <br/>
 <br/>
“Huh?? Ah, don't worry about it, it’s nothing.”(Naofumi) <br/>
“......You have a cheerful expression on your face that I have never seen before.” (Raphtalia) <br/>
Oh. It was reflected on my face? <br/>
But, that’s some amazing leg strength, to blow off the hero of the spear like that. <br/>
(Tl note: literally BTFO) <br/>
 <br/>
“Umm...... Please run slower.” (Raphtalia) <br/>
 <br/>
I couldn’t hear Raphtalia’s voice from the back as I let Firo run with a great feeling. <br/>
 <br/>
By the time we reached the forest, Raphtalia hit her limit. <br/>
 <br/>
“Uu......Uu......” (Raphtalia) <br/>
 <br/>
I reflected on going too far after seeing Raphtalia groaned and her pale face. <br/>
It's all Motoyasu's fault, because that fellow let me feel so refreshed. <br/>
 <br/>
“I’m sorry.”(Naofumi) <br/>
“Gua……”(Firo) <br/>
 <br/>
A disheartened Firo agrees apologetically. <br/>
 <br/>
“I'm, I'm alright……”(Raphtalia) <br/>
“You don’t look alright at all. You should be able to rest around here.”(Naofumi) <br/>
“Ah, it’s Hero of the Shield-Sama.”(Lumberjack) <br/>
 <br/>
There is a hut near the forest and a lumberjack villager comes out. <br/>
 <br/>
“Ah, so you came to get wood for the village.”(Lumberjack) <br/>
“Umm…… is that person ok?”(Lumberjack) <br/>
“I think so. Is there a good place we can rest?”(Naofumi) <br/>
“There’s a bed here, let’s put her there.”(Lumberjack) <br/>
 <br/>
The lumberjack guides us to the hut as I carry Raphtalia to the bed. <br/>
 <br/>
“Firo and I are going to fight enemies we can beat easily, while you pack the luggage.”(Naofumi) <br/>
 <br/>
Raphtalia is vulnerable to vehicles, let’s not use the cart for a while. <br/>
 <br/>
“Excuse me, I’m going to go put the wood in the cart. Come back in a few hours.”(Lumberjack) <br/>
“Ah ok.”(Naofumi) <br/>
 <br/>
Firo took off the cart and looked inside the cabin. <br/>
 <br/>
“Well then, let’s go.”(Naofumi) <br/>
“Gua!”(Firo) <br/>
 <br/>
With a kick that blew Motoyasu away, I expect great offensive power from Firo. <br/>
We went into the forest. <br/>
When we entered the forest, we did not encounter any demons. <br/>
We wandered around in the quiet forest. <br/>
In the forest, the atmosphere is clear and relaxing. <br/>
That reminds me, there are many sights that I have never seen before in this world. <br/>
I wonder why I never noticed it before. <br/>
It seems everything was blown off when I saw Motoyasu’s face warped in pain. <br/>
 <br/>
...No, it's something else. <br/>
 <br/>
I think it’s because Raphtalia believed in me. <br/>
Raphtalia isn't here right now due to motion sickness. <br/>
It’s somewhat lonely, even though we have only been together for about half a month. <br/>
 <br/>
“I should create some pills for motion sickness.”(Naofumi) <br/>
 <br/>
I look around and gather medical herbs. <br/>
 <br/>
“However, a demon may come out...” <br/>
 <br/>
Though we have been walking for a while, I haven’t seen any signs of demons. <br/>
 <br/>
“Gua”(Firo) <br/>
“Hm?”(Naofumi) <br/>
 <br/>
Firo's voice is heard in the distance. <br/>
I turned around and see Firo with something in her mouth. <br/>
……Is it my imagination? No, that’s an Usapiru. <br/>
It got swallowed immediately. <br/>
 <br/>
“Gua!”(Firo) <br/>
 <br/>
Firo runs to me as if nothing happened. <br/>
 <br/>
EXP 34 Acquired. <br/>
 <br/>
......I’ll stop worrying about demons. <br/>
After about an hour, we return to the hut. Our cart has already been fully loaded by the lumberjack. <br/>
Raphtalia is still asleep in the hut. <br/>
This is an evil idea. Raphtalia can’t last when Firo runs at full speed. But it is necessary to train Raphtalia who is not accustomed to the vehicle. <br/>
 <br/>
“It’s necessary to train with a cart for a while.”(Naofumi) <br/>
“U……Uu” (Raphtalia) <br/>
 <br/>
Raphtalia groans at my words. Did she hear it? <br/>
 <br/>
“Umm…… I have finished placing the wood.”(Lumberjack) <br/>
“Ahh. Then can you watch over her while I go to village immediately?”(Naofumi) <br/>
“ Yes! If it’s a companion of Hero of the Shield-sama, I’ll guard her with my life.”(Lumberjack) <br/>
 <br/>
Though I am slightly uneasy, I can’t just sit here and wait. <br/>
 <br/>
“Then I’ll be back soon.”(Naofumi) <br/>
 <br/>
I prepare the cart and depart with Firo. <br/>
 <br/>
“Guaaa!”(Firo) <br/>
 <br/>
Firo dashed energetically.
