<br/>
My translations are getting more literal… but I don’t have the creativeness, nor can I be bothered to reword it and make it flow better <br/>
Anyway~ the chapter we’ve all been waiting for, WELCOME BACK RAPHTALIA-CHAN!! ~^^~<br/>
Raising an Army<br/>
It’s been a few minutes after that.<br/>
As we were heading towards Ryuuto Village, we encountered people who appeared to be seeking refuge.<br/>
It seemed a soldier was keeping a lookout so everyone could evacuate smoothly.<br/>
"Ah, Hero of the Shield-sama!" (Soldier)<br/>
The soldier saw me and began to speak with a relieved expression.<br/>
"Let me just ask. What are you guys doing?" (Naofumi)<br/>
"We’re in the middle of evacuating citizens because of the violent revolutionaries in the Castle Town. We were able to rescue everyone safely, thanks to the Hero of the Spear-sama." (Soldier)<br/>
"I see. Now, let me release the brainwashing being caused by the revolutionaries in the Castle Town Plaza. I should probably also resolve this conflict personally." (Naofumi)<br/>
"I-is that so!" (Soldier)<br/>
Starting with the soldier, the refugees’ faces brightened at my words.<br/>
"Where’s the Queen?" (Naofumi)<br/>
"She has been directing the evacuation until just then, but she’s taking a break now." (Soldier)<br/>
And with that, the soldier pointed to a carriage residing near the refugees.<br/>
"Shall I call for her?" (Soldier)<br/>
"No, I’ll go directly so there’s no problem." (Naofumi)<br/>
I get off Firo and approach the carriage.<br/>
There, Raphtalia and the Old Hag, as well as Fohl and some of the slaves, were resting.<br/>
"Naofumi-sama!" (Raphtalia)<br/>
"Atla!" (Fohl)<br/>
Raphtalia rushed over joyfully while looking at my face.<br/>
Futhermore, Fohl was running over to Atla in the same manner.<br/>
Over there is, it’s inconsequential.<br/>
"It’s been a while." (Naofumi)<br/>
"Yeah… I really…missed you." (Raphtalia)<br/>
"Well, there’s a mountain of stuff to catch up on, but why are you guys here?" (Naofumi)<br/>
"Ah, right. We were coming to ask for Naofumi-sama’s permission to Class Up and were just passing by some meadows when we saw smoke rising from the castle unexpectedly, so we came rushing over in a hurry." (Raphtalia)<br/>
"That’s right. We never thought that we’d encounter such a strange situation." (Old Hag)<br/>
The Old Hag added.<br/>
You haven’t heard but…..<br/>
Honestly, I’m not good with this old woman.<br/>
"Atla! Atla~! Big bro missed you!" (Fohl)<br/>
"Hang on big brother, don’t come so close, please. Naofumi-sama is watching!" (Atla)<br/>
Atla pushed Fohl away, looking like she really disliked him rubbing their cheeks together.<br/>
I haven’t seen Fohl in a while but he’s grown somewhat.<br/>
Atla still seems like a child, but Fohl seems to be approaching adulthood already.<br/>
That’s the reality when comparing visually.<br/>
Compared to Atla who is around ten years old, Fohl is probably around 16 ~ 17 years.<br/>
Speaking of which, his looks are somewhat reminiscent of Trash….<br/>
It’s what the Queen said so it’s better not to worry about it.<br/>
"So the ones who helped the Queen were Raphtalia and your group?" (Naofumi)<br/>
"Yes. We rode in front of those who were trying to start a revolution." (Raphtalia)<br/>
"It’s Iwatani-sama…." (Queen)<br/>
While I was talking to Raphtalia, the door of the carriage opened and out came the Queen.<br/>
"Right now I’m learning about the situation." (Naofumi)<br/>
"Is that so. Shall I report as well then." (Queen)<br/>
"Where’s Trash?" (Naofumi)<br/>
The Queen silently points to within the carriage.<br/>
Trash was absentmindly loitering inside the carriage with an extremely complicated expression on his face.<br/>
"Our beloved daughter started the revolutionary. It should be alright for him to utter his complaints freely." (Queen)<br/>
"You also have it quite tough." (Naofumi)<br/>
"I did try to comfort him though?" (Queen)<br/>
Really? I can only see a disheartened couple-like relationship though.<br/>
I really don’t understand the relationship of these two.<br/>
"That sort of thing is fine. Tell me about the incident from start to end. I heard some of it from the unbrainwashed soldiers in the castle but…. it’s probably better for me to tell you the good news on my end first." (Naofumi)<br/>
I reported to the Queen about the unaccounted Itsuki, the castle soldiers’ tale, my land and the stronghold of the revolutionaries, and that Rishia became able to release the brainwashing.<br/>
I also spoke of the mysterious weapon obtained by my companion, Rishia.<br/>
I suspect that it’s most likely a Seven Star Weapon, but I wonder how it is really.<br/>
"Is this the Hero’s Weapon-like thing that came from the Hero of the Bow-sama’s Bow?" (Queen)<br/>
"Yeah, you can see it seems to belongs to the projectile weapon category." (Naofumi)<br/>
There were throwing knives and throwing axes, spear, slings, boomerangs, arrows, as well as shuriken.<br/>
To summarise the characteristics, there were a lot of projectile weapons.<br/>
There shouldn’t be any mistake.<br/>
"That’s strange. There should already be a Seven Star Projectile Hero but….." (Queen)<br/>
"What about them dying and the title becoming Rishia’s?" (Naofumi)<br/>
"Just like the existence of the Four Saint Heroes are known, the Seven Star Heroes also have their existence known so that shouldn’t be." (Queen)<br/>
"I see…" (Naofumi)<br/>
What kind of reasoning was that?<br/>
"Well let’s leave that decision for later. Tell me about the other thing." (Naofumi)<br/>
"Then―" (Queen)<br/>
The Queen talked about the events in the castle.<br/>
With Raphtalia supplementing some things in the middle.<br/>
A riot was caused in the Castle Town due to Justice Zombies, and Witch hoisted a flag in the plaza in front of the castle as a representative of the revolutionaries.<br/>
"I, Malty Melromarc, look down on Melromarc’s traditions and I pledge to overthrow the racist Queen Mirelia Q Melromarc for the sake of governing this country!" (Witch)<br/>
Witch raised her sword and declared loudly, as if there had been no change in her name.<br/>
Surrounding her were the remnants of the Three Hero Sect and the revolutionary nobles, and it seemed the brainwashed citizens were also drawn along.<br/>
""Yeah~!"" (Justice Zombies)<br/>
The Justice Zombies raised their voices in agreement with Witch’s declaration.<br/>
Apparently, the castle gates were closed for the time being and the Queen’s preparations for ambushing were progressing.<br/>
Dragon Knights tried penetrating the castle walls at times but it seemed counterattacks were made in time.<br/>
However, there were justice zombies inside the castle as well, and the preparations were at an inadequate level so the soldiers opened the castle gates.<br/>
"Go!" (Witch)<br/>
At Witch’s order, a suspicious robed person charges ahead and enters the castle.<br/>
Of course, this robed guy is one of my slaves who has been brainwashed.<br/>
As I expected, it seems that the plot that Witch thought of was a plan which involved marching into the castle and having one of the slaves I raised kill the Queen.<br/>
"Wait right there!" (Raphtalia)<br/>
Raphtalia’s party arrived to calmly clear away the Justice Zombies immediately afterwards.<br/>
"Just what are you doing!" (Raphtalia)<br/>
Raphtalia proclaimed with her sword pointing towards Witch.<br/>
"Oh? Well isn’t it the Demon King of the Shield’s right hand man?" (Witch) [T/N: Naofumi has been promoted from devil 悪魔 to demon king 魔王 XD]<br/>
Witch quietly scowled at Raphtalia and replied.<br/>
"That speech of yours really….. can’t be called a surprise. To cause such damage while conducting a revolution!" (Raphtalia)<br/>
Sensing the situation, Raphtalia glared back at Witch and proclaimed.<br/>
"Such damage? I am a victim. Of the spear-wielding imposter, of the sword-wielding imposter and…. well, let’s leave this to later." (Witch)<br/>
Witch probably thought of Raphtalia as a summer bug flying in the flames.<br/>
She laughed.<br/>
"So who is correct. Let us verify it here." (Witch)<br/>
Holding a strange dagger I have no recollection of in her free hand, Witch pointed her sword at Raphtalia.<br/>
"Two sword style…?" (Raphtalia)<br/>
"I’ll let you watch me personally reform the Right Hand of the Demon King of the Shield." (Witch)<br/>
Cheers broke out in the vicinity.<br/>
If she refused the match then everyone here will probably attack.<br/>
It doesn’t look to be an amount that can’t be handled but that suspicious dagger is on my mind, and I don’t understand why those in agreement with Witch are raging here either.<br/>
"…..I understand. Teacher and everyone else, please watch quietly." (Raphtalia)<br/>
Rather than using her power to settle the problem of being outnumbered, Raphtalia chooses to accept Witch’s proposal.<br/>
Witch is also an idiot~<br/>
Does she really think she can beat Raphtalia?<br/>
….Come to think of it, Witch and Raphtalia have fought once before.<br/>
Back then was before Raphtalia had her Class Up and Witch pushed through with the difference in levels.<br/>
Witch hasn’t seen Raphtalia since then and even with my sudden growth in strength, she probably doesn’t expect Raphtalia to have become as strong.<br/>
I wonder if she looked over the documents gathered by the revolutionaries and remnants of the Three Heroes Sect?<br/>
….Nah. Witch is only concerned with knowledge about using others, she wouldn’t think to make such calculations herself.<br/>
She probably intends to lure Raphtalia into a trap while calling it a 1 vs 1 battle this time as well.<br/>
Or rather, she intends to brainwash Raphtalia using the dagger.<br/>
She will win with if she gets a single hit in, so even if her ability is inferior, she can end it with one shot.<br/>
"Then as usual…" (Revolutionary noble)<br/>
A revolutionary noble raised his hand.<br/>
"Fight!" (Revolutionary noble)<br/>
He signalled the start of the match.<br/>
"Teryaaaaaaa!" (Witch)<br/>
Witch faced Raphtalia and brandished her sword with a large swing.<br/>
"Ha!" (Raphtalia)<br/>
With a small exchange, she stuck Witch’s abdomen with the hilt of her sword.<br/>
"Ugu―" (Witch)<br/>
"This is for luring Naofumi-sama into a trap." (Raphtalia) [T/N: Refers to Malty joining Naofumi’s party in the very beginning and then betraying him (stealing the chainmail and funds)]<br/>
Incidentally, she made a kick.<br/>
"This is for framing Naofumi-sama." (Raphtalia) [T/N: The false rape incident.]<br/>
And then she struck the top of Witch’s shoulder with the sword.<br/>
"Gyaaaa!" (Witch)<br/>
"And this is for instigating the 1-on-1 fight between the Hero of the Spear and Naofumi-sama and then using an underhanded trick in the end." (Raphtalia) [T/N: Refers to the fight after the banquet where Raphtalia’s slave status is revealed and Witch cheating with wind magic.]<br/>
She extracted the sword and this time cut at the legs.<br/>
"There’s still more to come. This is for putting a bounty on Naofumi-sama and trying to kill Melty-chan." (Raphtalia)<br/>
"Eep!" (Witch)<br/>
Witch inhaled, after undergoing a torturous barrage of attacks during which she couldn’t help but scream.<br/>
However, Raphtalia didn’t loosen her hand.<br/>
Well, she did cause a lot of severe hardships, even if it wasn’t to me.<br/>
