<br/>
"Is it okay here?" <br/>
"Yeah, that’s what Fuji-yan told me." (Makoto)<br/>
The grass-covered plains when coming out from the eastern gate of Makkaren.<br/>
I told Fuji-yan that I would be going to Laberintos, and he said strongly: "Then leave the transportation method to me!".<br/>
He told us to meet him at noon, so I am waiting together with Lucy, but there’s no sign of anyone coming.<br/>
"Did he mistake the time of departure?" (Lucy)<br/>
"There’s still 5 minutes till the appointed time, you know." (Makoto)<br/>
"But you know, if he is going to prepare a carriage for us, it would be weird for him to not be here a long time ago." (Lucy)<br/>
"Right." (Makoto)<br/>
I can’t see anything like that in this plains that has a good view.<br/>
"Well, Fuji-yan is a busy guy, so maybe he had some sudden urgent business—oh?" (Makoto)<br/>
"Huh?" (Lucy)<br/>
Our surroundings suddenly got dark.<br/>
Something big must have appeared above us.<br/>
"Eeeh?!" (Lucy)<br/>
Lucy raised her voice.<br/>
"…Wow." (Makoto)<br/>
It was a giant ship.<br/>
The big sail was fanned by the wind, and was pretty swelled. The white hull was bathing in the light of the sun and looked divine.<br/>
It was floating in the sky.<br/>
"A Flying Ship?!" (Lucy)<br/>
"Hey, Lucy, the ships in this world can fly, huh." (Makoto)<br/>
"They don’t. A Flying Ship is something that only royalties have…" (Lucy)<br/>
Lucy looks up dumbfounded.<br/>
Fuji-yan has something that only royalty has? <br/>
That’s crazy.<br/>
"Yahoooo!" <br/>
Someone jumped down from the ship?! <br/>
I was worried that they might break some bones, but that person landed nimbly.<br/>
So cool.<br/>
"Nina-san." (Makoto)<br/>
"Takatsuki-sama, Lucy-sama, we have come to get you." (Nina)<br/>
"Where’s Fuji-yan?" (Makoto)<br/>
"He is on-board—ah! Wait, that’s dangerous!" (Nina)<br/>
Even Fuji-yan jumped off?<br/>
But he didn’t land naturally like Nina-san, and he seemed to be using some sort of magic item to float his way down.<br/>
He lands.<br/>
"This is one majestic ship." (Makoto)<br/>
"Fufufu! Right? Right? I was thinking about surprising you, so I kept it a secret. Takki-dono and Lucy-dono are the first passengers-desu zo!" (Fujiwara)<br/>
"Wow! We can get to Laberintos with this, right?" (Lucy)<br/>
"I kinda feel bad. Having you do so much for us." (Makoto)<br/>
"What are you saying?! This ship is powered by the magic crystal that your friend giant gave me, Takki-dono! Without that, this Flying Ship wouldn’t have been finished-desu zo!" (Fujiwara)<br/>
"I see, so it is using that." (Makoto)<br/>
He has been busy recently, and it was because he was making this, huh.<br/>
While we were having a lively conversation, people were coming in droves from the city. <br/>
Well, of course it would stand out.<br/>
From within the people that gathered, an elegant woman came out from an expensive-looking carriage.<br/>
She approached Fuji-yan and greets him.<br/>
"Fujiwara-sama, congratulations for the completion of your Flying Ship." <br/>
"Oh! It is thanks to your help, Christiana-sama, that we were able to finish it. I promise to use this ship to bring further development to Makkaren." (Fujiwara)<br/>
"How reliable. Also, please call me Chris." (Chris)<br/>
"No no, that’s way too much of an honor for a merchant like me." (Fujiwara)<br/>
"What are you saying? Don’t speak like we are strangers." (Chris)<br/>
They seem to be having a conversation.<br/>
An acquaintance of Fuji-yan, huh.<br/>
"Hey, Lucy, who is the person talking to Fuji-yan?" (Makoto)<br/>
"Eh? You don’t know, Makoto?" (Lucy)<br/>
Lucy looks at me as if saying ‘is this guy serious?’.<br/>
You may tell me that, but I don’t know what I don’t know.<br/>
I can tell that she is a person of high class.<br/>
"She is the second daughter of Makkaren’s feudal lord, Christiana Makkaren. She is aiming for Goshujin-sama, a devious woman." (Nina)<br/>
Nina-san says this in a bad mood.<br/>
Hoh, the daughter of the feudal lord.<br/>
And Nina-san is clearly jealous.<br/>
"Fujiyan-san really is a person with a lot of connections!" (Lucy)<br/>
Lucy is impressed without a single notice.<br/>
"Goshujin-sama, isn’t it about time to depart?" (Nina)<br/>
Nina-san hurries.<br/>
"Ooh, right. Well then, Chris-sama, let’s continue our talk when I return." (Fujiwara)<br/>
"Yes, I am looking forward to your stories there." (Chris)<br/>
The daughter of the feudal lord holds the hand of Fuji-yan and smiles.<br/>
"Goshujin-sama~, let’s go." (Nina)<br/>
And Nina-san pulls his arm.<br/>
"Nina-san, I am leaving Fujiwara-sama in your care for the journey." (Chris)<br/>
At that moment, Chris-san speaks to Nina-san with a smile.<br/>
"Of course, I won’t let anyone put a finger on him." (Nina)<br/>
Nina-san smiles back at Chris-san.<br/>
""Fufufufu.""<br/>
At a glance, it looks like they are smiling in good faith.<br/>
I can’t see the face of Fuji-yan from here.<br/>
I wonder what kind of face this popular guy is making.<br/>
He has an isekai harem.<br/>
"Then, Lucy, let’s go." (Makoto)<br/>
"Yeah, I am looking forward to it!" (Lucy)<br/>
We boarded the flying ship.<br/>
◇◇<br/>
"Uwaa, so high~ so high~." <br/>
Lucy was at the tip of the ship and spreading her arms wide, receiving the wind onto her body.<br/>
Titanic? <br/>
Isn’t that dangerous?<br/>
"Lucy-sama! It is dangerous to stand so close to the edge." (Nina)<br/>
Nina-san really did come warn her.<br/>
I leaned on the handrail, enjoying this journey in the sky.<br/>
The wind feels nice.<br/>
"How does the ride feel, Takki-dono?" (Fujiwara)<br/>
"To think that you would get a flying way of transportation at the beginning city, that’s impressive." (Makoto)<br/>
"It would be unthinkable for a normal RPG game, right?" (Fujiwara)<br/>
Fuji-yan says this while chuckling.<br/>
But this is in reality the result of Fuji-yan’s hard work.<br/>
"By the way, who is driving this ship?" (Makoto)<br/>
"The sailor that I hired for this Flying Ship. There’s a winged beastkin there, right?" (Fujiwara)<br/>
There certainly is one with wings on her back.<br/>
By the way, they are all girls.<br/>
"No, it is just a coincidence-desu zo." (Fujiwara)<br/>
"Fuji-yan, lying isn’t good, you know." (Makoto)<br/>
"Well, I was the one who employed the women." (Fujiwara)<br/>
He easily spilled it.<br/>
"You really like girls huh, Fuji-yan. Even though you were so popular with Chris-san just now." (Makoto)<br/>
Even though we were dreading the fact that we had no luck with women in high school.<br/>
He has changed.<br/>
Fuji-yan made a rough expression.<br/>
"That’s the complicated part." (Fujiwara)<br/>
According to what Fuji-yan said, the feudal lord has 3 daughters, and the successor hasn’t been decided.<br/>
"Isn’t it normal for the eldest to succeed them?" (Makoto)<br/>
"It depends on the household. The feudal lord of Makkaren is apparently going to make the one who develops Makkaren the most into the successor." (Fujiwara)<br/>
"I see, and Chris-san wants to get some achievements, so she wants to get along with you, Fuji-yan." (Makoto)<br/>
"She is aiming for the fortune of Goshujin-sama! It is Goshujin-sama who is rumoured to have already amassed more of a fortune than the feudal lord!" (Nina)<br/>
Nina-san jumped into the conversation.<br/>
She must have been listening in on us with those long ears of hers.<br/>
Now that I think about it, Lucy and Nina-san have good ears, so I gotta take care of what I say.<br/>
"In this time’s making of the Flying Ship, it wasn’t only about making it, but we also had to secure a route, so we have to speak to the people who have the rights of those, or we wouldn’t be able to do business with it." (Fujiwara)<br/>
Fuji-yan scratches his head while explaining this to us.<br/>
"But thanks to all those pains with making the necessary arrangements, we were able to make reality the first Flying Passenger Ship of the continent!" (Nina)<br/>
Nina-san said this excitedly.<br/>
"However, we now owe a big debt to that woman…" (Nina)<br/>
"Nina-dono, you shouldn’t talk badly about our sponsor." (Fujiwara)<br/>
"You have it rough." (Makoto)<br/>
In both business and women.<br/>
"Hey, what’s the name of this ship?" (Lucy)<br/>
Lucy minced the topic of our conversation and asked this.<br/>
"Fufufu, well asked!" (Fujiwara)<br/>
Fuji-yan must have wanted to change the topic, he was totally into it.<br/>
"The name of this vessel is Saint Kanon! The white wings that travel through the skies of the continent-desu zo!" (Fujiwara)<br/>
"Heeh, that’s a lovely name!" (Lucy)<br/>
"As expected of Goshujin-sama!" (Nina)<br/>
Lucy and Nina-san praise him.<br/>
Saint Kanon, huh.<br/>
It is probably a name he took from the heroine of the Galge Game Fuji-yan liked, Saint Kanon.<br/>
While I was thinking that, Fuji-yan’s eyes met mine.<br/>
He was feeling a bit awkward there.<br/>
"That’s a nice name." (Makoto)<br/>
"Well, ain’t that okay?" (Fujiwara)<br/>
I really do think it is a good name.<br/>
"This ship doesn’t get attacked by monsters?" (Lucy)<br/>
"The reason we made the Flying Ship this size is because of that. It will be used as a Passenger Ship in the future, so there was the need to make rooms as well, but we made it in a size that not even wyverns and griffons can attack it." (Fujiwara)<br/>
I see.<br/>
"But what about dragons?" (Makoto) <br/>
The peak of monsters that are dragons don’t know fear, and they destroy everything, is what I have heard.<br/>
"We are avoiding the territory of dragons in our routes. We have casted defense magic to the whole ship, and we have combatants within the sailor wingedkin. If we get attacked by monsters, we can fight back." (Fujiwara)<br/>
"Ooh, you really thought it thoroughly." (Makoto)<br/>
I can rest at ease then.<br/>
"How long till we arrive at Laberintos?" (Lucy)<br/>
"Around one day. I think we will arrive tomorrow morning." (Fujiwara)<br/>
"Wow, it would take 1 week to arrive there from Makkaren by carriage." (Lucy)<br/>
"We can go in a straight line without any obstructions after all. It is natural-desu zo." (Fujiwara)<br/>
Fuji-yan says this proudly.<br/>
"Now then, I will show you guys around the ship! I have prepared a wonderful dinner for tonight." (Fujiwara)<br/>
"Yaaaay!" (Lucy)<br/>
Lucy was getting excited like a child.<br/>
Honestly speaking, I also want to act merry like her.<br/>
We enjoyed the short sky travel.<br/>
