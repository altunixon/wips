<br/>
Chapter delayed due to physical injury (not mine).<br/>
Anyways, the results of the Best Waifu are still coming in, but it seems Raphtalia is set to take first. Kookie and Atlas are in a close fight for second and third, with Kookie leading at the moment.<br/>
Here’s another.<br/>
Take Our Poll<br/>
Oh, and I just realized that Fohl is the reason for Kiel’s gender ambiguity. This makes me think the author will pair them later.<br/>
On a side note, Rafatalia is now Raphtalia. She isn’t fatal anymore (Pun not mine either)<br/>
Chapter 194: Dragon Sanctuary<br/>
"The problem is…" (Naofumi)<br/>
"What is it, Iwatani-dono?" (Female Knight)<br/>
"Will Ren go out of his way to target a lone dragon chick?" (Naofumi)<br/>
"Isn’t that the entire basis on which this plan is relying?" (Female Knight)<br/>
But he seems like the type of person to immediately pick a fight if he knows it’s an opponent he can beat.<br/>
Gaelion looks like a child. He’ll probably attack.<br/>
As long as Gaelion senses Ren, things will probably go fine.<br/>
As long as he pretends not to notice, he can launch a surprise attack.<br/>
If that sword is of the curse series, then the sin that would make him attack the lone Gaelion would probably be…<br/>
Gluttony… Ren may attack him to sate his desire for EXP.<br/>
He seems to like to have a high level, and Solo Players like him generally have such tendencies.<br/>
If those feelings of desire were to reach their peak, then he would definitely attack any lone enemy.<br/>
Another possibility is Greed… The fact that he’s become a bandit leader, and is collecting treasure may come from his desire for wealth.<br/>
I want to say that I have a monopoly on Greed, but I never unlocked that series.<br/>
It may be that each weapon has a different curse it can unlock.<br/>
Last is perhaps pride.<br/>
People who believe that level is everything, and look down on those of low level are common in Net Games.<br/>
Perhaps his lone wolf-like attitude is actually a form of conceit.<br/>
No, that’s probably Itsuki.<br/>
There’s also a possibility it’s of the older variant.<br/>
The 7 deadly sins have changed over the years. There were original 8.<br/>
Gluttony, Lust, Greed, Dejection, Wrath, Sloth, Ostentation, and Pride.<br/>
(TL: Ostentation is pretty much showing off. This list is from Evagrius Ponticus’ Logismoi (A.D. 4th Century). The version listed in the bible is once again a different one (Proverbs 6:16-19).)<br/>
Envy wasn’t present, and Dejection and Ostentation were in its place.<br/>
Eventually, Dejection was fused with Sloth, and Ostentation with Pride. Additionally, Envy was tacked on.<br/>
If it’s the old version, then Ostentation, devoting yourself to showing off your possessions to others, is possible.<br/>
In Online Games, strength is merely an illusion, but an individual’s attachment to such strength may be considered as such.<br/>
Of course, one can also gain true experiences and strengths through games as well.<br/>
In my former world, it was possible to find work with online connections. I had an online friend who asked me whether I wanted to work for them when I graduated college.<br/>
I had met him before in real life as well.<br/>
I’m not sure his true intentions, but he said something like, ‘Your upfront personality and Guild master Charisma are wanted in this company.’<br/>
Now that I think about it, perhaps he was merely praising me to make me work harder down the line.<br/>
But from Ren’s personality and relationships (lack thereof), it doesn’t seem likely that he’s had such an experience.<br/>
I can imagine him being a lone player going around and showing off the rare items he got off of a boss.<br/>
It’s not like he was the strongest, so having him brag over every little thing would just get annoying. As I guild master, that’s my opinion.<br/>
But there are plenty who find joy in doing as such, and that’s one of the very reasons for the profitability of the Net Game Industry.<br/>
Perhaps Ostentation is the one that fits Ren best. But Itsuki fits it as well.<br/>
The activation requirements for the Curse Series are still a mystery.<br/>
Perhaps it’s an explosion of emotions equivalent to the destruction of one’s heart?<br/>
But… If I don’t discover the specific triggers, I may be in trouble.<br/>
Greed is especially dangerous.<br/>
This is something I can understand well.<br/>
I have learned to control my Wrath, and I have companions to help me.<br/>
But Greed would make one covet wealth, right?<br/>
When I think of the pile of treasure behind me, a dark desire stirs in my heart.<br/>
And an unquenchable desire at that.<br/>
… I get the feeling that if I keep thinking about it, my mind will get corroded, so I switch my train of thought.<br/>
Anyways, the Curses that Ren is likely to have are Gluttony, Greed, Pride, and Ostentation.<br/>
Based on this, he will probably attack the lone Gaelion, as all of these sins deal with the gathering of EXP.<br/>
The problem is that he assaulted me, the Hero of the Shield.<br/>
Even if he beats me, I don’t think he’ll get much EXP.<br/>
And there are way too many risks involved in killing humans in this country.<br/>
"Ah, that’s right." (Naofumi)<br/>
I approach the bandits we tied up.<br/>
"When your leader fought, did anyone die?" (Naofumi)<br/>
"No, there were no deaths. He knocked them unconscious without dealing the finishing blow, and left them in the middle of a field after stripping them of their equipment." (Bandit)<br/>
"I see…" (Naofumi)<br/>
So he still has the conscience not to commit murder. Even though he tried to assassinate me from behind.<br/>
Perhaps he was thinking rationally, and first tried to weaken me, the one with the strongest defense.<br/>
From that train of thought, Gluttony is out.<br/>
The other possibilities are…<br/>
"Iwatani-dono!" (Female Knight)<br/>
My thoughts are interrupted as Female Knight calls out to me.<br/>
"What’s up?" (Naofumi)<br/>
"That!" (Female Knight)<br/>
Female Knight points outside the cave to the spout of fire streaming above the forest.<br/>
"So you found him?" (Naofumi)<br/>
That’s probably Gaelion’s signal.<br/>
I thought this would take a few days, but it seems Ren’s still close by.<br/>
… Transfer Sword has probably finished cooling down.<br/>
Even with the Curse Series eroding his mind, he’s thinking quite well.<br/>
He hasn’t lost his rationality.<br/>
"The problem is… we can’t help until the preparations are done." (Naofumi)<br/>
"Yeah." (Female Knight)<br/>
The idea Gaelion suggested required some time to set up.<br/>
If we approach before that, then Ren will simply run away.<br/>
No.<br/>
"Hey, can you use any concealment magic?" (Naofumi)<br/>
"I’m not Raphtalia. I never learned how to do it." (Female Knight)<br/>
"I see…" (Naofumi)<br/>
I thought we could Use Ren’s strategy and sneak up on him to unleash a powerful attack while he was distracted with Gaelion.<br/>
I never thought Raphtalia’s absence would be this irritating.<br/>
Taniko is skilled at some magics, but I don’t think she has any concealment magics.<br/>
… Wait, we have Rishia.<br/>
She’a a jack of all trades. She may have something.<br/>
"Rishia!" (Naofumi)<br/>
I exit the cave, and approach Taniko and Rishia. Both of them look troubled.<br/>
"W-what is it?" (Rishia)<br/>
"Can you use any concealment magics?" (Naofumi)<br/>
"I know some low level ones…" (Rishia)<br/>
"What sort of effects do they have?" (Naofumi)<br/>
"Um, the range is me, and one other person. The time limit is one minute." (Rishia)<br/>
That’s surprisingly low.<br/>
Even when she just knew the basics, Raphtalia was able to hide for quite some time.<br/>
"So it’s a different magic from Raphtalia?" (Naofumi)<br/>
"Raphtalia-san’s magic affinity is different, so…" (Rishia)<br/>
It seems that Tanukis specialize in light and dark magic.<br/>
Even though it’s a low rank, I guess it’s amazing that Rishia even knows it.<br/>
On top of Hengen Musou, she can use almost all types of magic.<br/>
I guess it’s fine.<br/>
"Then Me and Rishia will approach Ren and Gaelion to observe the situation. If the plan succeeds, I’ll call you so be prepared to come over." (Naofumi)<br/>
"Understood." (Female Knight)<br/>
"Will Gaelion be alright?" (Taniko)<br/>
Taniko looks worried.<br/>
"Yeah, he’ll be fine." (Naofumi)<br/>
Though he lost once, the current Gaelion is several times stronger than the other one, at least according to the older one.<br/>
I don’t think he’ll lose too easily.<br/>
It will be troublesome if Taniko rushes over in worry.<br/>
"Then, let’s go Rishia." (Naofumi)<br/>
"Yes!" (Rishia)<br/>
"Be prepared to come to our aide." (Naofumi)<br/>
"I shall also assist." (Atlas)<br/>
"Got it." (Naofumi)<br/>
I leave Atlas, Female Knight and Taniko, and depart with Rishia to observe Gaelion’s battle.<br/>
We reach what I think is just beyond the edge of Ren’s perception.<br/>
Keeping as low a profile as possible, we watch from the trees.<br/>
"GYAUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUU!" (Gaelion)<br/>
"Tei! Derya!" (Ren) (TL: Sound of putting effort into swinging a bladed object)<br/>
Ren and Gaelion are locked in a bout of fierce combat.<br/>
Gaelion is in his giant form. He avoids Ren’s attacks as he fires his breath. He’s putting up a good fight.<br/>
Ren is moving at quite a fast pace. His style probably relies mostly on speed.<br/>
Since I’m in charge of defense, I also focus on speed, and physical ability is a must. But people don’t seem to understand this.<br/>
Ah, I started complaining.<br/>
Well, if they can get past the shield, then there’s no real point.<br/>
Anyways, if we get any closer, Ren will probably notice us.<br/>
「Hide… Sword!」 (Ren)<br/>
Ren instantly disappears.<br/>
"Fool… Did you think such weak abilities would make me lose track of thee!?" (Gaelion)<br/>
Gaelion shouts out as he swings his tail at the area to his right which appeared to be empty space.<br/>
If I strain my eyes, I can see dust clouds rising as he steps.<br/>
There is also a trail of broken grass. Even from here, I can get an idea of his location.<br/>
It seems that Gaelion can sense him fully.<br/>
"Fueee… Gaelion-chan is speaking." (Rishia)<br/>
"Ah, so Rishia didn’t know either." (Naofumi)<br/>
I didn’t really tell anybody. And of course I keep it hidden in front of Taniko.<br/>
Raphtalia probably doesn’t know for the same reasons. I wonder how surprised she’ll be.<br/>
「Flashing Sword!」 (Ren)<br/>
"That again!? You really don’t learn!" (Gaelion)<br/>
Gaelion uses his claws to hide his face as Ren uses his skill.<br/>
The area is illuminated for a moment.<br/>
"You keep using small, superficial skills… What are you trying to accomplish?" (Gaelion)<br/>
「… Rakshasa Meteor Sword!」 (Ren)<br/>
Gaeloin twists his body to avoid the black projectiles coming out of the sword.<br/>
He’s putting up a really good fight.<br/>
Will he just win like this?<br/>
No, Ren will run when he is at a disadvantage. There must be a reason why he hasn’t run yet.<br/>
"There!" (Gaelion)<br/>
Gaelion unleashes his breath attack on Ren.<br/>
At that point, I clench my fist, thinking it was Gaelion’s victory.<br/>
But I was naïve.<br/>
Ren knocks away the Breath with his hand.<br/>
So an attack of that caliber isn’t going to do it.<br/>
Should I really be doing nothing and watching?<br/>
If I get closer, I’ll get in Gaelion’s way, and I may miss a chance.<br/>
Thinking back, it was quite good luck to have encountered him so quickly anyways.<br/>
If we let this opportunity get away, Ren probably won’t approach us carelessly again.<br/>
"I, Gaelion now order the heavens and the earth. Cut and fasten the knot of reason- " (Gaelion)<br/>
While battling, Gaelion continuously chants magic incantations.<br/>
"The Creation of my territory, the reason of my existence-" (Gaelion)<br/>
It seems he’s building up quite a spell.<br/>
Ren seems oblivious to this, as he continues to unleash his skills.<br/>
The previous Ren would have noticed by now… So the Curse Series does deplete one’s wisdom.<br/>
If he were a simple wild dragon with no fragment, I guess Gaelion would have fallen by now.<br/>
I don’t know what sort of expression he has under his mask, but I think Ren’s getting impatient.<br/>
Using his game knowledge, he must be thinking something like, ‘This species of dragon shouldn’t be anywhere near this tough.’<br/>
Even so…<br/>
"… Hey, Rishia." (Naofumi)<br/>
"What is it?" (Rishia)<br/>
"When you look at the Hero of the Sword’s stance, does anything come to mind?" (Naofumi)<br/>
"Let’s see… Is it some sort of style? His footwork is strange." (Rishia)<br/>
Is it something from Kendo? He’s using a shuffling movement, and I think I can see the Jodan Stance.<br/>
(TL: one of the stances of Kendo, I’m not really that familiar. http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/J%C5%8Ddan-no-kamae)<br/>
But am I imagining it? Something’s strange.<br/>
Recently, I’ve been sparring with Atlas and the castle soldiers so I can tell.<br/>
In a real battle, Kendo isn’t all that useful.<br/>
Of course, I can’t really tell you its shortcomings, but Ren’s swordsmanship and footwork seems a bit awkward.<br/>
He probably learned a bit of Kendo, and mixed in his own style.<br/>
Based on his age, he probably didn’t get that far in it, and he spent a lot of time on VRMMOs, so he probably didn’t devote too much time on it.<br/>
And so, after seeing masters such as Granny and Female Knight, his style seems a bit sloppy.<br/>
I look at Ren’s movements.<br/>
His strokes are full of confidence, but he isn’t putting his back into it, and he’s swinging his blade quite recklessly.<br/>
He’s relying on the abilities of the sword, and not displaying much of his own skill…<br/>
"Um, Female Knight-san can fight with much more elegance." (Rishia) (TL: Nicknames are spreading)<br/>
"Right." (Naofumi)<br/>
Female Knight’s straightforward personality can be seen in her blade, and she has no wasted movement.<br/>
I’ve seen her and Raphtalia cross blades before during training, so Ren’s swordsmanship looks childish.<br/>
Gaelion seems to have gotten a sense for it, and none of Ren’s attacks are hitting.<br/>
But I guess there’s no helping it.<br/>
Even if he’s a hero here, he was originally a civilian from peaceful Japan.<br/>
In this uncivilized world, Ren would have his share of troubles.<br/>
"And here, I proclaim the creation of my sanctuary. The dominion of a Dragon." (Gaelion)<br/>
"It seems it will be over soon. Rishia, let’s get closer." (Naofumi)<br/>
"Ah, yes!" (Rishia)<br/>
"I, who has understood the source of power commands. Let the truth once again be read forth and manifested. Hide our form from the world." (Rishia)<br/>
「Faust Hiding!」 (Rishia)<br/>
The magic calls forth a rain of leaves that wash over us, and cause us to become invisible.<br/>
The time limit was one minute, right?<br/>
We start running forward as soon as the magic finishes.<br/>
… As we’re running, I can see that we occasionally become semi-visible.<br/>
It seems that the quality is lower in comparison to Raphtalia’s.<br/>
"Mu!?" (Ren)<br/>
Damn. Ren noticed us.<br/>
「Transfer-」 (Ren)<br/>
"Too Late! 「Dragon Sanctuary!」" (Gaelion)<br/>
With Gaelion’s magic, a barrier like field is deployed around the area.<br/>
What is it specifically? I think as I look at it. Suddenly, I feel a light jolt on my skin. I get the feeling that something intangible just passed through my body.<br/>
「- Sword!」 (Ren)<br/>
Ren shouts out.<br/>
However…<br/>
"What!?" (Ren)<br/>
Ren’s words are colored with surprise.<br/>
Gaelion had used his experiences ‘til now… As a Wrath Dragon and an Emperor. He managed to make a skill that blocked off the use of teleportation.<br/>
"The game of tag ends here, Ren." (Naofumi)<br/>
<br/>
