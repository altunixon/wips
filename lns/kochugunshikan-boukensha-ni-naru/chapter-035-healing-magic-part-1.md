It was already close to evening when we got back to the inn. We took off our armors and had some tea in the dining area while waiting for dinner to come.<br/>
"Alan is really someone who breaks away from common sense. I have managed to realize that all over again from today’s events."<br/>
"Yes, you’re absolutely right, milady. I think most people would never believe what happened today unless they witness it with their own eyes. I now know why you say Goddess Ruminas has given Alan tremendous blessings, Ria-sama."<br/>
"What’s up with that, you two? You’re exaggerating things. I was just lucky it worked."<br/>
"Haa〜… Oh well. Anyway Alan, would it be fine if we had another round of magic practice tomorrow afternoon?"<br/>
"Well, I guess it’s fine. I have nothing particular to do at that time anyway. But wouldn’t it be better for you to learn some swordsmanship from Elna instead? My swordsmanship isn’t a legitimate swordsmanship style after all."<br/>
"No, I think your swordsmanship is much more suited for someone of my skills compared to the Divine Sword style I formerly learned. I felt that firmly when we took that swordsmanship evaluation test at the guild last time."<br/>
"Just how skilled is Alan with a sword, Ria-sama?"<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
"I have managed to witness Alan’s secret technique once. It was truly an overwhelming technique."<br/>
"Secret technique!?"<br/>
"Indeed. In fact, I would go as far as to say that Alan would be able to win even if he fought the Sword Saint. At least, he would be able to end it in a draw."<br/>
"T-The Sword Saint!? Something like that……"<br/>
"Sword Saint? You mean a person who has mastered the sword arts?"<br/>
"…Yes. The currently recognized Sword Saint today is the strongest swordsman of the Divine Sword school that I was a part of."<br/>
"Oi, oi. There’s no way I’d be able to match that kind of master, right?"<br/>
"I have managed to witness a practice match with the Sword Saint once. That’s why I can tell. Your swordsmanship won’t fall behind even when compared to the swordsmanship of the Sword Saint. More than that, I don’t think anyone who is facing your sword for the first time will be able to match you. ……Oh, right. Just what is the name of your swordsmanship style, Alan?"<br/>
What to do? I just casually named it Corinth Style swordsmanship in my youth. I can’t possibly blurt out such an embarrassing name.<br/>
"Uh, does it really matter?"<br/>
"Of course it does. I’m planning on learning your swordsmanship style in earnest you know. It would be strange if I didn’t know the name of my swordsmanship."<br/>
"Uh…… Corinth Style swordsmanship."<br/>
"Corinth Style… So that means you are someone who has developed his own personal style of swordsmanship, right?"<br/>
"Well, yeah. More or less."<br/>
Instead of saying it was the product of my wild fantasies during my impressionable youth, putting it like that would make so I take less mental damage.<br/>
"I see. As expected of one so talented."<br/>
Man, this is sooo embarrassing. I can’t look them in the face. Let’s just change the subject.<br/>
"Oh, by the way, about that request we submitted at the guild. There’s probably no results yet since it’s just been put up, but should one of us take a look later anyway? You know. Just in case. Actually, I think it would be best if one of us checks up on the status of the quest at least once per day. What do you girls think?"<br/>
"You’re right. Let’s check up the Guild each time we go out for magic practice or other business from now on."<br/>
"Yes, let’s do so. It would be great if someone’s already responded. Based on the distance between Cecilio kingdom and this country, it should be one month at least before they can get here, right? If they failed to notice the quest early, it could even take up to two months."<br/>
"In our group’s case, we kept on accepting quests while we were in the Cecilio kingdom in order to earn some travel funds as we searched for Ria-sama. The other groups are most likely doing the same. I don’t think it will take too long for some of them to notice."<br/>
"I see. It would be great if that were the case."<br/>
We had Verse’s cooking again for dinner for the first time in days since we came to their family’s inn. I and Elna ordered fish dishes while Cleria ordered meat. It may be his way of thanking us for being able to learn fried food recipes. The dishes felt more meticulously cooked and luxurious than usual.<br/>
The next morning, I found the two girls already having tea in the dining area when I got down from upstairs. It looks like they were waiting for me. We ordered breakfast from Verse afterward.<br/>
"So what are your plans for this morning, you two?"<br/>
"We are planning on having some sword practice in the yard of the inn today."<br/>
"I am looking forward to facing the swordsmanship Ria-sama learned from Alan."<br/>
Oh right. This inn had a small yard out front. It does sound better than carelessly running around within the city. There’s no guarantee there are no pursuers lurking around these parts after all.<br/>
Since it was near the lesson’s start time, I made way for the Magic Guild. I had plenty of leeway this time and didn’t need to walk in a hurry.<br/>
"Morning, Lily."<br/>
"Good morning. You came at the perfect time! It seems there was an injured patient brought in to the clinic earlier. You should be able to witness healing magic today."<br/>
Oh! I’m sorry for the injured person, but I’m still looking forward to seeing it!<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
The branch chief finally came outside from within the back room.<br/>
"Let’s head to the clinic right away."<br/>
The clinic was a ten-minute walk away from the Magic Guild. When we went inside, I saw several beds meant for patients lined up inside a clean-looking room. The patient was lying down on one bed and looked like he was suffering in pain. There was someone who looked like a doctor attending to him. There was also a young man inside, who seemed to be a nurse.<br/>
"Thank you for coming on such short notice, Cara-san. This is the injured patient."<br/>
The doctor stood up from the seat and made way for the branch chief.<br/>
"Oh, this is quite awful," the chief sighed.<br/>
It was the patient’s foot which seemed to be injured. One of his shins looked like it was broken, with bits of bone protruding out of the mangled flesh. It was a fairly serious-looking injury.<br/>
After examining the injury for a short while, the chief asked about the circumstances of the patient. It seems he fell down while descending some stairs, and the fall ended up being pretty bad.<br/>
"The way the bone fractured looks pretty clean. He should thank the Goddess for small mercies. How fortunate.<br/>
Now then Alan, in cases like this, it would be best to prioritize treating the bones first, because they are the ones that take time to heal.<br/>
First, we’ll have to properly set the bones to their former position."<br/>
As the chief explained, the male nurse made the patient bite onto a small rod and fastened the body of the patient firmly on the bed, along with the broken leg.<br/>
Before long, the broken leg was firmly secured on top of the bed.<br/>
As the nurse held down the broken leg, the doctor quickly pushed, making it so the bone was no longer protruding outside of the patient’s flesh.<br/>
The chief brought out the knife she prepared earlier and widened the wound where the bones were protruding from earlier. The patient kept stifling anguished screams during the whole process.<br/>
"This should do."<br/>
The chief finally got satisfied with the width of the wound’s opening and picked up a medical device used to hold the open wound in place.<br/>
"Alan, please pour some water from that pitcher over there on the patient’s wound little by little."<br/>
I followed her instructions. I washed away the blood from the wound little by little until the bones within finally came to view. The chief then began setting the bone properly while giving instructions to the doctor.<br/>
"This will be fine. Can you see the fracture clearly, Alan? We’ve managed to put it back in place properly now, right?"<br/>
It did seem like the bone was properly put back into place when I saw it while washing down the wound.<br/>
"We can finally use the Heal spell on him."<br/>
The chief closed her eyes and started concentrating. After about thirty seconds, she opened her eyes again and aimed her palm at the patient’s open wound.<br/>
"Heal!"<br/>
Rays of light came out of the chief’s palm and bathed the bones within the wound. When I zoomed in, I saw the gaps between the broken sections slowly starting to mend. Whoah! That’s amazing! It’s really healing it up.<br/>
"This should be fine. With this, we’ve successfully managed to mend the patient’s bones."<br/>
The doctor let go of the patient’s leg. It somehow resembled adhesive getting applied to reconnect the broken bones. The bones really were reconnected together.<br/>
"With this, the first session of healing magic is done. We’re going to use the Heal spell again after this. Are you fine with that?"<br/>
It looks like she’s asking the patient. The nurse finally removed the wooden rod from the patient’s mouth.<br/>
"P-Please go ahead."<br/>
The patient answered in the affirmative. Why did they need to ask the patient for confirmation just now?<br/>
The doctor removed the medical tool keeping the wound open and pushed both sides of the wound together afterward, closing it up. The chief closed her eyes and concentrated again. She opened her eyes before long and aimed her palm at the injury like before.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
"Heal!"<br/>
Rays of light came out of her palms once again and bathed the wound. After bathing the wound in light for a short while, the chief stopped casting the Heal spell.<br/>
"That should do it."<br/>
When the doctor released his grip on the patient’s wound, I saw that it had properly closed up. It looked about sixty to seventy percent healed.<br/>
"With this, the healing magic session is over."<br/>
It seems like the pain felt by the patient has finally subsided. He looks more relaxed now.<br/>
"Thank you very much," the patient softly uttered.<br/>
"Thank you very much for your help, Cara-san. Well then, we’ll continue the treatment from here."<br/>
The doctor started to take out medicine. He probably intends to clean and disinfect the wound with them.<br/>
"Let’s go back, Alan."<br/>
We got out of the clinic and made our way back to the guild building.<br/>
