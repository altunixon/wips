As expected of the trash king <br/>
Chapter 54 <br/>
 <br/>
Farewell <br/>
 <br/>
We returned to where the boss died to check up on those heroes who have fainted with volunteers and villagers. <br/>
So unnecessary..... <br/>
 <br/>
Well I had to return to get materials from the wave for my shield to abosrb, since the Assault Shadow Goblin and Shadow Lizardmen were only shadows they could not be absorbed. <br/>
No, I have a feeling that if i make a lump of shadows and compress it I should be able to absorb it. <br/>
 <br/>
Shadow Shield <br/>
Ability Unsealed......Equipment Bonus: Darkness Resistance (Small) <br/>
 <br/>
The other guys are omitted because the only equipment bonus they provided was for stats. <br/>
(Tl note: It's not because I'm lazy he just says 他の奴等は全部ステータスアップ系の装備ボーナスしかないので省略する。) <br/>
The big ghost-like fish that the other Heroes defeated is quite desirable. <br/>
 <br/>
"Aan~" <br/>
"Don't eat it." <br/>
 <br/>
Because Firo was about to eat the head I ordered her to stop. <br/>
As for why this bird went berserk, the cause is still unknown. <br/>
My speculation is that it should be due to the dragon core that this fellow carelessly ate. <br/>
 <br/>
"But......" <br/>
 <br/>
When I was about to pick it up my hand fell through and onto the ground, it was quite surprising. <br/>
 <br/>
"How did you pick it up?" <br/>
"I used wind magic on my hand" <br/>
"Hah......" <br/>
 <br/>
I can't even touch it barehanded,this sure is quite the strange fish.  <br/>
I asked the volunteer soldiers to bring the other heroes here, It seems their exclusive weapons are necessary. <br/>
Since one of them possess a weapon with a cheap attribute that is useful, I'll have to borrow it. <br/>
According to Firo, the item itself has to have magic imbued. <br/>
My shield absorbs a part of the head. <br/>
 <br/>
Soul Eater Shield <br/>
Ability Unsealed......Equipment Bonus: Skill "Second Shield"  Soul Resistance (Intermediate) Mind Attack Resistance (Intermediate) SP Up <br/>
Special effect: Soul Devour Sp recovery (Weak) <br/>
 <br/>
Even though the demon head was dismantled the name did not disappear so it doesn't really matter. <br/>
I absorb another part but there is no change either. <br/>
However, I am curious as to what the Second Shield skill does. As for soul resistance......It is probably resistance against attacks of this type. <br/>
the name Soul Devour makes me slightly anxious. It seems I can eat souls; it's quite unpleasant. <br/>
The shape of my shield changes slowly. The design seemed to be based off of this demon's head since it is attached to my shield. <br/>
...... It's defence is greater than the Chimeric Viper Shield. <br/>
It seems Soul Devour is a skill that is exclusive to this shield. <br/>
 <br/>
So I reach out my hand. <br/>
When I do so I am unable to touch the flesh of the soul eater. <br/>
But it still feels different somehow.	 <br/>
Good. <br/>
I don't want anything that will consume souls, I don't have such a hobby. <br/>
It's probably a counter effect. It will probably just absorb the enemy's SP. <br/>
Now then, what will the skill Second Shield do? <br/>
I'll experiment. <br/>
 <br/>
"Second Shield!" <br/>
 <br/>
Air Strike Shield -> Second Shield <br/>
 <br/>
An icon appears. <br/>
 <br/>
"Air Strike Shield!" <br/>
 <br/>
After I confirm the Air Strike Shield appearing I once again call out <br/>
 <br/>
"Second Shield!" <br/>
 <br/>
......Another shield appears. <br/>
I see. It seems I'll be able to add another shield on top of Air Strike Shield within it's effect duration. <br/>
This will have various uses, but the performance of the second shield may be different. <br/>
 <br/>
I pay more attention to the remains of the Soul Eater. <br/>
 <br/>
"I want to absorb the rest, but then those annoying fellows won't shut up about it...... <br/>
 <br/>
They probably won't shut up. <br/>
This is troubling since there are beings stronger than the heroes who are already the strongest in this world. <br/>
If those three are this weak, even if I become strong I won't be able to take it easy. <br/>
Sigh...... Should I just leave? <br/>
 <br/>
"Master, can Firo have the rest?" <br/>
 <br/>
The bird is slobbering everywhere while being noisy. <br/>
 <br/>
"Can't be helped......" <br/>
 <br/>
I cut the area from the back bone to the tail and give it to Firo. <br/>
Who ate it it one gulp. <br/>
 <br/>
"This texture is like a slime~" <br/>
"Wait a minute bird. When did we encounter slimes?" <br/>
"Uhmm you see~" <br/>
 <br/>
I'll omit the details and abbreviate. <br/>
As a result I was angry. <br/>
In the meaning that I didn't get to absorb any by my shield. <br/>
 <br/>
"Alright, let's help out with the reconstruction of the village." <br/>
 <br/>
Along with the volunteers we started helping out around the village, by processing demon corpses and reconstructing any damaged buildings. <br/>
Still, I cannot help everyone. So my top priority became making meals and treating injuries. <br/>
 <br/>
"Okay!" <br/>
 <br/>
The volunteers obediently did what I asked without question. <br/>
It seems I don't need to doubt them anymore. <br/>
One night passed after the long fight, it seems the knights have finally arrived. <br/>
Along with the volunteers I was summoned by an angry knight leader. <br/>
 <br/>
"Bastard! who gave you permission to selfishly take my soldiers!" <br/>
"This isn't the Hero-sama's responsibility! we were the ones who wanted to help and borrow his power." <br/>
"What? You lot call yourselves knights of Merlot Mark? By siding with the shield bastard?" <br/>
"You know...... this is quite the disgrace scene, if you have a problem with our behaviour just get rid of us right?" <br/>
 <br/>
The volunteers protected my by frankly expressing their opinions. <br/>
According to the stories I head, the upper echelon of the knights had a meeting after they found out that the volunteers wanted to help a Hero. <br/>
 <br/>
"I think that if these guys weren't here there would be much more damage." <br/>
 <br/>
the villagers who heard what I said also nod. <br/>
 <br/>
"The other heroes and their companions were brought to that building to rest after they were defeated by the formidable enemy who appeared during the wave." <br/>
 <br/>
Though they weren't asked to the villagers take care of the Heroes and their companions. <br/>
Thanks to the prescribed medicine, they will have a complete recovery in a few days. <br/>
Due to the fast recovery they regained consciousness today. <br/>
 <br/>
"Hurry up carry out Hero-sama and their companions, send them to the Treatment Institute Immediately!" <br/>
"Hey...... They are going to be fine. Priority goes to the villagers and others who are severely injured." <br/>
"The Heroes are our top Priority, For this world and our country." <br/>
 <br/>
What an arrogant answer...... <br/>
Well, it seems their problem is that I prioritized the treatment of villagers. <br/>
 <br/>
"Whatever. Go away, I'm busy." <br/>
"Wait, Shield" <br/>
 <br/>
The knight leader calls for my to stop, so I turn around and ask for the circumstances. <br/>
 <br/>
"What is it this time......" <br/>
"You need to give a report, so come to the castle." <br/>
"No thanks, that place stinks." <br/>
"I'm telling you to come!" <br/>
 <br/>
Do you have the authority? Even though this is meaningless why does it still have to be prioritized. <br/>
The volunteers lower their heads and look down, but I just ignore it and turn around. <br/>
 <br/>
"Hero of the Shield-sama I beg you, please go......" <br/>
 <br/>
......Oh, this guy obeyed my instructions and acted properly. <br/>
I cannot coldly refuse,though it is also necessary to go collect my metal wagon from the old man. <br/>
 <br/>
"Hah......" <br/>
 <br/>
I look back while scratching my head. <br/>
 <br/>
"Fine. I'll go. But I'll only meet this guy once." <br/>
"Thank you very much!" <br/>
 <br/>
I nodded to the volunteer who expressed his thanks. <br/>
This, we went straight to the castle. <br/>
 <br/>
Next day. <br/>
We arrive at the castle town and enter the castle. <br/>
 <br/>
"The shield's companions have to wait in another room." <br/>
"Why am I the only one that goes?" <br/>
 <br/>
Why is this guy acting so overbearing? <br/>
 <br/>
"Hey, can I leave yet?" <br/>
 <br/>
This is going to be a giant waste of time. <br/>
 <br/>
"Please don't go. There are various things that you must hear." <br/>
"I would have liked to talk about them before coming here." <br/>
 <br/>
The process of how the other heroes got smashed and how we defeated the enemy was already explained. <br/>
It seems one of the volunteers confirmed what I said since he happened to see it. <br/>
In any case, if the trash king tries to force something on me I'll just run away. <br/>
Due to Raphtalia and Firo I will not be easily caught. <br/>
 <br/>
"Quiet! You are in the King's presence!" <br/>
 <br/>
I was guided to the throne and the trash king greeted me with a grim expression. <br/>
It seems he already heard the story. He seems to be irritated. <br/>
 <br/>
"Although it is regrettable, thanks to the shield the wave was defeated. Though I don't believe it." <br/>
"Is that any way to thank a person?" <br/>
"Insolence!......Well, it's fine.  I only want to ask one thing. Though I'm sure you're lying." <br/>
"......What do you want" <br/>
 <br/>
It is a little annoying that he believes everything I say to be false. <br/>
 <br/>
"Shield, how did you outwit the other heroes and steal their strength? You have an obligation to speak, though I don't believe it. Now speak. Though I know you're lying." <br/>
 <br/>
......So it's about that. The trash king is concerned that the other heroes are weaker than me. <br/>
Hah. I am so disgusted that I can't even talk. <br/>
Honestly, Glass beat the other heroes up. <br/>
Even though the Heroes outnumbered her they still lost. <br/>
Did I only win due to compatibility and the fact that the other party was worn out? Or were the other heroes weak and not even exhaust her. <br/>
I should look around that vicinity when I'm free. <br/>
But, what to do here. <br/>
Alright. <br/>
I showed a radiant smile to the trash and gave him a thumbs down. <br/>
"Prostrate yourself if you want to find out." <br/>
"What?" <br/>
 <br/>
All that's on the trash king's face is a dumbfounded expression. <br/>
that's a very interesting face. I want a picture. <br/>
 <br/>
"Did you not hear me? It seems trash has poor hearing. I told you to rub your head on the ground if you want to know." <br/>
"Yo-Yo-Yo" <br/>
"What's wrong? You sound like a screeching monkey. Oh I see, the trash king of this country is indeed lower than a monkey. Though I would rather be talking to a monkey." <br/>
 <br/>
The trash king's face is instantly dyed-red, and stares at me like I'm responsible for the murder of his parents. <br/>
Ah, this feels pretty good. <br/>
 <br/>
"You bastard----------------------!" <br/>
 <br/>
The cry of the trash king echoes throughout the castle. <br/>
 <br/>
Enemy from the wave in front, and trash king in the back. <br/>
But, I do not intend to be defeated by either. <br/>
 <br/>
And in this way I parted with the trash king.
