Intermission: Zena<br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
The invoked magic wraps my body.<br/>
<br/>
Even though it's a sensation that I'm familiar with, right now it's irritating.<br/>
<br/>
To confirm the effect I take a step forward. <br/>
<br/>
Okay, it is working properly. <br/>
<br/>
Together with the wind.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
I am running.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
◇<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
I met that person yesterday. Even though it has not been even a full day yet since then, I feel like it has been longer than that.<br/>
I thought that I could defend the demon's attack with my magic, but my body became battered instead. My feet and arms were throbbing in pain, I was like a doll, unable to move.<br/>
I slightly turn my neck.<br/>
<TLN: Yes, we have entered her reminiscence><br/>
<br/>
Fortunately, before I slammed into the ground, I was caught in roadside tree's branches somewhere.<br/>
<br/>
...Fortunately? Is it really so?<br/>
My life force is going to disappear first before that overly strong demon could be defeated and for someone from the army to find me.<br/>
<br/>
Even now, my blood is dripping out little by little.<br/>
<br/>
My consciousness is fading but I come back to myself when I hear someone's footsteps. I muster all of the little energy I have left, and turn my sight.<br/>
That someone is wearing a robe so gaudy it's hurting your eyes.<br/>
I, who was on the brink of death, still think how out of place it looks in daily life. <br/>
<br/>
I want to go back to (that) daily life too!<br/>
<br/>
Even though I feel exhausted looking at that gaudy robe, I call out for him before he's gone.  He has a voice that feels like he's going to be carefree wherever he is.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
◇<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Running.<br/>
<br/>
Avoiding people, avoiding wagon, I am running.<br/>
<br/>
Ahead, even a step.<br/>
<br/>
Faster, even a moment.<br/>
<br/>
I am running.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
◇<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
I wonder if I blacked out, after calling him out, he immediately stands beside me.<br/>
<br/>
It's a very calm-looking boy which you wouldn't think would wear that gaudy robe.<br/>
I wouldn't call him handsome, but he's someone who's giving you a favorable impression.<br/>
<br/>
After ascertaining my wounds and dealing with my fractures, he gently, yes, very gently lifts me up to his arms.<br/>
<br/>
His robe, which looks really new, is dirtied by my blood and dust.<br/>
But he doesn't seem to mind those kind of things at all.<br/>
<br/>
Despite his delicate appearance, he has enough power to carry me without looking strained.<br/>
<br/>
I wonder how will he bring me down from the tree?<br/>
With magic?<br/>
<br/>
Contrary to my expectation, he flies from the branches without even using magic.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
◇<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
I run through the alley.<br/>
<br/>
Without killing my momentum, I kick the wall to turn at the corner.<br/>
<br/>
I avoid people who are surprised like I'm dancing.<br/>
<br/>
I don't even mind my skirt fluttering around.<br/>
<br/>
I run using every ounce of my strength.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
◇<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
I close my eyes in order to endure the soon-to-come impact.<br/>
I hear someone screams annoyingly close to my ears, but it was my own voice.<br/>
<br/>
However the shock never came no matter how long I wait.<br/>
When I timidly open my eyes, with worried visage, he tenderly greets me.<br/>
<br/>
He doesn't seem to directly go down below but jumps over a series of branches and go up the roof.<br/>
What a nimble person!<br/>
<br/>
Let's call him Nimble-san from now on.<br/>
<br/>
While carrying me, he's ferrying across several roofs, looking for a place to go down.<br/>
He was jumping up and down several times, but he was doing it like a weightless feather. As if he has wings.<br/>
<br/>
I wonder if this is what it feels like to be flying in the sky?<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
◇<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
I am losing breath.<br/>
<br/>
But I can't stop now.<br/>
<br/>
I was entrusted to call for reinforcement, for the sake of not letting him die.<br/>
<br/>
I am ignoring the scream of my body.<br/>
<br/>
I will let it rest however much later.<br/>
<br/>
Right now I must be faster, even one step.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
◇<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
When we're going through a cramped house, he's being very careful as to not make my fractured limbs touch the furnitures.<br/>
<br/>
I feel like a princess after receiving this much of careful attentions.<br/>
A luxurious thing, considering I had readied myself to die just before.<br/>
<br/>
Whenever he avoids the furnitures, our bodies are getting in close contacts.<br/>
I've done training with male coworkers before, but he has no beast-like body odors unlike those men. On the contrary, I can faintly smell elegant-like fragrance.<br/>
His hair is smooth too. I want to touch that for a bit...<br/>
<br/>
The fight has ended in the plaza. Apparently they won.<br/>
I am led by him to receive the medical treatment.<br/>
<br/>
He hands me over to the relief station after the treatment is finished, and goes to rescue other people.<br/>
During our parting, he turns around and waves at me once.<br/>
I don't know if that was for me, but I feel a bit happy.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
◇<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
It's almost the central main street.<br/>
<br/>
A child suddenly jumps out from the sideway.<br/>
<br/>
I cannot avoid him as it is. I jump over the child, performing a somersault in the air.<br/>
<br/>
I know it's shameless since I'm wearing a skirt, but now it's not the time to be concerned about it.<br/>
<br/>
I leave the child's safety to the adults nearby.<br/>
<br/>
Imposing my feet with unreasonableness for the last time.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
◇<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
On the evening of that day, Lilio and my friends made fun of me when they saw me talking with Nimble-san "Spring finally comes to Zena huh~", they said.<br/>
I don't understand love even if you tell me.<br/>
Whenever I'm thinking about him, I somehow feel like running in a lap.<br/>
If this is really love then I can understand why Lilio, who's a love-maniac, is fast to react.<br/>
<br/>
The next day, I somehow go out with a skirt. There is no particular reason.<br/>
Before I go to the temple for treatment, I wonder if I can meet him I go to the bookstore he helped yesterday? I consider that for a bit... This small thought is a secret.<br/>
<br/>
When I really meet him on the bookstore, I feel that this is a fate for a moment.<br/>
Am I exaggerating?<br/>
Lilio will surely make fun of it, "Children really do like fates eh~", no doubt about it.<br/>
<br/>
He tells me that my unfashionable clothes is "Lovely".<br/>
Let's not forget to write the diary when I go home today!<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
◇<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
I jump into the central street while rolling.<br/>
<br/>
Running on the street, I'm passing through carriages while grazing them.<br/>
<br/>
I will apologize to the coachman who let out abusive languages later.<br/>
<br/>
Waiting for my breath to catch up is vexing so I recite the wind magic, Whisper Wind.<br/>
There should gatekeeper inside the inner wall.<br/>
<br/>
"This is magic soldier Zena speaking! On the east district, purple has appeared on the 13th square near the outer wall."<br/>
"Are you using magic? I'm Mondo of the gatekeeper guard unit. Are you certain that it's purple?"<br/>
<br/>
Purple is military term for demon.<br/>
We can't exactly shout demon appears in broad daylight.<br/>
<br/>
"There is no mistake, I've confirmed it visually. Please send reinforcements ASAP. I will go back there to help evacuate the civilians."<br/>
"W, wait, alone"<br/>
<br/>
Without listening to Mondo-san's last words, I'm going back to the square where Satou-san is.<br/>
In the middle of the way, roars and building breaking come from the direction of the square.<br/>
<br/>
My heart tightens, imagining the worst.<br/>
<br/>
It's okay! I persuade my mind.<br/>
Nebiren-sama from Garleon temple is there, he is the best holy magic practitioner in this Seryu city. If it's him, even if he can't defeat the higher-demon, he should be able to buy time.<br/>
<br/>
I recast Wind Walk which had its effect expired.<br/>
<br/>
I reaffirm my trembling legs.<br/>
<br/>
To run again.<br/>
<br/>
Going back to that person's side.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
◇<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
I was given a flower as present.<br/>
A small winter honey flower which has a gentle fragrance.<br/>
I wonder if he knows the meaning in flower language?<br/>
<br/>
We went around the shops Lilio taught me. He is exaggeratively surprised on even the most ordinary things I show him.<br/>
It's kind of fun.<br/>
<br/>
The trump card that I reserved from the the thing Lilio taught me was a misfire, it's a bit shame, but before I know it our hands are joined while we walk together.<br/>
The crowds which I always complain in my mind, only for today, I'm grateful to them.<br/>
<br/>
Isn't this what they call a date?<br/>
<br/>
The flower language was "Love which begins to sprout".、If only he knew about it.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
◇<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
I arrive at the square sooner than I expected.<br/>
<br/>
But I don't have time to wonder.<br/>
<br/>
Because, there is only a vacant lot over there...<br/>
In despair, I collapse to the ground.<br/>
<br/>
On the center of the lot, an ominous black rock grown with sharp thorn stood. I hear voices from that black rock.<br/>
I drag my over abused legs as if it's screaming in protest there. <br/>
<br/>
If I'm not mistaken, the demon said something about [Labyrinth].<br/>
I don't understand the connection between demon and labyrinth, but Satou-san and the others might be inside.<br/>
<br/>
I was going to jump inside even by myself.<br/>
But, I was stopped at the entrance of the black rock. By the commanders who came by riding horses. They seemed to have been in the inner wall when I contacted it earlier.<br/>
<br/>
I was appointed to be a temporary liaison by the commander, to help in securing the square during the construction of military post.<br/>
Since I'm near the commander, I get a hold of various informations. The open space and houses surrounding the square seems to have been sucked into the ground. Alongside with the people.<br/>
<br/>
I'm sure the nimble Satou-san should be able to take refuge in a safe place somewhere. Let's believe that now.<br/>
<br/>
The consul-sama who came after the military post is complete, looks unusually excited while saying something about the Labyrinth Nucleus (Dungeon Core), but I don't really understand.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
◇<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
We got permission to rush into the labyrinth after more than a full day had passed.<br/>
Of course I applied for the first group.<br/>
<br/>
I want to run into the labyrinth immediately, but Lilio does not let go of my arms. Though it doesn't mean that I will secede the vanguard position.<br/>
<br/>
First, we secure the first hall that we have entered.<br/>
From here, the plan is to advance the main force whenever we finish securing a room. Although it seems too careful, it's an ironclad rule when you're marching into a labyrinth.<br/>
<br/>
We're advancing slowly through the passage even while I'm feeling frustrated.<br/>
Footsteps sounds are coming from ahead.<br/>
<br/>
I carefully confirm the other side of the corner using mirror.<br/>
You're lying! It's Satou-san!<br/>
<br/>
Not registering this unbelievable good luck, I hesitate for a bit.<br/>
<br/>
I shouldn't have been hesitating.<br/>
From the corner of the passage, I see the figure of Satou-san getting attacked by a beast monster that appears from the wall.<br/>
<br/>
I shake off Lilio who was gripping my arms.<br/>
<br/>
As if under the effect of magic, I jump forward like flying.<br/>
<br/>
I make a landing on the wall of the passage's corner.<br/>
<br/>
The beast monster bites Satou-san.<br/>
<br/>
It's okay.<br/>
<br/>
Satou-san avoided it.<br/>
<br/>
My head becomes pure white, but it's not the time for this.<br/>
<br/>
I cast Air Hammer and blast the beast monster away. It doesn't have enough power to defeat it, but let's pull it away from Satou-san first!<br/>
<br/>
Satou-san got caught in the blast, but the beast monster is successfully separated from him.<br/>
<br/>
Before the beast monster start its counter attack, Nebinen-sama has managed to defeat it. As expected.<br/>
<br/>
I, who is relieved after seeing Satou-san's face, begin to cry and embrace him without wanting to let go.<br/>
Lilio-san makes fun of me like it's other people's problem later.<br/>
<br/>
Even though he has just escaped from such dangerous place like a labyrinth, Satou-san is like the usual Satou-san.<br/>
<br/>
But it may be so that I don't worry too much.<br/>
Since I will be off duty tomorrow, I should make something delicious for him tomorrow morning.<br/>
<br/>
Lilio will most likely make fun of me again.<br/>
<br/>
That kind of ordinary life might be good once in a while.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
