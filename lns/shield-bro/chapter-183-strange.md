Chapter 183: Strange<br/>
Rafatalia lands, and swings her sword to get the liquids off of it. She looks towards us.<br/>
"Hm?" (Naofumi)<br/>
Wow. When I look at Rafatalia’s face, I see sparkles for some reason.<br/>
It’s a face I see every day, but somehow staring at it makes my heart race.<br/>
She’s truly a beauty. She has a fluffy tail and ears, but her body is quite slender.<br/>
She doesn’t have most of the traits associated with Tanukis.<br/>
"Um…" (Naofumi)<br/>
I raise my voice to try and thank her, but speaking is difficult.<br/>
Something’s strange. I could talk to her normally before, but now I can’t even look her in the eye.<br/>
"Amazing…" (Taniko)<br/>
"Rafatalia-chan. You’ve gotten really strong." (Sadina)<br/>
"No, it was almost dead when it came into contact with my blade." (Rafatalia)<br/>
Rafatalia gestures towards the Wrath Dragon’s corpse.<br/>
"I believe that it was Rafatalia-san who saved you when the shield was going to control you, was it not, Naofumi-sama?" (Atlas)<br/>
"Yes, it was, but…" (Naofumi)<br/>
"It seems that Rafatalia-chan was the bane of this one throughout its existence." (Sadina)<br/>
"Firo, are you alright?" (Melty)<br/>
"Yeah. I was in pain, but now I’m fine." (Firo)<br/>
Firo, with Atlas on her back, goes off and embraces Melty.<br/>
"Rafatalia-san returned right after Naofumi-sama left. After explaining the situation, we quickly set out." (Atlas)<br/>
"Firo seemed to be doing bad, so we intended to leave her, but she wouldn’t let us." (Rafatalia)<br/>
Rafatalia pat’s Firo’s head with a troubled expression.<br/>
I’m surprised they could get through these mountains in that short amount of time.<br/>
But Firo, without any carriage attached is unparalleled in speed.<br/>
"Firo was worried we wouldn’t make it." (Firo)<br/>
"But it all worked out. Atlas-san, I am grateful to you as well." (Rafatalia)<br/>
"All of this was for Naofumi-sama." (Atlas)<br/>
Good. With this, the incident is resolved, I guess. I’ll have to talk to Gaelion later.<br/>
"KYUA?" (Gaelion)<br/>
Gaelion pounces on Taniko, and starts licking her face.<br/>
Did he return to normal? Or is he just acting?<br/>
"Gaelion, are you better?" (Taniko)<br/>
"KYUA!" (Gaelion)<br/>
"Give back the things you took from Firo!" (Firo)<br/>
"KYUA!" (Gaelion)<br/>
Gaelion and Firo are glaring at each other again. I shift my gaze to the Wrath Dragon.<br/>
"Your stats are probably over there." (Naofumi)<br/>
"Is that small dragon really Gaelion?" (Rafatalia)<br/>
"Yeah. He pushed himself too hard, and ended up small." (Taniko)<br/>
"Give me back my EXP!" (Firo)<br/>
Firo starts shouting at the Wrath Dragon Corpse.<br/>
She’s an idiot, but she’s cute.<br/>
But Rafatalia is better.<br/>
… Damn,<br/>
I’ve been holding hands with this girl and sleeping next to her.<br/>
"U-um…" (Naofumi)<br/>
I try to talk to Rafatalia without sounding suspicious.<br/>
And she returns a few words.<br/>
"Ah, Naofumi-sama…?" (Rafatalia)<br/>
Rafatalia stares at me and tilts her head. She’s too bright for me to look at.<br/>
My heart is going to jump out of my chest.<br/>
"Um, you are Naofumi-sama, right?" (Rafatalia)<br/>
"Y-yeah." (Naofumi)<br/>
"But You’re a little strange." (Rafatalia)<br/>
"What’s strange?" (Naofumi)<br/>
"Your eyes are… strange. Also, the atmosphere around you is different." (Rafatalia)<br/>
"Really?" (Naofumi)<br/>
This is a girl who’s close to me. A girl who’s travelled and fought next to me.<br/>
Alright, I’ll use a cliché romantic line when we get back to the village.<br/>
…? What? I feel really bad for some reason.<br/>
I’m forgetting something.<br/>
No, Rafatalia has been working really hard as of late.<br/>
I should praise her for that first.<br/>
"You saved us. Thank you. We were in quite a bit of trouble. This is all thanks to Rafatalia." (Naofumi)<br/>
"Naofumi-sama!?" (Rafatalia)<br/>
"If you’d oblige, perhaps we can talk a little later." (Naofumi)<br/>
"Naofumi-sama, you’re definitely acting weird. Your eyes are strange and you’ve never shown such a disgusting smile before. Your way of speaking has also completely changed. Did something happen to you while I was away?" (Rafatalia)<br/>
"Ah, Naofumi-sama has had various things sucked out of him by that corpse lying over there, and he became strange. He fought okay, but he’s become somewhat creepy." (Melty)<br/>
Melty gives a strange explanation.<br/>
"Melty, were you a girl who said such rude things?" (NAofumi)<br/>
I pinch Melty’s cheeks, and take on a smug attitude.<br/>
I always wanted to do something like this.<br/>
"Something’s definitely wrong with this scene!" (Melty & Rafatalia)<br/>
Rafatalia and Melty both point and shout at me.<br/>
What are they on about?<br/>
"I’m concerned about my relationship with Melty from here on -" (Naofumi)<br/>
"Please shut up for a second!" (Melty)<br/>
I don’t know why, but Melty backs off with a red face. Rafatalia and the others begin talking amongst themselves.<br/>
The beauties Rafatalia, Melty and Atlas are huddled together. What a perfect scene.<br/>
"What can we do to make Naofumi-sama turn back?" (Rafatalia)<br/>
"I’ll follow Naofumi-sama no matter what." (Atlas)<br/>
"What are you saying. There’s no way that creepy man over there is the Naofumi-sama we know." (Melty)<br/>
"The foundation is the same. This Naofumi-sama will be able to find happiness easier. Rafatalia-san, please accept this Naofumi-sama." (Atlas)<br/>
"Never!" (Rafatalia)<br/>
She plainly rejects Atlas’s words, and looks over at Sadina and Rat.<br/>
Yeah, Rafatalia’s beauty is a level above the others.<br/>
I think I will find happiness just looking at her.<br/>
But I feel… Strange for some reason. However, I feel really good today, so I’ll let it slide.<br/>
"Can either of you revert Naofumi-sama?" (Rafatalia)<br/>
"This Onee-san has no idea." (Sadina)<br/>
"How about chucking him into that decomposing mass of Dragon over there?" (Rat)<br/>
Both Rat and Sadina point at the Dragon corpse.<br/>
After hearing this, Rafatalia starts to approach me.<br/>
As I stare at her in admiration, she suddenly grasps both of my shoulders.<br/>
My heart skips a beat as I stare into her eyes.<br/>
And…<br/>
"W-wait! What are you people doing!?" (Naofumi)<br/>
Rafatalia and Melty, also Rat and Sadina all lift me up and throw me at the Dragon Corpse.<br/>
"I apologize, Naofumi-sama, but… Please return to normal." (Rafatalia)<br/>
"If Naofumi-chan gets sucked into the dragon, then we’ll have a problem. Rafatalia-chan, good luck." (Sadina)<br/>
"Eh!?" (Everyone)<br/>
Think before you throw!<br/>
What are these girls trying to accomplish? They keep calling me creepy. How rude!<br/>
"Master, what are you doing? Let Firo join." (Firo)<br/>
And Firo nestles next to me in the dead dragon.<br/>
At that moment.<br/>
"Rafatalia! You are my…!" (Naofumi)<br/>
With a loud sound, the shield starts sucking something in.<br/>
At the same time, something appears to be flowing into Firo.<br/>
…Was I forgetting something?<br/>
That was something that I should never have forgotten. My grudge towards Witch and the people of this world.<br/>
And if I made a wrong turn at the beginning, would I have turned out that creepy?<br/>
Blood rushes to my head. Why did I try to hit on the diligent Rafatalia?<br/>
I even looked at Melty and Atlas with lecherous Eyes. Am I supposed to be Motoyasu!?<br/>
"Fumu… I’ve caused you some trouble." (Naofumi)<br/>
Dammit. I still have my memories of a few moments ago.<br/>
Just thinking about it makes me angry.<br/>
I was acting like a dog in heat.<br/>
But at the end, what was I trying to say?<br/>
… I forgot.<br/>
It’s a thing of the past.<br/>
Anyways, it seems that being angry has become my default personality.<br/>
… At least it’s better than that previous state.<br/>
I think I should stop thinking about it.<br/>
"Ah, your eyes are back to normal." (Rafatalia)<br/>
"Naofumi-chan is more likeable when he’s irritated." (Sadina)<br/>
"Ha? What are you trying to say?" (Naofumi)<br/>
"Yeah, this Naofumi is the best one." (Melty)<br/>
It seems everyone can distinguish that my personality is back.<br/>
"Rafatalia, you were a big help. We’ll be returning to the village from now, but what will you do?" (Naofumi)<br/>
"I’ll accompany you to the village, but I still have training after that." (Rafatalia)<br/>
"I see. I apologize for interrupting your training." (Naofumi)<br/>
"No, it was an emergency, so there’s no helping it." (Rafatalia)<br/>
I turn my gaze back to Gaelion.<br/>
"KYUA? (Gaelion)<br/>
"Explain yourself." (Naofumi)<br/>
I think that he was speaking before.<br/>
Though he was only whispering to me.<br/>
"KYUA!" (Gaelion)<br/>
He jumps at me and starts fooling around.<br/>
I stare at him with serious eyes, but his behavior doesn’t change.<br/>
Has he completely returned to normal?<br/>
"Ah! Firo is the one who will play with master!" (Firo)<br/>
"You’re making too much of a fuss! We’re returning now. By the Way, Firo. How is your condition?" (Naofumi)<br/>
"My body is better, but… I didn’t get everything back from Gaelion." (Firo)<br/>
I look at her status.<br/>
Firo’s level is… 41. It’s dropped quite a bit.<br/>
And in contrast, even after separating from the Wrath Dragon, Gaelion’s level is 60.<br/>
Their levels have pretty much flipped.<br/>
"Give them back!" (Firo)<br/>
"KYUA!" (Gaelion)<br/>
And the two glare at each other again.<br/>
"KYUA! KYUA KYUA!" (Gaelion)<br/>
"Gaelion is saying, ‘I don’t know anything about that, but the Hero of the Shield’s favorite is Gaelion.’" (Taniko)<br/>
"Mu…!" (Firo)<br/>
Gaelion got a preemptive strike. He used his short tail to whip Firo’s cheek. He laughs.<br/>
"Give them Back Give them Back Give them Back!" (Firo) (TL: Ora Ora Ora)<br/>
"KYUA KYUA KYUA!" (Gaelion) (TL: Muda Muda Muda)<br/>
The two are now exchanging blows.<br/>
Even though Gaelion was the cause of all of this, he doesn’t seem to be repenting. He’s even going as far as to feign ignorance.<br/>
That’s one of my least favorite actions. I guess I should have him make reparations now.<br/>
"Okay, now then Gaelion. Please return it to Firo. If you become Firo’s dinner, perhaps she will get some of it back." (Naofumi)<br/>
I quickly grab Gaelion, and move him towards Firo’s mouth.<br/>
"KYUAAAA…!?" (Gaelion)<br/>
"NOOOOO!" (Taniko)<br/>
Taniko prevents it.<br/>
"Mu…! Master, what were you trying to feed me!?" (Firo)<br/>
"You’re a glutton, aren’t you? Dragon meat might bring you good luck." (Naofumi)<br/>
"I don’t want to eat dragon anymore!" (Firo)<br/>
Ah, so she’s developed a hatred of the Dragon meat that caused this.<br/>
I hope she keeps a balanced diet.<br/>
"Don’t be such a picky eater." (Naofumi)<br/>
"No!" (Firo)<br/>
"Naofumi-sama… Please don’t give Firo any strange eating habits." (Rafatalia)<br/>
"It’s a sort of punishment. Just let Firo accept her role as a symbol of fear already." (Naofumi)<br/>
"No!" (Firo)<br/>
"Stop doing strange things to Firo!" (Melty)<br/>
This time, Melty steps up to defend Firo.<br/>
And she starts glaring at Taniko.<br/>
"That child was the cause of this turmoil. Please dispose of him." (Melty)<br/>
"He’s already better!" (Taniko)<br/>
Whatever. This is becoming a pain.<br/>
<br/>
