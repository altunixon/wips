Chapter 58.2 : Goddess Of Spider<br/>
「I understand, Kyouka-san… I’ll try to tell Kuroki about this matter.」<br/>
「Thank you, Shirone-san!! I’ll return this favor someday!!」<br/>
Kyouka-san had a happy expression on.<br/>
Well, I don’t really know whether Kuroki would teach her or not. But I think it should be okay since Kuroki is a kind person after all.<br/>
Then again, what was he doing right now?<br/>
I suddenly remembered that Kuroki was currently housesitting along with Rena in Teseshia.<br/>

Chapter By WordExcerpt<br/>
◆Valkyrie, Shizufae<br/>
「DAMMIT! WHY CAN’T I TAKE A PEEK?!」<br/>
The Hero of Wind, Zefa, cursed with a loud voice.<br/>
This was because Shirone-sama and Kyouka-sama, both wearing a swimsuit, were resting on the ship’s bow.<br/>
「What the hell are you talking about? Do you want to be killed by Kaya-sama?」<br/>
Big sis Keyna rebuked Zefa with an exhausted tone.<br/>
Kaya-sama was a really scary person… I also heard that she was as strong, if not, even more powerful than Chiyuki-sama.<br/>
I mean… if you had multiple lives, it still wouldn’t be enough if you somehow angered that kind of person.<br/>
They were simply beyond our reach, we shouldn’t even have any thoughts of doing something strange to them.<br/>
Anyhow, it seems that Shirone-sama managed to get the cooperation from the lizardmen while saving me from the labyrinth.<br/>
Chapter By WordExcerpt<br/>
I mean, we’re talking about lizardmen here, they’re a race that wouldn’t listen to humans unless we placed shackles or a collar on them.<br/>
And Zefa here was actually daring to try and peek on my benefactor.<br/>
「But… they’re such beauties, you know? Don’t you think that it’s wrong if we, as gentlemen, don’t even try to look at them? Am I right, Hero of Fire?」<br/>
Zefa suddenly dragged Novis into the conversation.<br/>
「No, I mean…. You’re kind of correct…」<br/>
Novis hesitantly agreed with him.<br/>
「Give it up already…. Are you trying to incite Shirone-sama’s wrath again?」<br/>
I rebuked Novis’ words.<br/>
「Even so… Don’t you think that it’ll be your loss as a man if you wouldn’t take a look at Kyouka-sama and Shirone-sama’s current appearance? How should I say this….」<br/>
Novis said with pride, he apparently wasn’t giving up on this.<br/>
「The hell are you talking about?」<br/>
I couldn’t help but facepalm. This idiot will never learn from his mistake unless I point it out.<br/>
Though… It’s not like I don’t understand his feelings.<br/>
I mean, despite her huge breasts, Kyouka-sama has such a slender waist.<br/>
And though Shirone-sama loses in terms of breast size, her chest was still considered as cut above the rest by this world’s standard. In addition, she also has a pair of long and slender legs. In fact, her figure was much more balanced than Kyouka-sama’s.<br/>
Even I, who was the same gender as them, quite envied their well proportioned figures. This was why I understood his emotions of wanting to see their swimsuit figures.<br/>
However, it doesn’t mean that I would let these idiots do that. Shirone-sama was my benefactor. I’ll do everything I can to prevent these idiots from disturbing them.<br/>
It also seems she didn’t meet the Dark Knight when she found me collapsed in the labyrinth.<br/>
But still… who knew what would have happened to me if she didn’t find me at that time. Moreover, it was also thanks to Shirone-sama that my wound was treated by Goddess-sama herself.<br/>
I felt like the luckiest girl in the world for getting personal treatment from the super beautiful goddess.<br/>
It was said that Goddess Rena-sama was the epitome of beauty, and that there was nothing but gentle affection in her heart. I now know that this rumor about her was true after I met the person herself.<br/>
I mean, it was already surprising in and of itself that I was able to meet the goddess herself.<br/>
This is why I’ve yet to properly show my gratitude to Shirone-sama.<br/>
I was right here at this very moment for the sake of repaying this favor to her.<br/>
Thus, I have imposed on myself with a duty to prevent those idiots — Also known as Novis and company — from trying to do something stupid.<br/>
Or so I thought when I came here by myself, for some reason though, Keyna-sama also tagged along with me.<br/>
My miscalculation, however, was the fact that the Hero of Water, Nephim, and the Hero of Wind, Zefa, also came along with us. It seemed that they tagged along for their own agendas.<br/>
Somehow, Novis seemed to hate this addition.<br/>
「Ha!」<br/>
A pillar of water suddenly appeared from the river’s surface.<br/>
A man descended to the deck of the ship alongside this sudden situation.<br/>
It was Nephim, the Hero of Water. Since he could freely move underwater, he chose to dive along with the lizardmen into the river.<br/>
He then dried his drenched hair with a theatrical movement. His light blue hair danced beautifully as he shook his head.<br/>
Nephim was currently wearing a swimsuit for men that encased his well-toned body, and despite him being handsome as Reiji-sama, I had to say that Nephim’s appearance was a cut above the rest of the human males in this world.<br/>
「… Fuuh.」<br/>
After heaving a sigh, Nephim walked towards the starboard and kneeled on there. A ladder which descended toward the river was in front of him.<br/>
Shortly after, a woman appeared from the surface of the water around the ladder.<br/>
She was one of Kyouka-sama’s and Shirone-sama’s attendants, her name was Regena-san.<br/>
She volunteered herself to dive into the river to command the lizardmen in Shirone-sama and company’s place.<br/>
I heard a rumor that Regena-san was a former princess of a certain country…<br/>
How did someone in her position end up becoming an attendant? Could it be that she had a rather spicy background?<br/>
However, she was definitely more useful than the male attendant who got punched by Novis, there was also the fact that she could command the lizardmen.<br/>
It also seemed that she could move underwater too, just like Nephim.<br/>
Regena-san grabbed onto the ladder, and then, she slowly climbed back up to the deck of the ship.<br/>
「Here, please take my hand, Regena.」<br/>
Nephim stretched his hand as he said those words. Despite his offer, Regena ignored him while she nonchalantly continued climbing on the ladder.<br/>
Nephim, who got ignored, was smiling wryly.<br/>
Novis and Zefa were smiling gleefully at the situation. Good grief… these idiots…<br/>
「Uhm, please use this…」<br/>
I gave her a clean and dry cloth for her to wipe her body.<br/>
「Thank you very much…」<br/>
Regena-san bowed in response, she also showed a gentle smile when she did so.<br/>
As I looked at her wiping her body, I thought that she was a beautiful person too.<br/>
Chesnut-colored hair and porcelain-white skin… Though not as sexy as Shirone-sama or Kyouka-sama, her body had just the right curves.<br/>
The fact that she only had a swimsuit on also emphasized that fact even further.<br/>
Could it be that the girls who were working around Reiji-sama all had this kind of beauty?<br/>
It was to the point that I was starting to lose my confidence as a woman.<br/>
I mean… the woman who had the smallest chest in this ship was none other than me. I don’t think I would ever wear a swimsuit around these kinds of super beauties, even if I wasn’t Faeria’s believer.<br/>
「This is quite…」<br/>
「Yeah…」<br/>
Zefa and Novis were ogling at Regena, the latter was still wiping her body.<br/>
I desperately endured the impulse to kick these idiots into the river.<br/>
「You guys… Please stop looking at my Regena with those dirty looks on your faces.」<br/>
Nephim stood in front of Regena, shielding her from Novis and Zefa’s sight.<br/>
「Ah! What the heck are you talking about? Stop trying to monopolize her for yourself!」<br/>
「In the first place, since when did Regena-san become yours?!」<br/>
The two idiots quickly snapped back at Nephim.<br/>
Nephim smiled as he looked at the two men.<br/>
「By the way, how about having a dinner with me, Regena?」<br/>
Nephim asked with a serious expression on his face.<br/>
It seemed like he was trying to woo Regena-san even when they were inside the river earlier.<br/>
Regena-san simply treated him coldly, almost to the point of ignoring him.<br/>
「Uhm…. Thanks for the offer, but I can’t accept it since I already have a master.」<br/>
Regena-san, with a troubled look on her face, flat out rejected Novis.<br/>
Other than the idiot trio’s reactions aside, even big sis Keyna had a surprised look on her face.<br/>
This also included me of course.<br/>
「Hee\~ A husband, huh? You just dealt a critical blow to these guys.」<br/>
Big sis Keyna commented as she observed Regena-san.<br/>
Regena-san was married, huh? Even though we were supposed to be the same age.<br/>
This part was what made me rather surprised.<br/>
「Regena-san has a husband1could be heard or interpreted as ‘master’?! I wonder what kind of a person your husband* is…」<br/>
I unintentionally asked this question.<br/>
Since Reiji-sama wasn’t married yet, the husband she was referring to might not be him. I couldn’t help but wonder what kind of person her husband was.<br/>
It made me extremely curious as the priestess of the Goddess of Marriage.<br/>
「He’s an extremely, gentle and warm person…」<br/>
Regena-san replied with a gentle smile on her face.<br/>
She was truly enchanting at this moment.<br/>
I let out a groan when I heard her say this. Honestly speaking? I was jealous of her.<br/>
When I glanced to the side, I saw the Nephim’s figure slumped down on the floor.<br/>
Poor guy… but with this, I guess one idiot is down for the count.<br/>
But I was really curious about the identity of Regena’s husband, I mean… What made him so special that just a mention about him was enough for Regena-san to make such a face?<br/>
I really wanted to meet him someday.<br/>
