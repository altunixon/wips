Chapter 199: The Morning of the Shield Hero<br/>
I have to get up early in the mornings.<br/>
I wake up much earlier than the slaves.<br/>
Of course, this is only when I don’t stay up too late into the night.<br/>
Occasionally I stay up making medicine or completing other miscellaneous tasks.<br/>
Yesterday, we dragged Ren to the village. I was tired from battle, so I slept early.<br/>
I look in the bed next to mine, and see Sadina sleeping peacefully with Atlas.<br/>
"Uu… Sadina-san. You’re being too forceful…" (Atlas)<br/>
"St…op~…" (Sadina)<br/>
What exactly are these two dreaming about?<br/>
Are they training in their dreams as well? What sort of Manga is this?<br/>
"Kyua… Kyua…" (Gaelion)<br/>
Just in case, child mode Gaelion is on standby in my bed. If Atlas tries to crawl into the bed, he has to drive her out.<br/>
Now then.<br/>
I crawl out of bed and leave the room.<br/>
I randomly do some stretches, and quietly walk through the village, listening to the soft sound of the waves.<br/>
I’m heading towards the Camping Plant house Ren is currently staying in.<br/>
Ah, by the way, Gaelion’s Dargon Sanctuary has already been set up.<br/>
When I asked him what the maintenance cost was, he said something like once it had been activated once, the spell permanently made an anti-teleportation area until he dispelled it.<br/>
But as soon as the magic was activated, the Filo Rial ran away at an alarming pace.<br/>
It seems he has a bad affinity with it.<br/>
He will no longer enter the village, so we had to make another stable for him outside. But this is just a temporary measure. I don’t know what to do later.<br/>
Perhaps I should teleport to the castle and report to the Queen.<br/>
But before that, there is something I must do.<br/>
The house Ren is in is used by Female Knight.<br/>
I reach a wall of the room Ren is in.<br/>
In order to stop Ren from escaping, many knights and slaves are stationed within the house. I can’t go through the front door.<br/>
「… Emergency Exit」 (Naofumi)<br/>
I whisper these words to the Camping Plant while infusing my voice with magic.<br/>
And in response to this, a door appears on the wall.<br/>
The plants have been altered to take certain commands from me, and I can create a passageway anywhere.<br/>
Only me and Rat know of it. It’s a secret function.<br/>
"Good." (Naofumi)<br/>
I infiltrate Ren’s room, and confirm that he’s asleep.<br/>
And then proceed to whisper in his ear.<br/>
"Among the Heroes, you are the weakest. You are nothing but a king of Thieves. All of this is your fault." (Naofumi)<br/>
"u…uu…" (Ren)<br/>
Whap!<br/>
From behind, a fan like thing made from folding numerous Bioplant leaves comes in contact with my head.<br/>
It doesn’t hurt at all.<br/>
I turn around and find Female Knight staring at me angrily with her arms crossed.<br/>
"What do you think you’re doing, Iwatani-dono!?" (Female Knight)<br/>
"Don’t shout. You’ll wake up Ren." (Naofumi)<br/>
I just wanted to give him a few nightmares.<br/>
Now then, to whisper more…<br/>
"The ghosts of those killed by the Spirit Turtle are…" (Naofumi)<br/>
"Won’t you stop!?" (Female Knight)<br/>
"Where did you come from, anyways? This is Ren’s room, right?" (Naofumi)<br/>
"That’s what I should be saying." (Female Knight)<br/>
"Well, the Camping Plant was an innovation made by me and Rat. What about you?" (Naofumi)<br/>
In order to prevent his escape, the room should be locked.<br/>
Why is she in here?<br/>
Could they have possibly slept together?<br/>
No, that wouldn’t happen with these two.<br/>
"It’s too late to act once something happens. I was resting in the closet." (Female Knight)<br/>
"You sure like to sleep in strange places." (Naofumi)<br/>
Like that blue cat thing.<br/>
The closet is the only difference.<br/>
"You’re… wrong. Oh, Raphtalia. I am unable to contain Naofumi-dono. Please come home soon." (Female Knight)<br/>
Female Knight complains as she drives me out of the room.<br/>
"Ah, so you fell for Ren." (Naofumi)<br/>
Though not as handsome as Motoyasu, he is a pretty boy.<br/>
I don’t know Female Knight’s actual age, but she seems young. Around my age, perhaps?<br/>
"There’s a limit to fooling around. I have no time to spend on something like love. And also, I declare that this boy is not my type!" (Female Knight)<br/>
"What a coincidence. He’s not my type either." (Naofumi)<br/>
"Iwatani-dono enjoys getting people mad. I heard as such from Raphtalia. You really are quite a villain." (Female Knight)<br/>
"Yeah, that’s right." (Naofumi)<br/>
"*Sigh*… why must all the heroes be like this…" (Female Knight)<br/>
Female Knight’s sigh is quite heavy.<br/>
What could be troubling her so much? No, I know the answer.<br/>
Will she complain to Raphtalia about me?<br/>
I can’t even count the misdeeds I’ve committed since I got here.<br/>
Quite a few nobles of this country have become my prey.<br/>
I sold second rate gems at a high price, and used cheap medicine to give pricey medical treatments using my shield’s enhancements.<br/>
I guess I can’t help it if Raphtalia comes to be skeptical of me for it.<br/>
She’ll probably believe it if this diligent knight calls me a villain.<br/>
"Oh yeah, you’re quite strong." (Naofumi)<br/>
"I was able to see the flow of magic from the beginning. But neither you nor the military instructor would train me. But still, I desperately tried, and finally got the instructor to train me. Even though she taught me techniques, those were only the basics. Most of my techniques were ones I made on my own." (Female Knight)<br/>
"I see…" (Naofumi)<br/>
"The move I used was one I just finished recently. I wasn’t sure if it would work." (Female Knight)<br/>
Is she similar to Atlas?<br/>
Energy and Magic.<br/>
She can see the flow of the power known as magic, and can utilize it.<br/>
Though there’s probably some differences.<br/>
Atlas reads the flow of Chi and Female Knight, the flow of magic.<br/>
Currently, the only one I understand is the latter.<br/>
When I returned, I asked the villagers, but besides me and Ren, there doesn’t seem to be much of a difference in their magical flows.<br/>
Though Rishia’s flow is notably smaller than that of the others.<br/>
One thing that I did learn was that the flow of magic was something used in these people’s everyday lives.<br/>
Like how we don’t realize that our muscles are moving and that our blood is moving, magic flows within the body without their conscious input.<br/>
"Raphtalia has a technique where she fires the energy released by a defeated enemy and converts it into an attack, right? That’s an improved version of my technique." (Female Knight)<br/>
Ah, that’s right.<br/>
Rafatalia called it something like Ying Yang Blade.<br/>
I thought it was a strange technique. So this person taught it to her<br/>
I guess she’s also a genius. And she isn’t neglecting hard work. Even though her status is low, she manages to hold her ground all the same.<br/>
I guess I should ask.<br/>
"Hey, do you want to obtain strength by becoming a slave?" (Naofumi)<br/>
"The prospect does seem fascinating, but my status prevents me from doing so." (Female Knight)<br/>
"I see… By the way, why was someone as diligent as you not there when I was summoned?" (Naofumi)<br/>
"Let me first apologize. I’m sorry. The knights were unable to right the wrongs of this country because of my incompetence." (Female Knight)<br/>
Female Knight gives a deep apology before she continues.<br/>
"This may sound like an excuse, but when Iwatani-dono had been summoned and was being treated as a prisoner… I was in a jail cell in the castle." (Female Knight)<br/>
"Hm? So you were a criminal?" (Naofumi)<br/>
"If that were the case, I would never be chosen to become a knight. Though my status has fallen." (Female Knight)<br/>
Well, a criminal wouldn’t be able to become a knight anyways.<br/>
But why was this straight-laced person being imprisoned?<br/>
Perhaps it was her straight-lacedness that put her in prison.<br/>
This country is full of trash, so I guess there’s no helping it.<br/>
"Perhaps my heritage was a contributing factor, but the actions I took by myself were judged as crimes by the country." (Female Knight)<br/>
"What is your heritage?" (Naofumi)<br/>
"This territory." (Female Knight)<br/>
"What?" (Naofumi)<br/>
"I’m the daughter of the person who used to be the lord of this land. Though I say that, I was away at the castle for a long time training to be a knight. I never spent much time here, so my memories of the place are vague." (Female Knight)<br/>
"Ah… I see." (Naofumi)<br/>
So that’s why she could talk to Raphtalia so easily.<br/>
They got close to each other through common heritage.<br/>
Her face made me think she was from some noble family, but I never thought it was here.<br/>
"My father fought on the front lines during the first wave in order to let the people flee… and perished." (Female Knight)<br/>
"I see." (Naofumi)<br/>
"Before he died, my father told me to, ‘Live nobly without any regrets’." (Female Knight)<br/>
The Queen, then Raphtalia and Sadina all praised the lord. He must have been a good person.<br/>
I think Raphtalia said he was a kind man who treated Demi-Humans well.<br/>
And this is his daughter.<br/>
I took over his role and am now a Count.<br/>
Perhaps the reason the Queen pushed a title onto me was to make me follow in his footsteps.<br/>
"Later, I and many others were stationed in this land, but… Adventurers, and a portion of the Knights and Solders began hunting Demi-Humans." (Female Knight)<br/>
"Ah, so this is where the villagers got dragged in." (Naofumi)<br/>
"Yes. I objected to these people, and was imprisoned for standing up for the Demi-humans who were supposed to be living peacefully on that land." (Female Knight)<br/>
"…" (Naofumi)<br/>
"Of course, I consider the slave system to be a necessary evil in this world. But for people who were being devastated by the wave, people who, until that day were citizens we were supposed to protect, What meaning is there for knights to assault them!? Just because father died, the world will treat them as such?" (Female Knight)<br/>
Yeah, this country truly is rotten.<br/>
Other people who thought the same as Female Knight were incarcerated as well.<br/>
Many of the knights helping out in the neighboring village are the ones who were imprisoned with Female Knight.<br/>
"Eventually, I was proclaimed innocent by the Queen and released. This was around the time Iwatani-dono was at Cal Mira Island." (Female Knight)<br/>
"I’m surprised you avoided execution." (Naofumi)<br/>
"It was quite close." (Female Knight)<br/>
"Really?"v(Naofumi)<br/>
"Fufu. I was accused of having Demi-Human blood, and being a brainwashed follower of the Devil of the Shield. I was told that I was not a suitable individual for knighthood." (Female Knight)<br/>
"How the hell was I supposed to brainwash someone imprisoned before I was even summoned…?" (Naofumi)<br/>
Were they planning to execute her and all of those in support of Demi-Humans along with me when they caught me?<br/>
The Three Hero Church did hold resentment towards Demi-Humans so perhaps that would have happened if we lost.<br/>
Trash seems to have a deep-seeded hatred as well, so that’s a likely possibility.<br/>
"Got it. I get that now and before, you lived as your father told you and became a straight-laced person. Now what you have to do is become a little more underhanded." (Naofumi)<br/>
"Rejected!" (Female Knight)<br/>
What she wanted to say was that she was in prison so she couldn’t defend me, right?<br/>
If she were there, then if she raised an objection, Trash and Witch… would have imprisoned her anyways.<br/>
Either way, she would have gone to jail… how absurd.<br/>
This is a rotten society that punishes honest people.<br/>
I won’t say the people who weren’t there are in the wrong.<br/>
I consider Female Knight to be my ally.<br/>
Even though she tried to fight me yesterday, I’m the one who started it.<br/>
"And so? You said Raphtalia left something to you, right? What was it?" (Naofumi)<br/>
"…Ah." (Female Knight)<br/>
Female Knight stares at the horizon.<br/>
There’s nothing there, you know.<br/>
"To summarize, she told me to stop you if you did something bad. She told me a lot of other things too." (Female Knight)<br/>
"That does sound like something Raphtalia would do." (Naofumi)<br/>
Raphtalia complains whenever I do something unbefitting of a Hero.<br/>
Inversely, Atlas agrees to whatever I do, and it’s hard to contain her.<br/>
I can’t control myself well, so it’s difficult for me to deal with that type of person.<br/>
She seems to see an illusion that everything that I do is just.<br/>
Because of that, Raphtalia’s orders were correct.<br/>
If Raphtalia were there, she would have taken similar actions as Female Knight.<br/>
"Today I’m going to the castle. What will you do?" (Naofumi)<br/>
"That depends on the Hero of the Sword’s behavior. After I question him… I’m tired. I’ll just continue keeping watch over him." (Female Knight)<br/>
"Gaelion has set up a barrier, but if he escapes beyond its bounds there’s nothing you can do so be careful." (Naofumi)<br/>
"It didn’t look like he intended on running. If he runs, I intend to take full responsibility for it." (Female Knight)<br/>
After returning to the village, Ren regained consciousness.<br/>
But his expression was dark. He said he would take any punishment thrown at him, and he sat down and waited patiently.<br/>
He regained consciousness quite late at night.<br/>
We were all quite sleepy, so we let him sleep.<br/>
"Should I wake him and ask for his story?" (Naofumi)<br/>
"Stop it. Just let him rest peacefully for now." (Female Knight)<br/>
"… Then I guess I’ll wait. It’s no fun interrogating a sleepy person anyways." (Naofumi)<br/>
I guess I’m being too harsh.<br/>
If I do any more, Female Knight will tattle to Raphtalia.<br/>
Though I think it’s already too late for me to worry about that.<br/>
After that, I stopped by the monster stables. I distribute food to the monsters, and let them run around for a bit.<br/>
I played with them using the Frisbee shield, branches and balls. We also played something similar to tag.<br/>
Some of the slaves who also woke up early joined the game.<br/>
It’s only the people who aren’t out peddling.<br/>
Dunes are domestic monsters, so they always participate.<br/>
They get along well with the Lemo slaves.<br/>
"Wan Wan! Shield Niichan! More!" (Kiel)<br/>
Kiel comes to me holding a branch in her mouth.<br/>
…Yes, this one’s definitely a dog in every definition of the word.<br/>
When I returned to the village, the first thing that surprised me…<br/>
Was Kiel’s dog form.<br/>
She looks exactly like a puppy. As for breed, she looks like a Siberian Husky.<br/>
(Google image search Siberian Husky Puppy. You won’t regret it.)<br/>
"Niichan, welcome home!" (Kiel)<br/>
When I got back, I was greeted by a loincloth-clad puppy walking on two legs. I thought I was going crazy.<br/>
"You…" (Naofumi)<br/>
"Hehe, cool, isn’t it? Sadina-neechan taught me." (Kiel)<br/>
Kiel seems very proud… but the other villagers have complicated expressions.<br/>
It is quite amazing. She looks like an animal you would keep for a pet.<br/>
She isn’t menacing at all.<br/>
"Kiel-chan looked like she had the talent, so I taught her~" (Sadina)<br/>
"Talent…" (Naofumi)<br/>
Oh right. Sadina keeps up that form through transformation as well.<br/>
"Wa… Kiel-kun has become cute." (Rishia)<br/>
Rishia picks Kiel up and starts petting her.<br/>
I can understand her feelings.<br/>
I also have the sudden urge to pet her.<br/>
"So? Are there more people who can take up a beast form in the village? Is it even useful?" (Naofumi)<br/>
"It depends on the race, but the ability generally increases stats. Like me." (Sadina)<br/>
"I see…" (Naofumi)<br/>
"There’s also a matter of talent, so most people in this village probably can’t do it." (Sadina)<br/>
"I see. How about Raphtalia?" (Naofumi)<br/>
"I don’t think Raphtalia-chan can." (Sadina)<br/>
I’m slightly happy that Raphtalia won’t transform like this.<br/>
For some reason, I imagine Shigaraki. (TL: Standard Tanuki Statue. Google it)<br/>
I don’t really want to ruin my mind’s image of Raphtalia.<br/>
If she were here, perhaps she would think the same.<br/>
"Niichan, are you thinking of something strange right now?" (Kiel)<br/>
Kiel asks with a curious expression. No idea.<br/>
"Well, is it really something that great?" (Atlas)<br/>
"Yes, Kiel-kun looks cute." (Rishia)<br/>
Atlas is tilting her head.<br/>
She can’t even see the change, so her response is understandable.<br/>
"Don’t call me cute! Aren’t I cool?" (Kiel)<br/>
"Not with that appearance." (Naofumi)<br/>
After I say this, Kiel looks crestfallen. Her head droops.<br/>
"This can’t be… I thought I had finally become cool…" (Kiel)<br/>
"Even your normal form is better in that aspect." (Naofumi)<br/>
Her face is quite girlish though, so she still falls into the cute category.<br/>
Watching us, Sadina starts laughing to herself.<br/>
Don’t depress the girl any further.<br/>
"By the way, Fohl-chan also has the talent." (Sadina)<br/>
"What… was that?" (Atlas)<br/>
Atlas is at a loss for words.<br/>
What? What exactly could be pulling on her heartstrings to this extent?<br/>
"Onii-sama just got a wonderful nickname from Naofumi-sama, and on top of that he learns to take on a cute form. He must be aiming for Naofumi-sama’s heart. I’m envious. I’m jealous." (Atlas)<br/>
… This is no good.<br/>
