Hero of the Spear’s companions<br/>
After getting off the ship, and passing through a hot spring, we arrived at the demon’s habitat<br/>
Now then, let’s hurry up and level with Motoyasu’s women so we can go home……<br/>
Naofumi:"I want you guys to understand that your non-cooperative attitude isn’t going to work, you are forced to help because I am a hero."<br/>
Bitch:"I don’t need you tell me."<br/>
Woman 1:"Are you an idiot?"<br/>
Naofumi:"……You guys are the fools."<br/>
Good grief, Why do I have to put with these goddamn women to go demon hunting?……<br/>
We are currently in the middle of a Level grinding event.<br/>
I saw several adventurers fighting demons here and there.<br/>
This event feels very similar to ones in net games on Earth.<br/>
Well, the problem is with my companions.<br/>
Naofumi:"Hmm……"<br/>
This area is inhabited by Violet Blobs, Magenta Frogs, Yellow Beetles, and Cactus worms.<br/>
They don’t seem very strong.<br/>
As I was analysing the area, a Magenta Frog jumps out of a bush to attack us.<br/>
Naofumi:"Yotto."<br/>
I hit the Magenta Frog’s stomach in mid-air with my shield.<br/>
With a splat, the Magenta frog stuck to my shield.<br/>
Naofumi:"Hey"<br/>
I give instructions to Motoyasu’s women.<br/>
Bitch:"What do you want?"<br/>
Naofumi:"Use your sword or magic to fight."<br/>
Bitch:"I know!"<br/>
Good grief, if you know then why are you making me explain.<br/>
Bitch:"Fire Slash!"<br/>
Bitch’s sword erupts in flame as she recites her magic.<br/>
The fire shoots out from the tip of the sword and tears the Magenta Frog apart.<br/>
95 Exp acquired.<br/>
Hmm…..As expected, the strength to experience ratio is very good.<br/>
Naofumi:"Now then,for the time being, let’s hunt properly."<br/>
Bitch:"……fine."<br/>
Naofumi:"Good grief."<br/>
There is a limit to being uncooperative. Irresponsible participating is fine to some extent, but……<br/>
No matter how much I think about it, there is no way they can become strong like this.<br/>
Naofumi:"Truthfully, I cannot attack on my own-"<br/>
Bitch:"Right. So lame."<br/>
Naofumi:"……Mu!"<br/>
Who the hell is lame!?<br/>
Naofumi:"That reminds me, isn’t your hero just a fool who thinks with his lower half and chases any women?"<br/>
Bitch:"What are you saying! Are you going to insult Motoyasu-sama!?"<br/>
Naofumi:"Am I wrong? If I am wrong then tell me how you usually fight."<br/>
Bitch:"Fine, I’ll teach you."<br/>
Bitch, Woman 1, and Woman 2. These are Motoyasu’s companions.<br/>
Woman 1 uses a sword and seems strong. I can see that her reflexes are good. She is the one who Raphtalia stabbed. Her hair is brown and medium length.<br/>
Woman 2’s facial expressions constantly change, and she has a rod. Is she in charge of magic?<br/>
There hasn’t been any magic support so far……How do they usually fight?<br/>
When it was Bitch’s turn she just disregards her explanation and says.<br/>
Bitch:"Our job is to support Motoyasu-sama in an emergency."<br/>
Naofumi:"What!?"<br/>
I yelled unintentionally.<br/>
What the hell is this bitch saying?<br/>
Woman2:"Other than that, Mal……Whore-sama instructs us to cover Motoyasu-sama with magic."<br/>
Naofumi:"……You don’t fight?"<br/>
Woman2:"I’ll fight if there is a melee. But, Motoyasu-sama protects us so that won’t happen."<br/>
Protecting them……<br/>
I have a headache.<br/>
In other words, while Motoyasu fights, these women just sit back and cheer him on?<br/>
Occasionally supporting with magic……All the fighting is done by Motoyasu?<br/>
Woman1:"That’s pretty much it. Sometimes I cut up weak demons with my sword, while she sometimes uses magic."<br/>
Naofumi:"What about Whore?"<br/>
Woman1:" Whore-sama burns them."<br/>
Other than the small fries left for the women, Motoyasu mows down all the stronger enemies.<br/>
That’s like a Princess play in Net Games……<br/>
Oh wait, Bitch used to be a princess.<br/>
Bitch:"Motoyasu-sama would always say to us:"Levelling up through such dirty methods does not suit cuties like you."<br/>
Woman1:"Therefore, our fight is to support and restore his spirit."<br/>
Woman2:"Right! So I put my efforts in cleaning equipment and learning support magic."<br/>
Bitch:"It is our duty to heal Motoyasu-sama’s spirits afterwards. Every minute and every second of our attention is focused on Motoyasu-sama."<br/>
……Feels disgusting.<br/>
I just imagine them behind me.<br/>
These women are strong enough to kick around the demons around here…… If they were to participate, would Motoyasu even need to fight?<br/>
Woman1:" I hope that Motoyasu-sama would rely on us a little."<br/>
Woman2:"Right. However, even without our power as support,he is cool."<br/>
Bitch:"Yeah, completely different from the Shield who cannot do anything at all, and has to rely on his companions."<br/>
Everytime Bitch opens her mouth she compares me to Motoyasu.<br/>
Naofumi:"Is that right!? But, right now you are hunting demons with me. I don’t know about Motoyasu, but you have to attack for me."<br/>
Bitch:"……You suck."<br/>
Naofumi:"You’re the one who sucks!"<br/>
Good greif, does Motoyasu actually enjoy accompanying these three parasites?<br/>
Bitch:"Motoyasu-sama would help us attack theses demons."<br/>
Woman1:"He really is wonderful!"<br/>
All 3:"""I know right~"""<br/>
Bitch:"How can the shield compare? Forcing us to stay and defeat demons for him."<br/>
All 3:"""I know right~"""<br/>
Annoying!<br/>
I want to return already!<br/>
What is wrong with these girls.<br/>
Anyway, they are just putting on appearances for Motoyasu.<br/>
Something like……<br/>
Wonderful! Hold me! Like that?<br/>
I can never understand the charm of such sluts.<br/>
To me it’s like, they become the background.<br/>
Suddenly a strong demon appears and I take the lead to engage it!<br/>
A figure fighting with wind and flying freely comes to mind.<br/>
I mean, why am I being severely criticized here?<br/>
It’s probably just Bitch and her followers, that influenced Motoyasu in the first place.<br/>
Feels disgusting.<br/>
At least, Bitch, Woman 1, and Woman 2 are fighting with the demon as per my instructions.<br/>
I cannot fight.<br/>
However……Bitch keeps chanting magic and discontinuing it.<br/>
Somehow……It’s like she is waiting for something.<br/>
I’m trying to think of a what, but……<br/>
And so, with these feelings 30 minutes has passed. I wonder where shadow went.<br/>
As I engage a demon with my shield, and wait for support magic to come.<br/>
"I am the next queen who commands the origin of power. I have read and deciphered a law of nature. Target him and-"<br/>
""I am one who commands the origin of power. I have read and deciphered a law of nature–""<br/>
As they chant an unusually strong spell is about to be activated, Shadow instantly appears behind Bitch and puts a knife to her throat.<br/>
Bitch:"Hie!?"<br/>
Shadow:"Whore-dono and companions, your magic is giving off too much blood-thirst dogojaruyo."<br/>
Bitch:"W-We did not do anything. Just co-operating with the shield."<br/>
Shadow:"That’s not what it looks like degojaru."<br/>
Naofumi:"What’s wrong?"<br/>
Bitch stops her magic as Shadow watches her closely.<br/>
Shadow:"A while ago I heard her muttering to herself degojaru."<br/>
Naofumi:"And? Did you understand it?"<br/>
Shadow:"I did degojaru."<br/>
Naofumi:"What was it?"<br/>
Shadow:"Seems to be about investigating the limits of the slave crest degojaru."<br/>
Naofumi:"Ah……I see."<br/>
There were several conditions on the slave crest that prevent certain actions.<br/>
I understand because I tried it with Raphtalia and Firo.<br/>
Since Raphtalia is strong, it occasionally went off when she was overly familiar with me.<br/>
Forgetting about the mark is easy since I don’t use it.<br/>
Shadow:"The queen does not use contract slaves deogjarukara. She seems to be searching for a loop-hole degojarou."<br/>
The queen’s conditions. Possibly……<br/>
I recall the conditions the queen set up.<br/>
"The condition is attacking Iwatani-sama. Whether by direct attack with magic or indirect attack with poison, nothing is allowed!"<br/>
An attack aimed at me……If there was one……<br/>
Naofumi:"Were they targeting the demon with magic while I was in the way, so that the attack would hit me?"<br/>
Shadow:"That is correct degojaru."<br/>
Bitch:"Y-you’re wrong!"<br/>
Shadow:"Then why did you stop and move to cancel your spells earlier degojaru?"<br/>
Bitch:"Th-That is because……It was not to involve the shield in anything!"<br/>
What a desperate excuse.<br/>
Woman1&2:"That’s right! We just cast magic according to the Shield’s instructions!""<br/>
Shadow:"That spell I stopped earlier was at full power degojaruna."<br/>
Bitch:"There was no other way to defeat the demon!"<br/>
I wonder……<br/>
In fact, not even 5 Cactus Worms can wound me a little.<br/>
Frankly, they are all small fries.<br/>
They would instantly become Firo’s food.<br/>
Shadow:"It doesn’t hurt for Hero of the Shield-dono degojaru?"<br/>
Naofumi:"Not at all."<br/>
Shadow:"Quite sturdy deogjaruna……"<br/>
Shadow just said something in a goofy voice.<br/>
Shadow:"Anyway, it doesn’t seem like you are reflecting degojaruna."<br/>
Bitch:"I didn’t know!"<br/>
Bitch has been completely seen through.<br/>
Shadow leaks a sigh.<br/>
Shadow:"Can’t be helped degojaruna."<br/>
She extends her index finger and activates a status magic.<br/>
Bitch’s slave crest appears.<br/>
Bitch:"Eh!? Why!?"<br/>
Shadow:"The queen has entrusted former princess Bitch’s slave control to me degojaru."<br/>
Well, that’s just how it is.<br/>
Bitch:"Kyaaaaaaaaaa!"<br/>
The pattern glows and Bitch rolls on the floor in pain.<br/>
Seriously……To do something so stupid.<br/>
Woman 1 and 2 are pale as they watch.<br/>
Shadow:"I hope you understand degojaruka, treat Hero-dono with respect, or else I’ll punish you until you understand degojaruyo. After, I’ll notify the queen degojaru."<br/>
Bitch:"Th-That’s–"<br/>
Shadow:"If you understand then obediently listen to Hero of the Shield-dono degojaruyo."<br/>
The women held their breath.<br/>
A minute of punishment is not enough. I am also reaching my limits.<br/>
Naofumi:"Shadow."<br/>
Shadow:" What degojaru?"<br/>
Naofumi:"I am reaching the limits of my patience."<br/>
Shdaow:"……"<br/>
Shadow seems to think about my promise with the queen anxiously.<br/>
Naofumi:"Shadow, please remove all prohibitions on Bitch temporarily."<br/>
Shadow:"I have to report what you do to the former princess you know degojaru?"<br/>
Naofumi:"Yeah, I know. Hey, Bitch. You really want to kill me? I’ll keep you company. Let’s not play with unnecessary strategies."<br/>
Bitch:"Ku……"<br/>
As the restraints from the slave crest are lifted, Bitch stares at me with intense hatred.<br/>
Naofumi:"Hey, Bring it."<br/>
If you attack in close proximity I’ll burn you with Wrath Shield.<br/>
Naofumi:"Ah, just Bitch. Hey guys,just watch."<br/>
Woman 1:"Ah, sure……"<br/>
Woman 2:"O-Okay."<br/>
Woman 1 and 2 nod and withdraw.<br/>
Bitch:"I’ll absolutely kill you with this!"<br/>
While glaring at me, Bitch doesn’t even conceal her killing intent and activates her magic.<br/>
"I am the next queen who commands the origin of power. I have read and deciphered a law of nature. Burn him to a crisp with the fires of hell!"<br/>
That magic……Well, it’s an appropriate selection. It’s probably Bitch’s strongest magic.<br/>
Now then, I wonder what magic will shoot out.<br/>
"Doraifa ・Hellfire!"<br/>
Bitch summons a gigantic fireball in front of her.<br/>
Bitch:"Dieeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeee!"<br/>
I prepare my shield to catch the fireball speeding towards me.<br/>
Naofumi:"Are you a retard? Your strongest magic is only this—What!?"<br/>
Bitch:"Uuaaaaaaaaaaaaa!"<br/>
The ball of flame hits my shield and just like a baseball against a bat, it’s shot back at Bitch.<br/>
Until now, fighting in various ways and gaining experience, I have discovered that receiving magic at a specific angle deflects it.<br/>
So I thought it might be possible to reflect it back at the opponent.<br/>
That retard, shooting magic in a straight line, caused me to remember about it.<br/>
Bitch:"St-Stay away——gyaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa!"<br/>
Bitch is swallowed by the flames and throws herself on the ground to roll.<br/>
Naofumi:"Hahaha, you burn well!"<br/>
This is refreshing. Watching Bitch struggle.<br/>
Oh man. I wasn’t content when the queen selfishly imposed penalties.<br/>
Finally I punished her with my own hands.<br/>
Woman2:"Mal…..Bitch-sama!"<br/>
Woman2 casts water magic to put out Bitch.<br/>
Woman2:"Raising your hand against a girl, you are the worst!"<br/>
Naofumi:"You reap what you sow right? She wasn’t even thinking about her magic getting rebounded."<br/>
Woman 2 applies healing magic on Bitch to heal her wounds.<br/>
Well, there’s no way that can be cured easily.<br/>
Shadow:"Now then, I will impose the penalty degojaru."<br/>
Bitch:"GyaaaGuuuuuuuuuuuuu!"<br/>
Bitch rolls over from the double whammy slave crest and the burns.<br/>
Woman2:"Wait a minute, this is too cruel!"<br/>
Shadow:"Punishment is punishment degojaru. Furthermore, I will notify Hero of the Spear-dono to increase the penalties degojaru, Prepare yourself degojaruyo."<br/>
Woman2:"Unbelievable!"<br/>
Naofumi:"Well then, shall we continue hunting?"<br/>
Woman2:"Who would follow you!?"<br/>
Woman2 shoulders Bitch and leaves without permission.<br/>
Naofumi:"Sure. Go away!"<br/>
This was completely her fault. Shadow seems to understand and speaks in a delicate voice.<br/>
Shadow:"The queen expected something like this degojaruga……At least this much."<br/>
Naofumi:"By the way, since they are useless now, shall we kill some time together?’<br/>
Shadow:"……Haah. I understand degojaru. I am a poor substitution, but I will co-operate with Hero of the Shield-dono degojaruyo."<br/>
Naofumi:"Oh? You’re going to help?"<br/>
Shadow:"If such a situation was to happen, I was ordered to assist degojaru."<br/>
Naofumi:"You are quite prepared."<br/>
Could have prevented this from even happening……<br/>
In the first place, was exchanging parties even necessary?<br/>
Woman1:" Hey……"<br/>
My shoulder was tapped as I was talking to shadow.<br/>
Naofumi:"Hm?"<br/>
When I turn around I see Woman 1 with her arms crossed unpleasantly.<br/>
Naofumi:"What’s wrong? You didn’t return?"<br/>
Woman1:"Return? Don’t joke around. That would trouble Motoyasu-sama."<br/>
Naofumi:"Ehh……"<br/>
Somehow she seems to be strong-minded, I don’t think she would return even if she hated it.<br/>
Compared to Bitch and Woman 2, it looks like she has a sense of responsibility,.<br/>
Woman1:" Haah……It was a lot to stand, trying to match up to those children."<br/>
Woman1 declares unpleasantly while scratching her head.<br/>
What’s that?<br/>
Woman1:"Don’t misunderstand alright? I still hate the Hero of the Shield."<br/>
Naofumi:"I was just wondering if you were like those foolish women, you seem to be a bit different."<br/>
Woman1:"……That’s rude. I am honest to myself. I don’t want to fight, and if possible I would like to live luxuriously. The mission of Heroes or the World’s fate doesn’t matter to me."<br/>
Naofumi:"I agree with that."<br/>
If I could I would instantly throw out such a mission. In fact, I would rather not participate in the wave at all.<br/>
Woman1:"Do you understand? If I return here, it would be impossible to live luxuriously."<br/>
Naofumi:"You are very calculative."<br/>
Woman1:"You’re annoying. I love taking it easy in the shadow of someone strong. But that’s it."<br/>
Naofumi:"And what’s the reason for not returning?"<br/>
Woman1:" You are strong as well. Though I hate it, I will follow you."<br/>
Knitting her eyebrows in seriousness Woman 1 answers unpleasantly.<br/>
Woman1:" I do not discriminate against the strong."<br/>
Naofumi:’What strange logic."<br/>
Woman1:"Don’t say that. So what now. I didn’t cause any problems. So my stock with Motoyasu-sama should go up. I would rather not be in the same position as that parasitic princess."<br/>
I see.<br/>
They exist in my world as well. This fellow.<br/>
The women getting involved in delinquent groups in school, following those who are strong. Probably.<br/>
Following the leader around, receiving the overflow.<br/>
Generally the types to think in the long-term and take it easy.<br/>
Since I am Japanese, I can understand to some extent.<br/>
Woman1:"I think that former princess would abandon Motoyasu-sama at a suitable time. I don’t think Motoyasu-sama likes troublesome women, and there will be a limit to how much he can cherish women."<br/>
There is a possibility that Motoyasu would trust those that didn’t cause problems over the ones that do.<br/>
As for Motoyasu’s part, Bitch seems to be at the top of the pecking order.<br/>
Is she aiming for an usurpation?<br/>
Woman1:" My father is a noble who earned his rank by distinguishing himself in the military, and my mother is the daughter of a merchant who made a fortune in business. When you haggled to buy that accessory I was amazed. Though it is the worse to haggle using blackmail when buying something for a girl."<br/>
Naofumi:"Yeah yeah."<br/>
Let’s just disregard it, because I’m getting angry just remembering.<br/>
Woman1:"I also understand the point of this. I will analyse how the Hero of the Shield fights and report to Motoyasu-sama everything."<br/>
Naofumi:"……You really are aiming for being the best."<br/>
Woman1:"Let’s leave it at that. Let’s resume hunting quickly."<br/>
I have no choice but to change my evaluation of Woman 1.<br/>
She is calculating, but unlike Bitch she doesn’t seem to gain pleasure from looking down on others.<br/>
I’m thinking about Bitch again.<br/>
I feel she can be trusted in business. I don’t want to trust as a friend though.<br/>
Naofumi:"Well the headcount is the same as before. Shadow, do you accept?"<br/>
Shadow:"I understand degojaruyo……"<br/>
I send a party invitation to Shadow and remove Woman 2 and Bitch. Thus we resume our demon extermination.<br/>
Woman 1 was a magic warrior so she could fight up close or far away.<br/>
Shadow is a very swift attacker. As expected of this country’s assassination corps, quite strong.<br/>
By the way, they are not slaves so I cannot see their status or levels, so I can’t tell what level they are.<br/>
Woman1:" You really are sturdy. I am surprised at how different you fight compared to Motoyasu-sama."<br/>
Woman 1 says while defeating a demon.<br/>
From the conversation a while ago, I know that they only cheer on Motoyasu from the rear.<br/>
Woman1:" However…… That Raccoon woman is reliable."<br/>
Raccoon woman……Raphtalia?<br/>
If she hears that then she would probably make a delicate expression.<br/>
By the way, Woman 1 is good at using me as a shield.<br/>
She observes the demons well, and uses adjusts in battle, she is accustomed to fighting.<br/>
The way she is pushing everything on me while fighting is pretty efficient, compared to Raphtalia and Firo who try to do everything themselves.<br/>
It’s not a good feeling when pressed against a demon though.<br/>
However, she is not as good at ranged, she is distracted while chanting magic. Shadow had to defend her several times.<br/>
Demons are defeated, dismantled, and absorbed into the shield.<br/>
Woman1:"Hooh…… You can absorb the dismantled demons into your weapon?"<br/>
Naofumi:"Motoyasu doesn’t know about it?"<br/>
Woman1:"He doesn’t do it usually. Only on big game, like a Chimera or a strong demon."<br/>
Motoyasu should have absorbed some demon parts into his spear…….Does he not bother with meat and bone?<br/>
But, that doesn’t really make sense.<br/>
I have unsealed most of the basic shields. Therefore, my ability has risen considerably.<br/>
The Meat system is inferior to the Bone system if released.<br/>
That must be why I cannot beat Motoyasu unless I use the Wrath Shield.<br/>
Of course, it could also be due to the fact that I started leveling late, but I can feel the difference between Motoyasu and my basic specs.<br/>
The same could be said for Ren and Itsuki.<br/>
It is funny that I thought the shield was weak a while ago.<br/>
At least in present conditions, the shield isn’t inferior to any of the other weapons.<br/>
Or is it because in-game terms, we are still in the early stages?<br/>
……I don’t know.<br/>
Naofumi:"Oh right, there was something I wanted to ask."<br/>
Woman1:"What is it?"<br/>
Naofumi:"Were you Motoyasu’s first party member?"<br/>
For some reason that memory is very vague.<br/>
But if I remember correctly, then it wasn’t her.<br/>
Woman1:"No I’m not."<br/>
Naofumi:"Ah, is that so?"<br/>
Woman1:"I joined Motoyasu-sama one week after I started adventuring. When I entered the only other man in the party left."<br/>
Naofumi:" I see."<br/>
Woman1:"The former princess and her lackey tormented him until he left. Anyone who joined after me was antagonized."<br/>
I see, if you don’t pretend to be stupid then Bitch would torment you until you disappear.<br/>
What an unpleasant party managed by women.<br/>
Are real harems like that?<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
