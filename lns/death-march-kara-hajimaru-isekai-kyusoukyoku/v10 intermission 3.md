<br/>
Intermission: The Adventure of Ninja Tama<br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
I check the pink ninja clothes that Master's made for me in front of the mirror.<br/>
<br/>
Un, cute~<br/>
<br/>
I wanted to show off to Pochi, but I couldn't find her anywhere.<br/>
Seems she's gone playing first thing in the morning~<br/>
<br/>
"Tama-chan, here are your lunch box and snacks for today."<br/>
"Sankyu~ Vary ma~"<br/>
<br/>
I'm so happy, I hold the lunch box set Lulu's made up above and spin merrily.<br/>
Today must be a good day too nyan.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
◇<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
I'm patrolling the city again today.<br/>
Because, ninjas are destined to live in the shadow, I'll watch over the city's peace from the background.<br/>
<br/>
Ah, it's dragonflies!<br/>
I chase after the dragonflies flying on the streamlet from the side, pyon pyon.<br/>
<br/>
I wave my hands toward the oba-chans doing laundry, and the one~san holding a baby.<br/>
Everyone happily waved back at me.<br/>
<br/>
Huh? Ninjas shouldn't have been seen.<br/>
Well, it's fine~<br/>
<br/>
Ah, an old-man is being bullied!<br/>
Wait for me~ Ninja Tama, will go now~<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
◇<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
"Please wait! I can't continue my business if you take those!"<br/>
"We can sell her to the slave trader right?"<br/>
"Father! Help!"<br/>
"Ah, please forgive my daughter!"<br/>
<br/>
Um~mm, these hoodlum people are bad people?<br/>
Complicated~?<br/>
<br/>
"Hah! I'll let you off with these cooking tools and your daughter today!"<br/>
"Why, my debt should only be one silver coin!"<br/>
"There's this thing called interest! It's 100 gold coins now!"<br/>
"No way, even usury has a limit!"<br/>
<br/>
Gold coins? Nyu~n?<br/>
I got one gold coin from Master this morning, but it's not enough.<br/>
<br/>
Ah, they started beating the old man with sticks.<br/>
The Onee-san is crying!<br/>
<br/>
Crying is not good!<br/>
<br/>
"Tenshil! Chisil!　Miracurun! The mysterious ninja Tama appears!"<br/>
<br/>
Oh right, I'll use ninjutsu here!<br/>
<br/>
"Ninja art, Uchisemi no Jutsu~"<br/>
<TLN: Should've been "Utsusemi no Jutsu". Uchi means house.><br/>
<br/>
I changed the fainted hoodlums' with clothed logs in their places.<br/>
Leaving the logs, together with the hoodlum people to the roof, I ju~mp.<br/>
<br/>
Err, I quickly tie the hoodlum people, and then throw them away to the back alley.<br/>
Spinspin~ spin, and poi.<br/>
<br/>
"Eh?　The people from the Avarice Fox are gone?"<br/>
<br/>
I secretly land beside the surprised Onee-san.<br/>
<br/>
"Aku, soku, zazan!"<br/>
<TLN: From Aku, soku, zan. Lit. evil, immediately, slain.><br/>
<br/>
I'm triumphant while taking the victory pose.<br/>
Onee-san opens her mouth and hardens. Insects would go in you know?<br/>
<br/>
"I exterminated them~ degozaru."<br/>
"T, thank you."<br/>
"You're wlcome~, nin nin."<br/>
<br/>
Are you going to leave the old man behind you like that?<br/>
When I tilt my head and look at the old man, the Onee-san finally notices it.<br/>
<br/>
"That's right!　Father, hold on!"<br/>
"Let him drink thiss~ degozaru."<br/>
<br/>
Potion is the best for injuries you know?<br/>
They were surprised after he drank the potion from Master.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
◇<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
In the park near the Ivy Mansion, I've a lunch.<br/>
U~n, there are a lot of greeneries here, I like it very much.<br/>
It's the next best after Master's lap.<br/>
<br/>
If there was a short ear rabbit, I'd have chased and play with it.<br/>
<br/>
Huh? Someone is coming.<br/>
<br/>
Tama leaves a doll on the ground, and climbs to the top of a tree.<br/>
Because, I'm a ninja.<br/>
<br/>
"Found you! It's you right! The one who beat up the third."<br/>
"Hey hey, what's wrong? Isn't she too scared she can't even turn around?"<br/>
"Gyahahaha~, We're the Avarice Fox gang who make children run away crying after all!"<br/>
<br/>
Err, fat flag? Diet is hard you know?<br/>
The hoodlum people stab the doll with their swords and talk in loud voice.<br/>
<br/>
They will notice soon?<br/>
When I don't have turn like this, it feels a bit, irritating.<br/>
<br/>
"The hell is this? It's a doll!"<br/>
"Damn, she ran away!"<br/>
<br/>
Ah, they're looking around.<br/>
They also look at the trees' tops, but they don't notice Tama. Because ninjas can't be seen.<br/>
<br/>
It's about time for the windmill to appear!<br/>
I take out a windmill from my pouch and throw it to the hoodlums below.<br/>
<br/>
Eyy.<br/>
<br/>
"Uwahh, aniki! Aniki isss!"<br/>
<br/>
Huh?<br/>
The hoodlums became squashed under the windmill.<br/>
<br/>
Strange~, Arisa said that it was windmill for time like this.<br/>
<br/>
"Why is a windmill in a place like this!"<br/>
"Oy, you alive?"<br/>
<br/>
Are windmills and pinwheels different?<br/>
Evidence destruction~?<br/>
<br/>
I collect the windmill with the whip sword and put it into the pouch.<br/>
<br/>
"Ah, that pink guy is on such a place!"<br/>
"Oy, shoulder aniki, let's run."<br/>
<br/>
Ah, they ran away.<br/>
I have to chase them! Because, they're running away!<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
◇<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
I jump from shadow to shadow while eating a potato and chasing the hoodlums.<br/>
This potato is delicious. I'll give half to Pochi.<br/>
Since I'll likely eat them all, I wrap the remaining potato and put it into the pouch.<br/>
<br/>
"Boss!　The pink monster is attacking!"<br/>
"What'd you say! Get Sensei here."<br/>
"Ey."<br/>
<br/>
The hoodlum people are holding hatchets and bone clubs, I take it off their hands and hit them, take it off and hit them.<br/>
Holding back to prevent them hurting badly is hard.<br/>
<br/>
"She's too strong."<br/>
"Is Sensei's not here yet!"<br/>
<br/>
Two people left.<br/>
A bearded old man and a thin old man who've only been ordering around with loud voices without doing anything since awhile ago.<br/>
<br/>
"Mou, I was still in the middle of eating the meat skewers nodesu! Punpun nanodesu!"<br/>
<br/>
A samurai wearing haori hakama came out from the back!<br/>
Samurais are the rival of Ninjas!<br/>
<br/>
Her face seen from her hood looks similar to Pochi, but Pochi's name is not Sensei, so it's a different person.<br/>
<br/>
"The bodyguard of justice, Kin-san the bum nanodesu!"<br/>
<TLN: A bum samurai wearing haori... Good thing it's not 'Gin' huh? ;) ><br/>
"Mysterious ninja~?"<br/>
<br/>
Her real nature is a mystery.<br/>
<br/>
Kin-san pulls out a Japanese katana and sets it up.<br/>
<br/>
"The way of full moon nanodesu!"<br/>
"Falling leaves~?"<br/>
<br/>
I cut the coming red Magic Edge Cannon's halo with the ninja katanas on both my hands. I avoided two out of three, they flew and broke the wall behind. They'll get mad at you, you know?<br/>
<br/>
To be able to use Magic Edge Cannon like Pochi and Liza, Kin-san is strong.<br/>
<br/>
"My turn~?"<br/>
<br/>
Using Bunshin no Jutsu, I split into three and attack in three directions.<br/>
<br/>
"Amazing nodesu! As expected of a ninja nanodesu!"<br/>
<br/>
Mumwu, she's moving fast like Pochi's Flickering Movement, attacking the bunshin.<br/>
Foul play~?<br/>
<br/>
"If it's three people, then I just have to attack with triple the speed nodesu!"<br/>
"It's the real body this time tough~?"<br/>
<br/>
From the ceiling, I randomly shoot shurikens.<br/>
I occasionally grab onto the ceiling, and make a feint.<br/>
<br/>
"It's no big deal if it doesn't hit nodesu!"<br/>
<br/>
All of them are swayed by her Japanese sword.<br/>
<br/>
Amazing, amazing!　There's a girl this strong besides Pochi.<br/>
I'll tell about it to Pochi later.<br/>
<br/>
"I'm settling it with the next move nodesu!"<br/>
"Me too, certain kill technique~?"<br/>
<br/>
Certain kill is written hissatsu (必殺).<br/>
Certainly not kill is 必生 (hitsunama?). Arisa told me that.<br/>
<br/>
"Magic Edge Rush (Vorpal Lance)!"<br/>
"Magic Edge Twin Fangs (Vanquish Fang)."<br/>
<br/>
The Samurai whose whole body shines red shouts the killer technique's name.<br/>
She understood the promise well~<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
◇<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
"Alright, stop there."<br/>
<br/>
Huh?<br/>
I've been caught and lifted lightly.<br/>
I look up, and there's Master.<br/>
<br/>
"Master~?"<br/>
"Master nanodesu!"<br/>
<br/>
Huhuh?<br/>
I take off the ninja costume's hood and look at Kin-san.<br/>
She also took off her hood like me.<br/>
<br/>
"Pochii!"<br/>
"Tama nanodesu!"<br/>
<br/>
Now wonder she's strong, nyan.<br/>
<br/>
People who came from behind Master are tying up the hoodlum people.<br/>
<br/>
"Well then, Captain-san, I'm counting on you to deal with these people."<br/>
"Yes, Chevalier-sama."<br/>
<br/>
It's the sentry Captain-san!<br/>
This person often treats me to a lot of meat from the food stalls.<br/>
While being lifted by Master, I greet him with 'shupin' pose.<br/>
<br/>
"Why are you arresting me!"<br/>
"All you guys' deeds have been investigated by Marquis-sama's intelligence. In addition, since you were smuggling the necessary ingredients for Fiend Drug's production, you're charged with treason. Don't think you can defend it."<br/>
<br/>
Complicated~ Make the explanation shorter!<br/>
While handing the potato from before to Pochi, I tell Master and Pochi my remarkable activities today.<br/>
