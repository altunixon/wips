Chapter 2: A Guest in Forest’s Edge<br/>
<br/>

<br/>
<br/>

The next day, when I appeared in the Wu clan village with my wagon, a small commotion occurred.<br/>
I already informed Lala Wu and the others, so I was mentally prepared for this incident. The children cheered at my arrival, which scared me a little. But thankfully, no one cast any accusatory gaze my way.<br/>
Before entering the plaza of the village, I pulled the reins to make Gilulu stop. I then got off the driver’s platform and continued on foot.<br/>
"Welcome to the Wu clan, Asuta. So you learned to drive the wagon in just one day."<br/>
Shela Wu ran over from Shin Wu’s house that was in front of the Wu clan main house.<br/>
"Yes. Ai Fa trained together with me this morning too, so I learned the fundamental skills. If I drive slowly down the path to town, it will be fine."<br/>
And the price of that was Ai Fa chopping wood and foraging herbs alone.<br/>
I felt apologetic towards her because Ai Fa wasn’t too interested in driving the wagon. She only helped me with my training after I invited her earnestly.<br/>
After finishing the training, Ai Fa got off the wagon reluctantly when it was time to go to the Wu clan.<br/>
"From today onwards, I will pick up everyone with my wagon. First will be loading the cargo from Shela Wu’s place… But since there is a wagon now, I won’t need to borrow a pot anymore."<br/>
After I bought a griddle, we had to go through a bit of hassle; I needed to put the tarapa sauce into pouches, meet up with Shela Wu at the Post Station Town, and then transfer the sauce into the pot she brought over. It would be difficult for Vena Wu and me to carry both the griddle and the pot, so we had to do it this way.<br/>
But now, I could bring as many things as I needed directly from the Fa house. The wagon had a pot full of tarapa sauce, the griddle for "Myam-roasted meat", 60 meat patties, 60 grilled poitan, 90 slices of meat marinated in the sauce. Also included were the meat for the inns and 2 kg of jerky.<br/>
That was quite a large number of things.<br/>
Aside from the griddle, Vena Wu and I needed to carry that many things.<br/>
It served as fine physical training, but I felt really happy that I didn’t need to bring all these things across that dangerous suspension bridge.<br/>
Anyway, I loaded the 90 grilled poitan made by Shela Wu onto the wagon and set off for the main house.<br/>
Over there, Rimee Wu and the Wu clan’s Totos, Lulu, were waiting for me.<br/>
"Uwah, a wagon! Amazing, Asuta!"<br/>
I walked towards Rimee Wu who was mounted on Lulu. This girl who liked Totos as much as Ai Fa started training on riding a Totos so early in the morning.<br/>
"Amazing, amazing! But it looks so heavy, thank you for your hard work, Gilulu!"<br/>
And of course, Gilulu just tilted its head with a dumb expression.<br/>
Lulu also stared blankly at Gilulu.<br/>
"Ah, Asuta. Welcome to the Wu clan. That’s all the firewood for today."<br/>
Mama Mia Lei who came out of the house after hearing the noise outside laughed heartily.<br/>
Leina Wu and Lala Wu carried a large amount of firewood out from the back of the house, and we were all set.<br/>
"Let’s go then; everyone, get on the wagon."<br/>
Leina Wu, Lala Wu, and Shela Wu climbed on board noisily.<br/>
I glanced at them through the corner of my eyes and then asked Mama Mia Lei: "Erm, Vena Wu hasn’t recovered yet?"<br/>
"That’s right. Even if you ferry her over in a wagon, she can’t stand for the entire day. Like I told you right from the start, it would be three days before she can work in town again."<br/>
"Is that so? Then, what about the matter with the easterner Shumimaru?"<br/>
"Well, we have decided to invite him over for now. After the clan head and I meet this guest, we will think about letting him see Vena Wu."<br/>
"I see. I can vouch that he is a trustworthy man. I will be in your care then."<br/>
I breathed a sigh of relief and led Gilulu to the exit of the plaza.<br/>
The wagon started rolling, and the girls on board started squealing.<br/>
"Let us be off. It will be a little shaky, so be careful not to fall off."<br/>
I sat on the driver’s platform and hit the base of Gilulu’s leg with the whip.<br/>
Gilulu started walking briskly. Even with so much load, its stride remained nimble as ever.<br/>
It was still early, so I decided to let Gilulu walk at a normal pace instead of trotting.<br/>
It would take 40 to 50 minutes to walk from the Wu clan village to the Post Station Town, but a Totos walking speed could cover that distance in ten to twenty-five minutes… Even when traversing a meandering road, it would take 30 minutes at most. We could reach earlier than usual just by driving safely.<br/>
"Asuta, is it fine for our wage to be the same even though you are taking care of us so much? I feel a little bad about this."<br/>
Shela Wu’s voice came from behind.<br/>
There wasn’t anything dividing the driver’s platform from the wagon, so we could still talk freely if we raised our voices a little.<br/>
"It’s fine. The work will only start after we reach the Post Station Town, so please don’t mind what happens before and after that too much."<br/>
"I see, but the traveling time got shortened greatly. We can gather more firewood if we reach home early."<br/>
I smiled gently; Shela Wu was a serious girl.<br/>
But I changed the topic.<br/>
"We already have enough firewood. Shela Wu, would you like to do some other work?"<br/>
"Other work? Like what?"<br/>
As we turned a corner on the Forest’s Edge road, I raised up a proposal I had been thinking about for quite some time:<br/>
"Like making the meat patty for "Kiba burger" and tarapa sauce… or cutting the meat for "Myam-roasted meat" and its sauce. I’m thinking of handing one of these works to you, what do you think?"<br/>
Shela Wu seemed a little troubled and stayed quiet.<br/>
And I just waited patiently for her answer.<br/>
"But… If we interfere too much, there will be less way for Asuta to perform…?"<br/>
"True, but that is my objective. It might take some time to do so, but I have been thinking about completely handing one of the stalls over to the Wu clan."<br/>
Silence again.<br/>
I continued:<br/>
"I have had this idea for a long time now. I signed contracts with innkeepers, prepared the dishes, and ensured the taste and quality was up to standard. I then made a profit after deducting the cost of the ingredients and stall rental. If you can do all this without me, then the earnings from that stall will belong to the Wu clan."<br/>
"…"<br/>
"I had not discussed this with Donda Wu yet, and I don’t plan to rush this too. But as a precondition, I hope you all can learn how to prepare these dishes… What do you think?"<br/>
"B-But… why? Doing this will just reduce the copper plates earned by the Fa house and won’t benefit Asuta at all, correct…?"<br/>
Shela Wu’s voice was trembling.<br/>
A gust of wind brushed across my face, and I couldn’t help smiling.<br/>
"That’s not true. If I hand one stall over to the Wu clan, my job will be much easier. I can also expand my business in other ways… In order to do so, I need to work hard in studying and research."<br/>
"Studying and research…?"<br/>
"That’s right. If things go well, I can cater food for more inns. Even if I can’t do that, I’m still planning to update the menu. The cooking time for "Braised kiba" is too long, and a dish that uses pickled Chitto costs too much."<br/>
"Hmm…"<br/>
"I’m also thinking about new dishes for the stall. Right now, we have 90 portions of "Myam-roasted meat" and 60 portions of "Kiba burger", a total of 150 dishes every day. But there are about ten leftover "Myam-roasted meat" every day, correct? Then it would be better to reduce the number of "Kiba burger" and "Myam-roasted meat" to 50 or 60 each and introduce a third dish."<br/>
"Ah, you want to expand to 3 stalls?"<br/>
"Not really, this is just a thought. No matter what, I don’t want to increase the workload right now, given the situation. I will give it serious thought after handing one of the stalls over to the Wu clan."<br/>
Considering the cost of the venue, stall rental and manpower, increasing the number of stalls would just reduce the profits. However, I planned to introduce new dishes slowly while continuing to offer the popular items.<br/>
If each of the three dishes could sell more than 60 portions, it would fulfill the objective of letting more people eating kiba. Another thing to consider was whether we could compete with the other stalls if we sold 180 portions in three stalls, instead of 150 portions in two stalls.<br/>
Anyway, our goal in selling kiba dishes wasn’t to earn money but to promote the deliciousness of kiba— selling not just dishes, but also kiba meat. This was a grandiose plan and also an exhibition of our merchandise.<br/>
"Like I said, I don’t plan to push this plan ahead quickly. This business has been running for just a month. With how turbulent the times are, we have to exercise caution… However, I don’t think the handing a stall over to the Wu clan will be that hard since I have seen the work everyone has done."<br/>
If the Wu clan could run the business on their own, the goal of bringing prosperity to the Forest’s Edge would persevere even if I was gone… It was one of the reasons I had this idea.<br/>
No one knew when they would die. This was common sense in this world, and I might be gone at any moment too. So taking measures to prepare for that wasn’t a bad thing.<br/>
This might be one of the reason, but it wasn’t the biggest one.<br/>
One month ago, on the fifth day of my business, this thought came to me naturally when Shela Wu came to help me out. If Shela Wu was this capable, could I hand a stall over to her? So I was just saying what I had been thinking about for the past month.<br/>
Mama Mia Lei also asked me in surprise about why I always choose the route where I stand to lose out. However, the objective of the Fa house was bringing prosperity to the Forest’s Edge. Ai Fa’s intention wasn’t to gather all the wealth within the Fa house.<br/>
If this was a job that only I could do, I would give it my all. But if others could manage it, then letting them take over to free me up for other tasks would be the most effective way.<br/>
And those who were capable should be rewarded accordingly. Shela Wu had such a qualification.<br/>
"Erm… But, I…"<br/>
"I think there is no problem with your cooking skills. You have been in charge of the tarapa sauce all this time, Shela Wu, and you are good at making the meat patty for the burgers, right? The most important thing in doing business is to keep the taste the same. I plan to train you on this too."<br/>
"..."<br/>
"By comparison, the "Myam-roasted meat" is easier to make, correct? Once you learn how to cut the meat, the rest is easy… But, honestly speaking, I would prefer you to learn the more complicated "Kiba burger"."<br/>
"It’s fine! I’m good at making "Kiba burgers"!"<br/>
A voice answered firmly in a tone, different from Shela Wu.<br/>
I could already guess that was Leina Wu.<br/>
"Asuta, your myam dish has a stronger taste to suit the preferences of the townsfolk, correct? If so, it might be better to let the Wu clan handle the "Kiba burgers". It will be difficult for us to make a dish we don’t like ourselves."<br/>
"Oh, that makes sense."<br/>
"I think it will be hard for Shela Wu to have the resolve to replace Asuta. It’s hard for me to do so either. But If I work together with Shela Wu… we can at least be half as good as Asuta."<br/>
"You think too highly of me. With your powers combined, you can make a dish that exceeds my capabilities."<br/>
"… Asuta, it’s you who thinks too highly of us."<br/>
Leina Wu continued answering in a firm tone.<br/>
"Sorry, Shela Wu, I have been the only one talking all the while, but I really want to give it a try… and see just how far I can go. If it works, not only can I earn copper plates, I will have the honor of being a chef just like Asuta, right?"<br/>
"Honor, as a chef…"<br/>
Shela Wu spoke softly, but she was no longer quivering like before.<br/>
Only the sound of the wagon rolling along could be heard… When we reached a bend where we could see the road leading into the Post Station Town, Shela Wu finally spoke:<br/>
"… Will Asuta guide us on what we are lacking?"<br/>
"Yes, of course."<br/>
"Then… I want to test my abilities."<br/>
I answered: "Thank you very much." with gratitude and then pulled Gilulu’s reins to slow it down.<br/>
Nothing of note happened after reaching the Post Station Town.<br/>
We were permitted to park the Totos at the empty space behind the stall. But the Totos would eat the surrounding vegetation when it was tied up, so we needed to pay an additional 2 red copper plates of venue rental.<br/>
The stall rental was 1 red copper plate per day, but the fee for parking the Totos was twice of that amount. The pricing did seem queer to me, but since the rental was cheap in the first place, I had no complaints. Leaving it in a proper Totos stable for half a day would cost 3 red copper plates, so the price here was more reasonable.<br/>
Anyway, business was good.<br/>
The southerners and easterners started queuing early in the morning, and when that wave left, the westerners started coming slowly. The southerners and easterners each made up 40% of my patrons, and the rest were westerners. This ratio was still the same.<br/>
Despite that commotion, the number of patrons remains the same. I’m really grateful to my customers…<br/>
However, things were still a little troublesome.<br/>
Especially the western customers.<br/>
During this month, the easterners and southerners had mostly changed. There weren’t many of them staying in the Post Station Town long term like the Silver Vase and Pop’s architects.<br/>
But there were those who visited Genos after hearing rave reviews about the 《Big Tree of the South Inn》 and the 《Cryptic Venerable Inn》, who did in turn patronize my stall. This trend was even more obvious after I started catering for the inns.<br/>
On the other hand, the westerners were always the same few people. Some of them came from another town to work here, but the permanent residents were the majority.<br/>
Which meant, the 30-odd westerners that visited the stall daily were all regulars.<br/>
I had no idea how many westerners lived in Genos’ Post Station Town, but I recalled that Ai Fa said there were a few thousand. However, that was just outdated second-hand info.<br/>
Judging from how developed the streets were and the number of residential buildings, I would estimate there to be about a thousand to two thousand residents. It wasn’t to the extent of ten thousand, but a few thousand people was an appropriate way of putting it.<br/>
And of course, not all the residents in the Post Station Town would buy their meal in the marketplace. The customers were mainly travelers and people working nearby. Some of them dined at the inns too.<br/>
There were tens of food stalls in this vast marketplace— more than 50, maybe even 60 or 70.<br/>
I heard the sales for a stall was 20 to 50 portions a day, which was about 35 on average.<br/>
Assuming there were 60 stalls, multiplied by 35, that would be 2,100 people. And my two stalls garnered around 140 patrons a day, which was quite a substantial number.<br/>
So the problem was still the ratio of customers.<br/>
From the pedestrians traveling on the streets, the majority was westerners, making up 60 to 70 percent of the crowd.<br/>
Of the 2,100 estimated customers, at least 1,260 were westerners.<br/>
Less than 30 visited my stalls, which was below 2.46 percent.<br/>
Only that many westerners visited my stall unreservedly.<br/>
In contrast, of the 840 foreigners, 110 patronized my stall. That was 13 percent.<br/>
One out of every ten easterners or southerners visited my stall.<br/>
Only 2 out of every hundred westerners patronized my shop.<br/>
No matter how well my business was doing, this was the reality my stall was facing.<br/>
On top of this huge gulf, that commotion happened ten days ago. Even so, there were still many people who didn’t desert denizens of Forest’s Edge and continued buying kiba dishes from us. This was great, but I still didn’t know how to proceed.<br/>
… Well, I worry about this too much, that’s why Ai Fa thinks I’m very anxious.<br/>
As my thoughts wandered astray, someone tugged the waist of my T-shirt.<br/>
"Asuta, are you okay? There’s a customer."<br/>
Leina Wu who was tending to the "Kiba burger" stall with me looked up at my face worriedly.<br/>
I nodded at her and tapped my cheeks lightly.<br/>
"Sorry, I was thinking about something… Sorry, and welcome."<br/>
But my smile froze at this moment.<br/>
A beardless southerner was standing before me with a blank expression.<br/>
"Ah, hello… How may I help you?"<br/>
Leina Wu didn’t seem to notice that this was Lavis who visited the stall yesterday.<br/>
"I’m here to purchase your food. Will you still sell them to me, despite what happened yesterday?"<br/>
His face looked unhappy, but his tone and attitude were sincere.<br/>
I looked around me, confirmed that mischevious girl wasn’t around, and then answered: "Of course."<br/>
"I was in the wrong yesterday too. So, one portion for you?"<br/>
"Yes."<br/>
"But the dish here has a stranger taste then yesterday’s dish, and the texture is more unique. Some southerners don’t like this taste and texture, so would you like a sample before buying it?"<br/>
There were a lot less customers trying the samples now, and, if someone wanted a sample, I had to sacrifice some of my merchandise, which couldn’t be helped. The two red copper plates used to draw in new customers was a necessary expense.<br/>
But the young man seemed irritated when he heard what I said.<br/>
"Is that so… Is the taste of this dish that heavy?"<br/>
"Yes, but there are southerners who like this dish. But on the whole, the southerners prefer the myam dish over there."<br/>
The young man tilted his thick neck and pondered aloud: "What should I do…?"<br/>
"Well, even if you ask me…": I gasped mid-way through my sentence.<br/>
From behind the stout body of the southerner young man, a head with uneven brown hair and beautiful green eyes poked out.<br/>
"Ah, so you are here too. Erm… Apologies for what I said yesterday, I’m very sorry."<br/>
I took off the towel on my head and lowered my head about 30 degrees.<br/>
The southerner girl Dell glared at me with her left eye.<br/>
"What should we do? Want to try a sample?"<br/>
The young was about to turn back.<br/>
The girl suddenly yelled: "Idiot! Don’t move! He will see me!"<br/>
"Erm, you already showed yourself, so why are you still hiding…?"<br/>
I pointed out gently, and the small visible patch of pale skin around her eyes reddened.<br/>
"… Aren’t you angry?"<br/>
"What?"<br/>
"I hit you twice yesterday, Asuta, aren’t you angry?"<br/>
"Well, I did offend you in the first place. I don’t agree with violence, but I was in the wrong, so I’m not angry."<br/>
I didn’t show a kind and gentle smile, but still answered her manneredly. And it was true that I wasn’t mad.<br/>
"… Are you really not angry?"<br/>
"Yes, I’m not."<br/>
"… But I’m still angry."<br/>
"Ah, erm, I’m very sorry. I’m reflecting on it."<br/>
"… Do you still think I’m a boy?"<br/>
"I wouldn’t dare! I thought there are no southerner girls in Genos. I’m reflecting on my actions, can you forgive me?"<br/>
My coercion probably worked, and that girl finally walked out from behind that young man.<br/>
She was as petite as ever, with a slim figure and cute appearance. If I knew right from the start, I would definitely see her as a girl. I couldn’t help wondering why the idea that she was a "boy that is as cute as a girl" appeared on my mind. Human psychology was hard to fathom.<br/>
If I was to say, she should have dressed more femininely if she didn’t want others to mistake her for a boy. Her sleeveless shirt and pants were just like the young man’s beside her, and the colors were plain too.<br/>
Be it the denizens of Forest’s Edge or westerners, the women all had feminine attire and extravagant accessories and showed a lot of skin. This girl’s body didn’t look very thicc, but if she dressed the part, she would definitely be cute enough to turn the heads of everyone who saw her.<br/>
"… That person is really a beauty."<br/>
Dell looked at Leina Wu with serious eyes.<br/>
Leina Wu showed a troubled smile, tilted her head, and said: "What’s the matter?"<br/>
"That person is pretty too, and the red-haired girl is cute as well. Are there a lot of beauties in Forest’s Edge?"<br/>
"Well, it’s hard to dispute that fact."<br/>
"… With so many beauties around you, someone like me will naturally be thought of as a boy."<br/>
"Not at all! You are very cute too and won’t lose to them at all."<br/>
I answered on reflex.<br/>
In the end, Dell’s fair face turned beet red, while Leina Wu narrowed her round eyes coldly, just like my house head.<br/>
"A-Are you stupid? You can’t say that even if you don’t want to upset me, or you will lose your credibility, you know? Asuta, you are really insensitive!"<br/>
"Yes, I hate myself sometimes too… Anyway, if you don’t mind what happened and are willing to try the sample, please do! I will cut the sample now…"<br/>
"There is no need for sampling… Will you really sell it to me?"<br/>
"Do I have any reason not to? I’m glad that you are willing to buy from me."<br/>
With her face still red, Dell happily… really happily, smiled bashfully.<br/>
The moment I saw her smile, the last bit of grudge in my heart faded away. This girl might be a little mischievous in her words and actions, but she could face her emotions head on. If I had to describe her as examples using the people I knew around me, she was similar to Lala Wu.<br/>
And so… a smile on this sort of people was very charming. It reminded me of the first time Pops Balan smiled.<br/>
"Then sell it to me! How many copper plates?"<br/>
"Thank you for your patronage. Two red copper plates, please."<br/>
"So cheap! Can you even break even like this?"<br/>
"Yes, this is on par with the other stalls."<br/>
After Ai Fa started hunting again, I didn’t need to procure kiba meat from the other houses. The operation cost dropped drastically, but the other conditions remained the same as at the other stalls.<br/>
By the way, the meat today wasn’t bought from the Wu clan, but the Lan house. The price wasn’t 12 red copper plates for one kiba, but 120 copper plates. After Zwei spoke with Mama Mia Lei, I finally corrected the price of the meat.<br/>
The price was between 100 and 140 red copper plates, depending on the size of the kiba. Half a kiba would be half the price. Unlike the Wu clan which hunted several kiba a day, the smaller houses had to think carefully about how much they needed to eat.<br/>
"Then give me one! Lavis, are you really not eating?"<br/>
"Yes. I ate a light meal before leaving the mansion."<br/>
The young man took out a pouch from his waist, fished out one white copper plate, and placed it on the counter with a thud.<br/>
"Thank you for your patronage, your change is 8 red copper plates."<br/>
While I was making the "Kiba burger", Leina Wu handled the change.<br/>
But when Leina Wu handed the money over, Lavis showed no reaction.<br/>
Leina Wu seemed to notice something and then nodded before placing the copper plates on the counter. That young man then picked up the 8 red copper plates wordlessly.<br/>
He wanted to avoid touching the hands of the denizens of Forest’s Edge, huh.<br/>
When the denizens of Forest’s Edge moved from the Jaguar jungle into the Genos, they switched their belief from the southern god to the western god. There were still some Jaguar people who used this as an excuse to ostracize the denizens of Forest’s Edge.<br/>
But the number of southerners who thought this way was in the minority and didn’t approach the stall in the first place. So this was a rare situation.<br/>
Hmm… They aren’t bad guys, but it’s hard to deal with them.<br/>
I thought this as I handed the prepared "Kiba burger" to Dell.<br/>
"Sorry for the wait. Be careful not to spill the tarapa sauce."<br/>
"Yes, thank you!"<br/>
She was completely in a good mood and was all smiles.<br/>
Unlike yesterday, she bit into her meal without hesitation and squinted blissfully.<br/>
"It tastes really good! There’s no need to sample after all! It’s as good as the dish yesterday, Asuta!"<br/>
"Thank you, I’m happy to hear you say that."<br/>
"But this meat is a little soft. Is this kiba?"<br/>
"Yes, I made it by mincing the meat and melding them together before grilling it."<br/>
"Hmm, this is great. To think that there are proper dishes in the Post Station Town too."<br/>
Proper dishes, huh.<br/>
I felt a bit curious after hearing that.<br/>
"Erm, what do you really usually eat in the city? Are there extravagant dishes beyond that of the Post Station Town?"<br/>
"Hmm? How should I put it, the food is completely different…! But Asuta’s cooking is great too. Why is a meal that costs 2 red copper plates so good?"<br/>
She took another bite of the "Kiba burger" gleefully.<br/>
"This diced vegetable is tino, right? And the one inside the pot is tarapa, correct? Cheap tarapa is sour, but this one is sweet and yummy."<br/>
"Huh? There are tarapa which aren’t sour? I cooked it together with diced aria to neutralize the sourness and also seasoned it with fruit wine and myam."<br/>
"Fruit wine, huh. But that’s just cheap stuff too, right?"<br/>
"Fruit wine is cheap. A bottle like this is just one red copper plate."<br/>
"One red copper plate! It’s laughably cheap!!"<br/>
How incredibly arrogant.<br/>
It was probably her nature to not have second thoughts about her words. I felt complicated about her praising the food but criticizing the ingredients.<br/>
"However, you made delicious food with cheap ingredients, which shows how high Asuta’s cooking standard is. Why is someone like Asuta doing business in a place like the Post Station Town?"<br/>
"Because I’m a denizen of Forest’s Edge. How can a denizen of Forest’s Edge do business inside the city?"<br/>
Dell drooped her brows when she heard that.<br/>
Her mood changed really quickly.<br/>
"Sorry. I said ‘a place like the Post Station Town’. I don’t hate the Post Station Town, you know? The atmosphere in the city is too strict and doesn’t suit my personality, that’s why I come out every day… But, I just bring myself to like the cheap food of the Post Station Town…"<br/>
"Ah, I don’t really mind that."<br/>
"You don’t like others saying your ingredient is cheap, right… Sorry."<br/>
"No, like I said, I’m not mad! Eat up while it’s hot!"<br/>
"… Yes…"<br/>
Dell looked worriedly at me for a while, and then finally recovered her mood and started eating.<br/>
At this moment, a group of cloaked tall men walked over, which almost made me sigh. The timing was bad… or was their timing fixed? As I thought, they were the Silver Vase.<br/>
Dell who was about to walk away from the stall stood stiffly in place when she saw the silver hair under the man’s hood.<br/>
"Asuta, five, give."<br/>
"Thank you for your patronage… Erm, does what we said yesterday still count?"<br/>
I asked Dell anxiously, but she just replied impatiently: "Annoying."<br/>
The girl looked up at Shumimaru angrily.<br/>
"Hey! Let me make this clear first!"<br/>
Shumimaru looked down at Dell silently, like an avatar of calmness and expressionless.<br/>
This difference in temperament was probably the reason for their hostility. Dell raised her brow irately.<br/>
But what came from her mouth was: "Sorry."<br/>
"I don’t like Semu people, but it’s wrong of me to insult a Semu in the western kingdom. I’m sorry."<br/>
An apology with the tone of admonishing others.<br/>
But for this girl, she had to work really hard to make this compromise.<br/>
Shumimaru’s face remained stoic, and he nodded gently.<br/>
"I always wait, Semu, Jaguar, end war. Hate Jaguar, I never."<br/>
"I’m from Zealand, which is in the west of Jaguar so I don’t know anything about the war anyway… Ah, forget it! Don’t let me say so much! I will blurt out something rude again!"<br/>
Dell bit into the "Kiba burger" again, as if she was trying to stuff her mouth. She then stared at me, as if she was asserting that I shouldn’t have any complaints now.<br/>
And of course, I didn’t have any complaints. I thought she was a good girl who could apologize earnestly.<br/>
"… Yesterday, in city, yellow mansion. You, I see."<br/>
Shumimaru said quietly as he waited for his "Kiba burger".<br/>
"Didn’t I tell you not to let me say too much…! Yes, I’m from Zealand so my family is obviously a steel smith."<br/>
"Zealand, steel, famous. From Zealand, buy blades, I, no business."<br/>
"Ah, you are the one who is forcing a sale to that old man? How unfortunate! In terms of knives and pot manufacturing, Jaguar is as good as Semu!"<br/>
She stuck out her chest proudly while saying that and then turned and looked my way a little worriedly.<br/>
"… That, doesn’t count as speaking ill, correct?"<br/>
"Yes, I’m not that sensitive."<br/>
Shumimaru was the one who asked her in the first place.<br/>
They wouldn’t initiate a conversation with Jaguar people lightly, so this had to be important to Shumimaru.<br/>
"We, every year, sell blades. But, he say, no need… Because you, sell."<br/>
"Hmm? Ah. My father signed a special contract with that grandpa. I don’t know the contents and won’t tell my competitors anyway…! So, are you a steel smith too?"<br/>
"No, steel smith. We everything, sell. Blade, jug, glass, cloth."<br/>
"Oh? Then you will need to change your business direction! Steel is a specialty of Jaguar, and Zealand is a city that became prosperous because of steel! We won’t lose to a jack-of-all-trades merchant!"<br/>
Dell looked at my face after finishing each sentence.<br/>
But right now, I felt more relief than anger. And it was necessary for merchants to promote their products.<br/>
"I will work hard, make, good blade… But, say something, can I?"<br/>
"What? You sure can talk for a Semu."<br/>
"Chat, I like. More western language, I want learn… Yellow mansion old man, promise break. Blade, waste prepare. Careful, you should."<br/>
"Hmm? What are you talking about!? If your business fell through because there is no contract, then you can’t complain. How did you manage to run a merchant group?"<br/>
"I sign, contract. Contract, violate. He say, if want sue him, go city, make entry pass. Cannot, so give up, contract."<br/>
When she heard what Shumimaru said, Dell’s face turned from cute to scary. Like a dog who got disturbed mid-meal.<br/>
"What is this? Is that old man such a problematic person? Never mind, instead of a noble, he looks closer to being a broke merchant. So, why are you telling this to a business competitor?"<br/>
"Why… No reason."<br/>
Shumimaru then squinted.<br/>
It was a happy squint.<br/>
"Buy apologize, you did. I think, rarely seen Jaguar girl, you are. So, talk to you, I want."<br/>
Dell averted her head and grumbled: "Hmmp! What’s so strange about that!"<br/>
She then glanced at Shumimaru:<br/>
"… Never mind, I will tell my father to be careful. I don’t know if this is true, so I won’t thank you for this."<br/>
"Thanks, no need. We, make blades, work hard together."<br/>
After finishing this line of questioning, Shumimaru ate his "Kiba burger" too.<br/>
I wanted to tell Shumimaru as soon as possible that he had been permitted to visit the Wu clan, but I should say that after that combative girl had left.<br/>
And so, I decided to make idle chat.<br/>
"Business in the city is hard too… By the way, are you doing business with the nobles, Shumimaru?"<br/>
"Yes. By chance, meet. Old man, many blades, buy. Vegetable knife, meat knife, buy many."<br/>
"Ah, so the knives are for culinary use."<br/>
The knife beside me was a high-quality vegetable knife that I bought from Shumimaru with 18 white copper plates.<br/>
"That old man is really engrossed with gourmet food! He had dealings with several restaurants, and even has a live-in chef! He also prepared rooms for us! His personality isn’t great, but he is a really gracious host!":<br/>
Dell interjected strongly.<br/>
"You lived in that noble’s mansion? What a surprise."<br/>
"It’s not too bad! If things go well, the soldiers in the city will buy their weapons from us… Ah, that’s confidential!"<br/>
I looked at the girl covering her mouth with a wry smile.<br/>
"Don’t worry, I won’t spread that news. We don’t want to get on the noble’s bad side."<br/>
"Please do so, okay? That old man’s personality isn’t that great! To a noble, money is more important than the lives of peasants."<br/>
After Dell said that, her eyes started sparkling.<br/>
"Oh. right! Why don’t I introduce Asuta to that old man? If you work for a noble as a chef, you will be able to rest easy for the rest of your life!"<br/>
"No need, no need! I’m more suited for the Post Station Town! I definitely can’t cook anything that a noble will like!"<br/>
"Is that so… I feel that Asuta won’t lose to the chef in that mansion."<br/>
Dell puffed her cheeks unhappily.<br/>
"It’s better to not be involved with that scummy old man. It will be bad if he drags you in… I really feel like letting them try Asuta’s cooking. Those nobles will definitely be shocked by how delicious kiba is!"<br/>
The nobles in the city were a faraway existence to me. Just working in the Post Station Town was busy enough for me.<br/>
By the way… a scummy old man, huh.<br/>
I hated those types too, but I still wanted to see for myself.<br/>
"By the way, what’s his name? Erm… It’s fine if it’s not convenient for you to tell me."<br/>
"Hmm? His name? What’s he called… Something like Zurun or Taran."<br/>
I felt relief.<br/>
On the other hand, I also didn’t want to get involved with the nobles. And I didn’t want to suspect this girl who had finally warmed up to me as a spy.<br/>
Anyway, I didn’t even know how many aristocrats there were in the Genos city, and it couldn’t be so coincidental… At this moment, Shumimaru said: "No."<br/>
"Yellow mansion, old man, is Count Turan. Turan territory, north of, Genos. Many field, for fuwano, fruits."<br/>
"Yes, that’s right, it’s Count Turan! Erm, that’s the title, not the name, correct?"<br/>
"Yes, Turan Count house, Head, Pyschkurewuss. Genos, three noble house, one of."<br/>
Shumimaru said quietly.<br/>
I looked up, and it was almost noon… I then sighed with all my strength.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
2<br/>
"I, no know well, Lord Pyschkurewuss. Business with him, I do, through his delegate."<br/>
On the way back to Forest’s Edge after closing up shop, Shumimaru who had been recognized as a guest got on the wagon with the girls and explained:<br/>
"Twice, Lord Pyschkurewuss, I see. No much speak. But… I think, let down guard, cannot. Else, promise, he no keep."<br/>
"Is that so. He broke the contract and even asked you to request for an entry pass so you can sue him in the city, how vicious."<br/>
"Yes. So, Lord Pyschkurewuss, I no do business, no regret. Break bad relations, I want."<br/>
Breaking off such ties was for the best.<br/>
But, as the denizens of Forest’s Edge, we couldn’t break off such ties even if we didn’t like their way of doing things. We would finally be having a meeting with the people in the city tomorrow.<br/>
Kamyua Yost and Malfreed seemed to be doing something to dig up the skeletons in Pyschkurewuss’ closet, but they had not found the crucial evidence yet. Our goal was different from them right from the start. It would be possible for us to work together if Pyschkurewuss was confirmed as the common enemy of the denizens of Forest’s Edge and them… But right now, Pyschkurewuss seemed to be just a grey character that took advantage of the Tsun clan.<br/>
Leaving all these matters aside, Pyschkurewuss was a representative of the governing tier in Genos and even demanded the Forest’s Edge settlement to hand over all 39 Tsun clan members.<br/>
Aside from Zuro Tsun who had been judged guilty by the Forest’s Edge, Pyschkurewuss also demanded Diga, Doddo, Mida and Yamiel, Zwei and Aura— and even Tulu Deng, her father and all the branch family members to be handed over to Genos city.<br/>
Anyway, this problem will have to wait until the end of tomorrow’s conference… And someone related to this Pyschkurewuss just happened to be my customer.<br/>
According to Dell who claimed to be the daughter of a steel merchant, she was traveling with her father, who was the leader of a merchant group, and learning the ropes of running a business.<br/>
Her father was a rather wealthy merchant and had been doing business in Genos city for many years now. He even obtained a contract with a grand noble Pyschkurewuss during his last visit.<br/>
This time, he brought the merchandise ordered by Pyschkurewuss— a deal to procure kitchen knives, the same deal that Pyschkurewuss didn’t follow through Shumimaru— and reached Genos two nights ago. Dell, who was allowed to move freely on the second day, came to the Post Station Town with her escort Lavis and discovered my stall.<br/>
There wasn’t anything strange about all this. My stall was situated at the northern end of the Post Station Town and was easy for people coming in from the north side of the city to spot.<br/>
Even though this was just a coincidental meeting, I thought keeping an adequate distance from her would be the appropriate strategy. However, the problem was with Dell and what she thought about all this.<br/>
I carefully steered Gilulu as I sighed.<br/>
"Asuta, down, you seem to be. Worry, I am. Lord Pyschkurewuss, what about him?"<br/>
"Yes, it’s nothing, just that… for the denizens of Forest’s Edge, Pyschkurewuss is a familiar figure."<br/>
"Familiar? Nobles in city, the denizens of Forest’s Edge, dealings?"<br/>
At this point, I decided to answer: "Yes." If I was to say too much, Shumimaru could get embroiled in unnecessary conflict.<br/>
After a moment of silence, Shumimaru muttered: "I see" and then became silent.<br/>
And then, I finally saw the Wu clan village.<br/>
I parked the wagon at the entrance of the plaza and then alighted together with everyone else. We parted ways with Rii Sudora who needed to go shopping, so there was just Shumimaru, Leina Wu, Lala Wu and Shela Wu with me.<br/>
Most of the women and children in the village were working, be it sunning herbs, tanning hides, or chopping wood. They already knew that Shumimaru would be visiting, and there wasn’t any commotion.<br/>
However, the gaze on Shumimaru wasn’t warm at all. It wasn’t hostile or cold, but everyone’s gaze bore the same suspicion— why is an easterner visiting the village. It was the same for the children who cheered when they saw Totos and wagons.<br/>
Curiosity, doubt, and worry filled their gazes as they looked at the foreigner, unsure if he was friend or foe. Before Ai Fa told me to dress appropriately for Forest’s Edge, the other denizens also cast similar gazes towards me.<br/>
Just like the denizens of Forest’s Edge were judged by others in the Post Station Town, the townsfolk got the same treatment in Forest’s Edge. However, things were only so peaceful because this visit was planned ahead of time. If Kamyua Yost and others happened to run into them during their course of work, these men might have even drawn their blades.<br/>
There was still a long road ahead before the denizens of Forest’s Edge and the townsfolk could understand each other… This was a sobering fact.<br/>
"Hmm? Darum-nii?"<br/>
Lala Wu said loudly.<br/>
The person she was talking about walked out from the Wu clan main house right in front of us, approaching us slowly.<br/>
He was wearing hunter’s clothes and a set of large and small blades, showing readiness to hunt.<br/>
After the harvest festival, the Wu clan village entered the hunting offseason. For the next half a month, the hunters could stop their work and rest their exhausted bodies. However, Darum Wu was still in hunter’s garb, and it was the reason for Lala Wu’s befuddlement.<br/>
"What’s going on? Where are you going, armed like that?"<br/>
Darum Wu stopped 3 meters away from us.<br/>
He looked at his family and guests with subdued eyes.<br/>
"… The Zaza village. For the next few days, Wu and Sauti clans will be loaning them people in order to watch Zuro Tsun and his gang."<br/>
"Huh!? So Darum-nii is going? But didn’t you just come back from the Tsun village recently!? Can’t we send someone from branch houses, for example, the Lutim or Lei house?"<br/>
"House Lutim and house Lei will send one man each. I am representing the Wu clan."<br/>
"Why must it be Darum-nii!? Why is Papa Donda dumping all the troublesome matters on you?"<br/>
Lala Wu looked very displeased, Leina Wu seemed worried, while Shela Wu appeared more depressed than anyone else.<br/>
Darum Wu tilted his head puzzledly and then walked closer with the silent footstep of a hunter. After looking at his family members for a while, he said:<br/>
"This has nothing to do with father, I wanted to go on my own. Stop being so noisy."<br/>
"You yourself? But why!? You just came back after half a month, and it hasn’t even been three days! You weren’t home… for my birthday too."<br/>
Lala Wu was more violent towards this second son of the Wu clan than I imagined.<br/>
Darum Wu frowned annoyedly and then patted his sister’s head.<br/>
"The work this time won’t be for too long, assuming the conference tomorrow goes smoothly. Anyway… I have business with the Zaza house."<br/>
"The Zaza house? What business? You don’t have anyone you know in the northern tribe, correct?"<br/>
"What’s with all your questions, so annoying. I’m just going to visit their stupid sons."<br/>
After saying that, Darum Wu stole a glance at Shela Wu but looked away quickly. He then said "I’m going then." and went off.<br/>
That pissed me off, so I yelled: "Wait!"<br/>
"You said you have business with Doddo and Diga, what happened to them? What’s going on here?"<br/>
I was worried about something different from Lala Wu.<br/>
Because of their escape attempt from the Dom house, Doddo and Diga were imprisoned again. There was no meaning for Darum Wu to visit them. I felt uneasy since I didn’t know what Darum Wu was thinking.<br/>
"… This doesn’t concern you, Asuta of the Fa house."<br/>
But Darum Wu didn’t even look at me.<br/>
Feeling worried, I debated on whether to hand the reins to someone and give chase, but a hand grabbed my arm.<br/>
Shela Wu was the one who stopped me.<br/>
She whispered into my ear:<br/>
"Let him go, it must be very important for Darum Wu."<br/>
"Do you know the reason, Shela Wu?"<br/>
I asked softly while staying vigilant of Lala Wu and Leina Wu’s gazes.<br/>
But Shela Wu just shook her head sadly.<br/>
"I don’t know what’s troubling Darum Wu either. But on the night of the banquet, Darum Wu said that he was weak… Not just physically, but also mentally. This weakness might be similar to the men of the Tsun clan who fell into depravity because of the reputation and prowess of their clan— Darum Wu said that."<br/>
Darum Wu wanted to see Diga and Doddo in order to judge how weak he was.<br/>
It was hard for me to understand his feelings.<br/>
Anyway, I couldn’t stop Darum Wu who was heading towards the Zaza house with a mission. We could only go on with stifled feelings in our hearts.<br/>
I parked the wagon before the main house and tied Gilulu who was freed from its load to a tree nearby. We came before the door of the main house and Leina Wu opened the door. Someone unexpected burst out from within.<br/>
"Ohhh, you are finally back! I have been waiting for this!"<br/>
"D-Dan Lutim!? Why are you here today?"<br/>
I didn’t expect Dan Lutim.<br/>
Dan Lutim blocked the path and laughed out loud.<br/>
"Well, there’s a rare guest coming, so I’m here to take a look! We will need to discuss about tomorrow anyway!"<br/>
"Isn’t Kaslan Lutim handling this? Going by tradition, the house head or heir should stay at home, correct?"<br/>
"It’s fine, I will be going home tonight! I don’t need to hunt either, so I’m bored!"<br/>
Following the motto of "Going my way", Dan Lutim brushed off my query and laughed heartily.<br/>
He then scratched his bald head and turned his sights to Shumimaru with a grunt.<br/>
"So you are that guest from the east!? Hmm! It’s been a while since I last saw a Semu, you people are as black as ever! But your hair is as white as an old man’s!"<br/>
This wasn’t in the realm of "Going my way" anymore, it was "No regards for anyone".<br/>
My head started to heat, but Shumimaru didn’t waver at all.<br/>
"Easterner, ‘Silver Vase’ merchants’ bandleader, Shumimaru Jiz Sadumutino. Thank you, letting visit, me today."<br/>
"I’m the head of house Lutim, kin of the Wu clan! You don’t need to be so formal either, guest!"<br/>
Shouldn’t a guest behave properly too?<br/>
But Dan Lutim didn’t care about all that and backed into the house while shouting: "Come in, come in."<br/>
Waiting inside the house were the clan head Donda Wu, his wife Mama Mia Lei, as well as Jiza Wu and Kaslan Lutim.<br/>
"Clan head Donda, I have brought the guest from the eastern kingdom Shumimaru with me."<br/>
Leina Wu announced on behalf of the group.<br/>
She then extended a hand towards Shumimaru.<br/>
"Guest Shumimaru, can you let me safekeep your steel, as I explained during our journey here?"<br/>
"Yes."<br/>
Shumimaru pulled the cloak on his body aside, revealing clothes with swirly patterns similar to the attire in Forest’s Edge. There were all sorts of metallic and gem accessories on his arms and neck and also a crescent-shaped scimitar on his waist. Shumimaru handed the scimitar and his cloak with hidden pockets containing many needles and a pencil-sized dagger to Leina Wu and then bowed to everyone in the hall.<br/>
He was taller than Dan Lutim but had an incredibly slender body.<br/>
However, his long arms and legs were covered in muscles. His posture was proper, so he didn’t give the impression of being weak. This was the Shumimaru, the bandleader of a merchant group, who could withstand the rigors of long journeys across the continent. Shumimaru showed no fear before the powerful hunters from the Wu clan and Lutim house.<br/>
"Please come in, guest from the east. Let us get to know each other first."<br/>
Mama Mia Lei was all smiles as she sat on the top seat in the hall.<br/>
Shumimaru and I took off our shoes and entered the hall. The girls who safekept our steel placed them and the cloak by the clan head and then left the house to forage for firewood.<br/>
"Easterner, ‘Silver Vase’ merchants’ bandleader, Shumimaru Jiz Sadumutino. Thank you, letting visit, me today."<br/>
Shumimaru sat at the bottom seat and repeated what he said earlier.<br/>
"The one putting up airs beside me is the head of the Wu clan, Donda Wu. On the other side is our eldest son Jiza Wu. The one who welcomed you is the head of house Lutim, Dan Lutim, and his eldest son, Kaslan Lutim. I’m the wife of the clan head, Mia Lei Wu… Thank you for visiting us for the sake of our daughter Vena Wu, guest from the east Shumimaru and Asuta."<br/>
Shumimaru and I bowed quietly.<br/>
Mama Mia Lei was all smiles, but Donda Wu still had a scary face. I couldn’t tell what Jiza Wu was thinking either. Dan Lutim was smiling cheerfully like Ebisu, and the calm Kaslan Lutim made me feel at ease.[1]<br/>
"And so, I want to understand first. Dear guest Shumimaru, why are you so worried about Vena’s health? Leina might have asked you the same though. Vena isn’t hurt too bad and can go to town the day after tomorrow."<br/>
"But, day after tomorrow, I gone. I, morning three days later, Genos, go from. Back next, half year… No meet day after tomorrow, no meet half year."<br/>
"And how would that be an inconvenience to you? I heard that you two don’t really know each other well."<br/>
"Inconvenience, no… Just meet, I want."<br/>
Shumimaru sat with his legs crossed and looked straight at Mama Mia Lei.<br/>
Dan Lutim who seemed happier than Mama Mia Lei laughed loudly.<br/>
"I never thought that someone in town will be interested in a woman of Forest’s Edge! Anyway, you want to take Vena Wu as your wife, right, guest from the east?"<br/>
He was so direct that even a bystander like me broke out in cold sweat.<br/>
Shumimaru seemed to have made up his mind and squinted a little.<br/>
"Marry… hard. Vena Wu, me, different faith. I, Semu, Vena Wu, Selva."<br/>
"Fufu, so you are saying you will marry her if you worship the same god?"<br/>
"Assumption, meaningless. Vena Wu, incredible woman. Semu, no have, like Vena Wu, charming girl. Definitely, because, denizen of Forest’s Edge, she is."<br/>
"Right. But not many women in the Forest’s Edge have a figure like hers! So it’s only natural that she enamored you with her looks!"<br/>
Shumimaru tilted his head slightly and asked: "Looks? Looks, charm, unrelated. Vena Wu charming, because of heart."<br/>
"Oh…? I didn’t speak with that girl much, so I’m not sure about her heart! But she is beautiful, right?"<br/>
"Beautiful… Vena Wu, appearance, beautiful?"<br/>
I was shocked.<br/>
However, Shumimaru had serious eyes.<br/>
"Semu thinks, slim, beautiful. Vena Wu, no slim. Semu, no think, Vena Wu, beautiful."<br/>
"What!? She isn’t exactly slim, but that’s the perfect sense of meatiness for a woman! Dear guest, there is no woman in this world as tempting as she!"<br/>
"Please stop for a while, Dan Lutim. It’s awkward for me and the clan head to listen to you saying this as your old friend."<br/>
"Don’t worry! I have given all my love to my late wife! I won’t remarry again!"<br/>
Dan Lutim said with a hearty laugh, while Mama Mia Lei sighed and replied: "That’s not the problem."<br/>
At this moment, Jiza Wu spoke:<br/>
"Guest from the east, why are you so obsessed with my sister? Your relationship with her is superficial, and you don’t think she is charming enough to be your wife. So I don’t think you have any reason to be so obsessed with her."<br/>
"I think, charming, she is. Vena Wu, amazing. Appearance, no pretty, but Vena Wu, cute."<br/>
Shumimaru said calmly without showing his emotions.<br/>
"No, appearance, charming too. Vena Wu, beautiful eyes. Mesmerizing smile. Enchanting voice… Marry her, difficult. But Vena Wu, charming."<br/>
"Even if you find her charming, there is no point in the relationship between man and woman if it doesn’t involve marriage. I don’t know what are the customs in town, but this is the reality in Forest’s Edge."<br/>
"Yes! Jiza Wu, we actually thought of the same thing! I think so too! Friendship does bond men and women sometimes, but what are you seeking from Vena Wu, guest?"<br/>
Dan Lutim stroked his beard as he leaned forth.<br/>
"You neither plan to wed Vena Wu nor marry into Forest’s Edge; what’s the point of deepening this relationship? Do you want to be Vena Wu’s friend? Or have a one-night stand?"<br/>
Shumimaru was stumped for the first time.<br/>
He then replied: "Don’t know. But, see her, I want. Painful, I feel, if no see her. That’s all… Sorry, shallow thinking."<br/>
"That’s so shallow! But your feelings are deep!"<br/>
Dan Lutim laughed cheerfully after saying that.<br/>
"Driven by vague emotions, someone from town visited Forest’s Edge. What a surprise! Donda Wu, just how charming is your daughter!"<br/>
"Enough with your blabbering. You are a guest too, so behave yourself."<br/>
Donda Wu spoke for the first time.<br/>
He stared holes into Shumimaru with his fiery blue eyes.<br/>
"Easterner, for the past eight decades, no denizen of Forest’s Edge had tied the knot with someone outside our tribe. That is the case for westerners, much lest easterners."<br/>
"Yes."<br/>
"And the Forest’s Edge won’t permit ridiculous things like a one-night stand. Man and woman can only be bonded by marriage."<br/>
"Yes."<br/>
"If you understand, do with her what you will."<br/>
After Donda Wu finished speaking, he stood his huge body up.<br/>
"As the head of the Wu clan, I’m grateful that you made the trip here out of concern for my daughter’s health… Hearth tender of the Fa house, are you here for Vena too?"<br/>
"Y-Yes."<br/>
"Hmm… Hey, take them inside. I will continue sleeping until those guys from the Sauti and Zaza clans come."<br/>
That last bit was directed towards Mama Mia Lei.<br/>
Mama Mia Lei looked up at her husband’s annoyed face and smile: "I understand, clan head."<br/>
"What, you are sleeping? You sure like to sleep! Who is going to tend to us when you are asleep, Donda Wu?"<br/>
With the parting line "Annoying," Donda Wu disappeared down the corridor to the right.<br/>
Mama Mia Lei stood up as she watched him leave.<br/>
"Dear guest Shumimaru, I will bring you to my daughter’s room. Jiza, please entertain our guests for a while."<br/>
And so, we headed down the left corridor, opposite where Donda Wu went.<br/>
Grandma Jiba’s chamber was in the right too, so this was the first time I headed down this way. Just like what I remembered, the corridor extended 10 meters or so, with three doors along the wall. Mama Mia Lei knocked the door closest to us.<br/>
"Vena, the clan head gave his permission, so I brought our guest Shumimaru over. Asuta is here too, can they go in?"<br/>
After about 10 seconds of silence, Mama Mia Lei was about to knock again when the door was slid to the side violently.<br/>
"Yo, Asuta! It’s great that Dad didn’t punch our guest!"<br/>
It wasn’t Vena Wu, but Ludo Wu.<br/>
And he was holding Jiza Wu’s son Kota Wu in his arms for some reason. The infant’s pure and black eyes were looking at Shumimaru and me curiously.<br/>
"Hey, can someone watch over Kota for now?"<br/>
"Yes. Kota, come play with grandma."<br/>
Mama Mia Lei smiled brilliantly and rubbed the cheeks of the toddler. Kota laughed happily in response.<br/>
"Yeah, I remember your hair that is as white as Grandma Jiba’s. Dear guest, I’m the youngest son of the Wu clan, Ludo Wu. Nice to meet you."<br/>
"I, Shumimaru Jiz Sadumutino. Seen you, I have."<br/>
"Well, I worked as an escort in the Post Station Town for a long time… Let me say this first, my father permitted you to see Vena-nee because he trusts you. If you betray his trust, I will definitely kill you."<br/>
Ludo Wu tapped his waist.<br/>
Hanging there was the new dagger that he bought after that incident with Tay Tsun.<br/>
"You might be good, but you are no match for me. I heard that Semu use poison, so if you make any strange moves, I will kill you on the spot… Anyway, can you promise to stay more than an arm’s length away from Vena-nee?"<br/>
"Promise, I will."<br/>
"Yes, please do. I don’t want to dirty my own house with blood… And that goes for you too; Asuta, don’t do anything weird."<br/>
I won’t do anything like that… I thought and just considered this a mandatory process.<br/>
If my judgment of character was off, and Shumimaru was actually scheming to harm the Wu clan, then Vena Wu would be in danger because of me. Donda Wu’s arrangement actually placed a lot of trust in Shumimaru.<br/>
"Come in then. This is Vena-nee’s room, so it is really girly, hence, be prepared, alright?"<br/>
Ludo Wu backed away, and we finally entered the room.<br/>
There wasn’t anything very feminine about this place, but it was filled with flowery fragrance.<br/>
Just like Grandma Jiba’s chamber, the room was tatami big. There was only one big cabinet taking an entire wall, with daily necessities placed on it. However, this room still had the air and style of a women’s quarters, which made it hard for us to calm down.<br/>
On the other walls were brightly-colored clothes, decorated with flowers and a deep fragrance.<br/>
Women’s accessories were adorned on top of them. These were probably used for their banquet dress. From afar, they seemed to be sparkling metal or stones. The shimmering rainbow light must be from their veils and sashes.<br/>
Not only was there a cloth hanging on the wall as decoration, there was also flimsy cloth with swirly patterns there— probably the girl’s laundry.<br/>
This had to be the room she shared with her other sisters. There were plenty of clothes here, with most of them looking like lingerie or swimsuit. But this was the attire normally worn in Forest’s Edge, so there was nothing to be shy about… Yet, I still felt as if I had stumbled into a forbidden garden.<br/>
And the owner of this forbidden garden was lying elegantly in the room.<br/>
There were several cushions on the bed, and the thicc body lying on it belonged to Vena Wu.<br/>
She supported her head with her right hand, with her body facing us like a sleeping Buddha. There was nothing special about her posture, but it accentuated the curves on her body.<br/>
Her eyes were narrowed into a slit as usual, and there wasn’t any expression on her face. Her injured right ankle was wrapped in light grey bandages. There was some sort of herb medicine under it, and I could smell a faint refreshing and stimulating fragrance that was a bit unlike flowers.<br/>
"Sorry for my untidy appearance… My butt will hurt if I keep sitting down…"<br/>
"It’s fine, don’t worry. It’s really unfortunate, Vena Wu."<br/>
I sat down in the middle of the room.<br/>
Shumimaru sat beside me, while Ludo Wu sat down very close to Vena Wu, opposite us.<br/>
"Vena Wu, visit, sudden, sorry."<br/>
Shumimaru quietly lowered his head.<br/>
Vena Wu didn’t reply.<br/>
Maybe I was just imagining it, but her eyes looked a little annoyed. This atmosphere definitely wasn’t welcoming Shumimaru.<br/>
After that, silence engulfed the place. Be it Shumimaru or Vena Wu, they just stared at each other without a word.<br/>
Time crawled slowly like a snail, and Ludo Wu who couldn’t stand the silence finally said:<br/>
"Erm, didn’t you have business with Vena-nee? The Zaza and Sauti clans will be coming in a while, so I can’t stay with you for too long."<br/>
"Time, no have?"<br/>
"There is still some time left."<br/>
"Thank you, precious time, give me."<br/>
But the silence continued.<br/>
"Erm… If you are not going to do anything, can you please leave…?"<br/>
Vena Wu said coldly.<br/>
Shumimaru tilted his head puzzledly.<br/>
"Thing, I am doing."<br/>
"What thing… You mean… looking at each other without saying a word…?"<br/>
"Yes. I, morning, three days later, Genos, leave. Vena Wu, carved in heart, mind, I want."<br/>
If he said it more fluently, this would be a great line.<br/>
But I thought this was the best that the introverted and honest Shumimaru could do to convey his true feelings.<br/>
However, Vena Wu looked annoyed.<br/>
"Fufu. When Vena-nee is able to walk by herself, she can go to town. That might occur the day after tomorrow. Wouldn’t this make a wasted trip for you?"<br/>
Ludo Wu said on behalf of his silent sister, while Shumimaru narrowed his eyes in a satisfied manner.<br/>
"Good, if we meet, day after tomorrow. Your injury, heal well, I hope."<br/>
"I don’t understand… If it is a proposal, I can just turn it down. What should I do in a situation like this…?"<br/>
Vena Wu used her free left hand to fidget with her brown hair.<br/>
"You are not here to propose marriage… or a one-nightstand… or to be friends… Then why are you here…?"<br/>
Huh? I almost fell down from surprise.<br/>
However, Shumimaru’s expression remained the same.<br/>
Shumimaru stared at Vena Wu and then took off an accessory he was wearing on his right wrist.<br/>
"Vena Wu, gift, accept can you?"<br/>
"…"<br/>
"Stone, misfortune, keep away. Hope, Vena Wu, ever healthy."<br/>
It was a silver locket, with several fingernail-sized pink-colored stones embedded in it.<br/>
The workmanship looked a little similar to the blue stone necklace that I gave Ai Fa.<br/>
Ludo Wu glanced at the silent Vena Wu and then said:<br/>
"… What will you do, Vena-nee? If you want it, I can safekeep it for you."<br/>
Vena Wu propped herself up, exerting the same aura as Donda Wu did earlier. While seated sideways, she said quietly:<br/>
"But why…? I can’t accept a gift from someone I’m not close with…"<br/>
"Vena Wu, ever healthy, I wish you. Sad I will, if hurt, Vena Wu is, after leave."<br/>
"…"<br/>
"Return gift, no need. Vena Wu, happiness, I hope."<br/>
"Since he is giving it to you, just take it. If you don’t want it, just throw it away."<br/>
Ludo Wu yawned, as if he was bored by this interaction.<br/>
Vena Wu whose head was slightly lowered glared at Shumimaru through her long fringe.<br/>
"… Are you mocking me…?"<br/>
Shumimaru blinked blankly.<br/>
"Mock? Understand, I do not."<br/>
"Why are you wishing for my happiness…? I thought you’re not interested in fat women…?"<br/>
As I thought!<br/>
Ludo Wu scratched his blonde hair and mumbled: "The cat’s out of the bag, huh."<br/>
These two siblings definitely eavesdropped on the conversation in the hall.<br/>
"Since I’m so fat… no one wants to marry me. I will just end up as a middle-aged woman who’s only good for her strength…"<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
"That’s not true; didn’t you turn down all those men who proposed to you, Vena-nee?"<br/>
"Yes… So leave me alone…"<br/>
Vena Wu leaned weakly onto the wall behind her.<br/>
When he saw her do that, Ludo Wu grunted and stroked his smooth chin.<br/>
"It’s almost time, dear guests. I’m sorry, but that’s all for today."<br/>
Shumimaru replied "Yes," and then lowered his gaze with the accessory clutched tightly in his hand.<br/>
He stood up, bowed quietly at Vena Wu, and turned around.<br/>
"Sorry about that. She had a fever yesterday, and even discounting that, she had been grounded at home for two days. That’s why Vena-nee isn’t in a good mood. However… she had always been frail."<br/>
After leaving the room and closing the door, Ludo Wu started talking.<br/>
"She is especially bad at affairs of the heart. Because of her looks, Vena-nee had been wooed by tens of men before. That’s why… she would get incredibly depressed after turning down someone. In the end, she became a woman that no man dares to approach."<br/>
Ludo Wu smiled and showed his white teeth as he spoke about Vena Wu’s sad past.<br/>
"But this is the first time Vena-nee met a man who doesn’t think she is pretty; that’s why she is so upset. She almost exploded with rage when she heard that while eavesdropping. So this is her limit for today."<br/>
"… Yes."<br/>
"Well, do you want me to pass this to Vena-nee?"<br/>
Ludo Wu looked at Shumimaru’s clenched right fist.<br/>
But Shumimaru shook his head and answered: "No need."<br/>
"Day after tomorrow, Vena Wu, I give. If no meet, give up."<br/>
"I see. Shumimaru, you sure are an interesting man."<br/>
Ludo Wu said as he lightly tapped Shumimaru’s chest with his fist.<br/>
"It will be fun if you marry into the Forest’s Edge. But that isn’t a simple matter either. But… If you truly wish for Vena-nee to be happy, I can’t bring myself to hate you. Farewell then."<br/>
<br/>
<br/>

"Huh? Mia Lei Wu, is it just you alone?"<br/>
When I returned to the hall, only Mama Mia Lei was there.<br/>
"Yes, a large group of guests arrived. The house is too small, so I asked them to wait outside."<br/>
A large group of guests?<br/>
But this was the Wu clan main house, which was big enough to house twelve people and a toddler. Even if Graff Zaza, Dali Sauti, and their followers came, they should be able to fit inside the hall.<br/>
"Aside from the two tribe chiefs, there were also some men that I don’t really recognize. They seemed very agitated too; I hope there won’t be any commotions… Oh right, Ai Fa is with them too."<br/>
"Huh? Ai Fa?"<br/>
I felt even more lost.<br/>
Anyway, we retrieved the cloak and steel that Shumimaru deposited and went outside.<br/>
What awaited for us were fearsome Forest’s Edge men— more than ten of them. The main house was indeed too small for these many people.<br/>
Donda Wu, who was holed up in his room until this time, cast a sideway glance at us: "Done with your business?"<br/>
Standing beside him were Jiza Wu, Dan Lutim, Kaslan Lutim… as well as Dali Sauti and Graff Zaza who reached when I wasn’t aware. These tribal chiefs also brought followers along, so there were eight of them.<br/>
Ai Fa and six men stood on the other side, as if they were opposing them.<br/>
When Ai Fa saw me, she nodded as if she was saying "Thank you for your hard work". I felt relieved from the sight of her calm face.<br/>
"Is that the easterner guest visiting the Wu clan?"<br/>
One of the three tribal chiefs, Graff Zaza of the Zaza house said it with his thick and hoarse voice.<br/>
No matter how many people there were, the men from the Zaza house were prominent with the kiba heads they wore on their heads. And this guy was as buff as Donda Wu too.<br/>
"The Wu clan is free to invite whomever they want. But we are busy now, so please leave."<br/>
"Alright, I go. Clan head, Donda Wu, today, thank you."<br/>
Shumimaru deftly evaded Graff Zaza’s gaze and bowed towards Donda Wu.<br/>
I grabbed Shumimaru who was about to leave by the arm.<br/>
"Wait, Shumimaru. Erm… Can we talk for a while?"<br/>
I didn’t know why I said that. But I didn’t want Shumimaru to leave just like that.<br/>
"Asuta, talk, no mind. Happy, I am."<br/>
"Erm, what should we talk about…"<br/>
I couldn’t just leave Ai Fa alone in this situation either.<br/>
As I was looking around me, Shumimaru pointed with his thin fingers at the wagon parked beside the Wu house.<br/>
"I wait. Where can’t hear, but can see you."<br/>
"Ah, thank you very much."<br/>
As expected of a caravan band leader that traveled the world, Shumimaru walked undauntedly towards the wagon under the doubtful gazes of the Forest’s Edge men.<br/>
When he was far away enough, Graff Zaza faced the men I wasn’t familiar with again.<br/>
"… I got the gist of what you want to say. It’s regarding the number of people and the representatives we will be sending tomorrow, right?"<br/>
"Yes. Can you understand, tribal chiefs?"<br/>
The one who answered Graff Zaza was a small-sized man with a monkey-like face, the house head of the Sudora house.<br/>
On a closer look, I saw a few familiar faces. On the other side of Ai Fa was the head of the Fou house, and beside him should be the head of the Lan house. Were all of them from minor houses?<br/>
"We will submit to the decision of the tribal chiefs and won’t take the capability and judgment of the tribal chiefs lightly. However, we won’t just follow blindly like our time under the Tsun clan. We want to see what the tribal chiefs see, hear what they hear, and work hand in hand with them."<br/>
The head of the Fou house continued where the Sudora head left off.<br/>
He seemed about Donda Wu’s age and was tall and skinny.<br/>
"Hmm, so not just the conference tomorrow, you also want the rights to discuss these issues with the three tribal chiefs?"<br/>
One of the three tribal chiefs, Dali Sauti said in a dignified manner that was beyond his age. His build was on par with the other tribal chiefs too.<br/>
On a second observation, I noticed that there was a prominent difference between the chiefs and the others.<br/>
First, the number of tusks and horns hanging on their necks was vastly different. Next was their attire. The clothes on the minor houses were a little worn out.<br/>
The biggest difference was their body shape and aura.<br/>
Including kins like the Lutim, the tribal chiefs were all buffed and full of might. In comparison, the minor houses might have the ferocity and intimidation befitting a hunter of the Forest’s Edge, there was an air of poverty about them.<br/>
The minor houses basically lived from hand to mouth, and it showed in their body and aura.<br/>
However, the smallest sized Sudora house head answered Dali Sauti without fear: "That’s right."<br/>
"And we will convey the content of the discussions to the other house heads too. If we can spread the word to the north and south ends of Forest’s Edge, we won’t need to wait for the annual house head conference to learn the intent of the tribal chiefs."<br/>
"Are you afraid of us falling into depravity like the Tsun clan?"<br/>
Graff Zaza said in a heavy tone. He wasn’t trying to intimidate others, but there was an indescribable tension in the air whenever he spoke.<br/>
But even so, the head of the Sudora house didn’t back down. He shook his head and answered with a shake of his head: "No."<br/>
"The Wu clan, Sauti clan, and Zaza house will keep watch over each other, and it’s impossible for the three chiefs to become depraved at the same time. However, when we headed to the Post Station Town to protect Asuta of the Fa house together with the men from the Wu clan during that incident a few days ago, I happened to hear something."<br/>
"And then we, the Fou and Lan houses, learned what the Sudora house head discovered. We heard that… Graff Zaza thinks we should cut off ties with the city and desert the Morga Forest’s Edge. Is that true?"<br/>
When he heard what the heads of the Sudora and Fou said, Graff Zaza narrowed his eyes.<br/>
"I didn’t say we must desert this place. But I think we should give up on life in this place if we have to throw away our honor of living as humans."<br/>
The minor house heads started getting rowdy.<br/>
The head of the Fou house glared at Graff Zaza with serious eyes.<br/>
"This is a shocking revelation. To give up this land we have lived on for eighty years… Are the nobles of Genos so heartless?"<br/>
"I only spoke with an old man named Pyschkurewuss. The denizens of Forest’s Edge offered our blades to the Lord of Genos, not that old man… If that man holds our blades, I will not hesitate in taking them back."<br/>
A carnivorous light burned in Graff Zaza’s eyes.<br/>
"I also think that if we don’t meet with the Lord of Genos and continue being shunned by others, we would fall into depravity like the Zattsu Tsun and Zuro Tsun too. Then giving up on the honor of being ‘kiba hunters’ and seeking a new land will be the right path to take."<br/>
"To be so rash after just one meeting… I don’t think we need to say this, but Graff Zaza, you are also regretting your frivolous words too, correct? So we don’t need to worry about us deserting this place so hastily."<br/>
Graff Zaza clicked his tongue after hearing Dali Sauti’s words.<br/>
"Also, Graff Zaza’s view isn’t completely baseless. If our goal doesn’t coincide with Genos, we won’t be able to work together with them. If the Lord of Genos refuses any compromise and continues supporting Pyschkurewuss, there will be no choice but to abandon the Morga Forest. However… We can’t come to a hasty conclusion without understanding the true intents of the landlord."<br/>
"What kind of person is this Pyschkurewuss…? After hearing what you said, there is all the more reason for us to work closely together with the tribal chiefs. Not many people will be willing to abandon the Morga Forest without knowing what is going on."<br/>
The Sudora head said quietly in a gloomy voice.<br/>
"And that isn’t all. We need to be on the same page with the tribal chiefs regarding the Fa house’s stall."<br/>
I was surprised when my house was mentioned.<br/>
Ai Fa remained silent, while the head of the Fou house beside her took a step forward in uncharacteristic enthusiasm.<br/>
"Don’t the three tribal chiefs hold different opinions towards the Fa house’s business? The Wu clan’s members are employed by the Fa house, the Sauti clan is neutral, while the Zaza house is against it. Despite what the Zaza house thinks, the Fa house’s business won’t be forbidden, correct?"<br/>
"You got a problem with that?"<br/>
"No, I’m just thinking that the tribal chiefs need to know if their opinion holds water."<br/>
The Lan house continued after the Fou head:<br/>
"I also think the tribal chiefs need to know our thoughts about this."<br/>
The head of the Sudora said:<br/>
"Present here are six houses: Sudora, Fou, Lan, Latzu, Gazu, and Beim. Our homes are quite close to the Fa house, and, aside from the Beim, we all concur with the Fa house’s actions. We have also learned bloodletting and cooking delicious food from them. However, after the house head conference, the houses that live further away are living the same impoverished life as before."<br/>
"There’s something wrong with that?"<br/>
In response to Dali Sauti’s calm words, the Sudora head replied: "Yes."<br/>
"During the house head conference, we agreed to observe the Fa house quietly and judge if their actions are poison or medicine to the Forest’s Edge. But in just twenty or so days after the house head conference, our lives have changed drastically."<br/>
"You are saying that the kiba sold by the Fa house has brought us a prosperous life?"<br/>
"It’s nowhere near prosperous yet, but the fact remains that we have obtained a staggering amount of copper plates. To be honest, I am doubting if it was right for us to get so much copper plates just by making that amount of jerky. And the head of the Beim is adamant that the denizens of Forest’s Edge shouldn’t earn this wealth."<br/>
This was the first time I heard of the Beim house.<br/>
Aside from the kins of the Zaza house, they opposed the actions of the Fa house the most strongly of all the minor houses.<br/>
"The Fa house claims that they are doing business in order to bring prosperity to Forest’s Edge. This means that it will involve the whole Forest’s Edge. So parties from both the for and against camps should witness what the Fa house is doing and determine for themselves whether this will become medicine or poison for Forest’s Edge."<br/>
It was slowly devolving into a monologue by the Sudora house.<br/>
The head of the Sudora house continued speaking to the tribal chiefs who were one size bigger than him:<br/>
"As a fellow denizen of the Forest’s Edge, I think the Wu clan, Zaza house, and Sauti clan are too wealthy. Wealthy people won’t understand the thinking of poor families, and impoverished folks won’t understand the worries of rich denizens. I think the head of the Fa house is unbiased because she experienced poverty in her youth and became wealthy by her own abilities."<br/>
Ai Fa appeared annoyed when she heard that. My mistress didn’t take compliments from others well and was introverted.<br/>
"The thinking of the impoverished folks, huh. But no matter how wealthy a clan is, we won’t look down on impoverished houses."<br/>
The Sudora house head looked with serious eyes at Dali Sauti who was tilting his head.<br/>
"Then let me ask you, Sauti clan head. Have you ever lost a child to starvation before? Have you ever had thoughts: ’If I let my wife eat the fruits hanging before her, she will be able to nurse my child’? Have you ever lamented your own failures as you watched your child wither away day by day?"<br/>
"… N-No."<br/>
"Then can you understand our hatred for the Tsun clan? In addition to not hunting and splurging the bonus money in leisure, they even laid their hands on the grace of the forest. Can you, wealthy clans, understand how we felt when we decided to forgive them?"<br/>
Dali Sauti was silent.<br/>
The head of the Sudora house took a deep breath and said quietly:<br/>
"However, letting the tribal chief fall into depravity is the sin of all denizens of Forest’s Edge for being weak. I think what Donda Wu said is very just. During previous house head conferences, when the Wu clan was trying to bring the Tsun clan to task, I didn’t do anything to help… So I agree with Donda Wu. After hearing his thoughts, I have slowly come around to forgiving the Tsun clan. If I didn’t listen to his explanation and was simply told to forgive the Tsun clan, I probably wouldn’t have yielded to the demands of the three tribal chiefs."<br/>
"…"<br/>
"I believe the tribal chiefs will lead us towards the right path. However, I hope we can also see what the tribal chiefs see, hear what they hear, and walk down the same path… The demise of the Tsun clan, the rise of the new tribal chiefs, and the Fa house’s business in the Post Station Town. With so many changes happening in such a short time, can our lives continue as before?"<br/>
After the Sudora head finished, silence engulfed the entire place.<br/>
The one who broke this silence was Donda Wu who had been listening quietly.<br/>
"… Simply put, your request right now is for a representative to participate in all tribal chiefs conferences that concern the future of Forest’s Edge, correct?"<br/>
"Yes, that’s right. Just like the tribal chiefs disseminating the information to their kin houses, we will also spread this information to the other minor houses."<br/>
"You want all seven people here to join in?"<br/>
"Of course not, just two will be enough. If possible, I hope that the heads of the Fou and Beim houses can participate."<br/>
"Hmm… I have no reason to reject."<br/>
Donda Wu looked at the two tribal chiefs beside him.<br/>
"I’m only worried about one thing. Worrying about unnecessary things might affect your work as hunters."<br/>
"That also applies to the bloodletting and cooking too. As we discussed at the house head conference, we can’t let our goal of leading a prosperous life dally our work."<br/>
Dali Sauti answered quietly while Graff Zaza grunted without a word.<br/>
The proposal by the minor houses appeared to be accepted by the tribal chiefs.<br/>
"That house head suddenly came to the Fa house, saying that they wanted to discuss something with the tribal chiefs and asked me to come along."<br/>
Ai Fa explained in the wagon.<br/>
"The heads of the Sudora and Fou houses seemed to have discussed the things mentioned just now a long time ago. When I heard they want to have a meeting in the Wu clan village, I became even more certain about that."<br/>
"I see. This is the first time I heard of the Beim house; are they very against the Fa house’s business?"<br/>
I asked as I held onto Gilulu’s reins.<br/>
I could feel Ai Fa who was sitting right behind the driver’s seat shaking her head.<br/>
"Don’t worry. The Sudora house head said the Beim house only opposed so strongly because they felt uneasy about the recent drastic changes."<br/>
"Is the head of the Sudora house really fine? It’s a bit late to say this, but the first payment we gave for his jerky was quite a tidy sum."<br/>
"It’s fine. They understood that they earned that much copper plates that round because only seven houses took part in the jerky production. That’s why… He said we should let more houses chip in, and share the wealth."<br/>
Dividing the wealth as evenly as possible… Mama Mia Lei and I both shared this opinion, and we had already conveyed this to the head of the Sudora house. His idea was also built on this opinion too.<br/>
"Anyway, I want to teach the other houses bloodletting, so the wealth can be distributed to everyone. Then both the support camp and opposition camp can judge whether this is medicine or poison for Forest’s Edge… We should also convey to the three tribal chiefs how we came up with this idea."<br/>
"Yes."<br/>
"I’m also curious about how the three tribal chiefs think too. We should also learn what their opinions are. That’s why we gathered in the Wu clan village."<br/>
"Yes, I understand. This opinion really suits the style of Forest’s Edge too. I actually feel the same way too. In a sense, this is a brand-new way of thinking that has never occurred to the denizens of Forest’s Edge before."<br/>
"The head of the Sudora house being a weirdo is probably a factor. The Fou and Lan house must have been convinced by him too."<br/>
The head of the Sudora house, huh.<br/>
He had a small stature rarely found amongst the men of Forest’s Edge and a monkey-like face and belonged to an impoverished family with few members. His kin house had also died out… But even so, the gaze of this middle-aged man still was sharp.<br/>
His wife was helping me at the stall, and he also saved me from the hands of Tay Tsun. It remained uncertain whether Tay Tsun was really trying to kill me, but he was still my benefactor.<br/>
"But among the representatives of the minor houses isn’t Sudora, but the Fou and Beim house heads. I was so agitated, wondering if Ai Fa would get picked."<br/>
"Fa house has few members and is busy with chores, so the head of the Sudora house said that he won’t burden me with such a heavy responsibility. He also couldn’t be away from his house for the same reason. He felt that there should be one house from the supporting and opposition camp, so the Fou house and Beim house were nominated."<br/>
"Yes, that’s very true. The Sudora house head sure is quick-witted."<br/>
The Fou and Beim house heads would be participating in tomorrow’s conference too. They were now holding the last meeting in the Wu clan before the actual event tomorrow, while the rest of the house heads headed south to relay this news to the other houses.<br/>
The Forest’s Edge tribe, that didn’t concern themselves with houses that were not related to them by blood, was now actively engaging with each other. This was an attempt to build a social network within this Forest’s Edge and its 500 odd-denizens.<br/>
They held opposing views, but the fact that the Tsun clan fell into depravity in the last decade due to a lack of interaction with the other houses spurred them to change their mindset.<br/>
"So you understand? Then it’s about time you answer my question."<br/>
Ai Fa leaned forth into the driver’s seat.<br/>
"… Why did you invite that easterner to the Fa house?"<br/>
Ai Fa wasn’t the only one on the wagon, Shumimaru was there too.<br/>
Ai Fa didn’t suppress her volume, and Shumimaru, who was sitting in the wagon, was admiring the scenery outside right now.<br/>
"Well, many things happened. I want to cheer Shumimaru up, so I invited him over for dinner."<br/>
Shumimaru was unexpectedly happy when I invited him.<br/>
He must have been depressed by how his meeting with Vena Wu went. If Vena Wu’s injury didn’t heal by the day after tomorrow, he would have to part ways with her for a long time without seeing her again.<br/>
"… You are not asking him to stay the night, right?"<br/>
"No, Shumimaru said he can’t just leave his merchant comrades be and spend the night elsewhere, so don’t worry. Ah… Can you send him back to the Post Station Town with Gilulu later? I can’t ride Gilulu at night yet."<br/>
"Well, that’s better than letting someone I don’t know spend the night at our place. With this wagon, I don’t need to be physically close to someone who isn’t a family member too."<br/>
Ai Fa seemed gleeful; she was probably happy that she could drive the wagon.<br/>
After twenty minutes of journey, the Fa house appeared before us.<br/>
Even though Gilulu shortened the journey greatly, we still stayed too long at the Wu clan and came back later than usual. Having another person dine with us wasn’t much of a problem though.<br/>
"We are here. Shumimaru, welcome to the Fa house."<br/>
I was too embarrassed to call this ‘my humble abode’.<br/>
After alighting, Shumimaru looked at the Fa house which was two sizes smaller than the Wu clan.<br/>
"Everyone, as expected, southern style."<br/>
"Huh? What do you mean?"<br/>
"House. Style, southern."<br/>
Southern probably refers to the southern kingdom Jaguar.<br/>
But which part of it was like a southern style? The houses in the Genos Post Station Town would more or less use materials aside from lumber, but the structure was basically the same as the Forest’s Edge.<br/>
At this moment, I remembered. Most of the buildings in the Post Station Town were erected by the Jaguar people, and Pops and his architects also visited Genos to maintain the buildings.<br/>
Just like how most buildings in Japan are western style too. How intriguing.<br/>
I pondered as I carried the ingredients and pot into the kitchen. Ai Fa tied Gilulu to the tree and said: "Of course."<br/>
"When our ancestors moved to this forest eight decades ago, they tried for a time to build houses with straws as we did in the dark jungles of the south. But there is a lot of rain here and the grass huts decomposed quickly. So they learned from the southerners staying in Genos how to build sturdier houses."<br/>
"I see. Interested, I am."<br/>
It was interesting indeed.<br/>
The round ceremonial hall building we saw in the Tsun clan last time was probably the traditional building of the denizens of Forest’s Edge. Let’s ask Grandma Jiba about this some other time.<br/>
"And, Forest’s Edge, clothes, eastern. Weaving pattern, from east, spread to Genos."<br/>
"Huh? This pattern was chosen to make it hard for the kiba to spot us in the forest."<br/>
"Yes. But, Morga Forest, big and rich. Source of fiber, wood, many. Denizens of Forest’s Edge, weave strings, cannot?"<br/>
"We used to weave our own clothes when we first moved here. But when we learned that the tree barks and fruits were the kiba’s food, we were forbidden from stripping the trees. Easterner… you really like to ask questions."<br/>
"Sorry. Interested in Forest’s Edge, I am. Questions, unhappy, made you?"<br/>
"… Not really. I just thought that, contrary to your appearance, you sure can talk."<br/>
"Southerner, daughter of merchant, same thing she said."<br/>
"Daughter of the merchant?"<br/>
I grew stiff for a moment, but relaxed when I remembered that Shumimaru shouldn’t have seen me being hit by Dell.<br/>
Even then, I should tell Ai Fa about her. Leaving other matters aside, we needed to be wary of people who were close to Pyschkurewuss.<br/>
Anyway, even Ai Fa who was not good at dealing with others had no trouble talking with Shumimaru. It was a pleasant surprise for me.<br/>
90 minutes later, we dined in the Fa house which was a little dim.<br/>
"Sorry for the wait, I hope the taste is to your liking."<br/>
I cooked dinner while preparing the ingredients to be sold tomorrow and finally finished dinner at the usual time. Roughly 30% of the food prep work wasn’t finished, so I would have to work on them after Shumimaru goes back. I didn’t need to sacrifice any sleep to finish the work, so it wasn’t a big deal.<br/>
"Fragrant, very nice."<br/>
The meat dish was cooked in the stove outside. Shumimaru squinted happily when I brought the finished product in.<br/>
Ai Fa who was in the seat of honor sat with one knee up and frowned.<br/>
"… Asuta, I noticed that you used that red fruit again."<br/>
"Yes, but I didn’t make the food too spicy, so don’t worry. It doesn’t look as spicy as "Kiba Chitto", correct?"<br/>
"It’s the same, it’s entirely red."<br/>
"I told you it is fine. It’s red because of the tarapa."<br/>
And as a special service, Ai Fa’s portion was made to be milder.<br/>
I smiled at the scowling Ai Fa, scooped up the vegetable stew I heated up at the stove in the house, and then returned to my seat.<br/>
The side dish was the usual grilled poitan and kiba soup seasoned with Tau sauce. I added thigh meat, aria, and Chitto into the soup. The taste was similar to Kenchin soup, and I wondered if this dish would be popular in the 《Big Tree of the South Inn》.<br/>
The main dish was grilled meat with Chitto.<br/>
How should I name it? If I had to call it something, "Kiba sauté- Arrabbiata style"would be appropriate. This was the result of my research for a dish that was on par with the "Kiba Chitto" made with pickled Chitto.<br/>
Chitto fruit was an ingredient similar to chili in both color and spiciness. It was spherical and about the size of a soybean. Two or three of it were equivalent to one red chili, so it wasn’t too expensive either.<br/>
I sliced the Chitto and myam and then fried it with kiba oil over a small fire. I thought about using vegetable oil as a replacement for olive oil, but I couldn’t find any vegetable oil in the Post Station Town. I wondered if there was any inside the city.<br/>
The myam gave a nice fragrance when fried over a weak fire. I then shifted it to a mid-fire stove and quickly cooked the sliced kiba loin meat and aria. After the meat was cooked, I poured tarapa sauce that was stewing in another pot, and it was done.<br/>
When in doubt I would turn to tarapa. After the tarapa vegetable stew and "Kiba burger", I made the third dish with tarapa sauce. I wanted to add more variety, but, given how well the tomato-like tarapa meshed with the chili-like Chitto, this vegetable dish was the best choice.<br/>
If I let Leina Wu take over part of the preparation work, I could use my free time to try more ingredients. In short, if I could bring the tarapa sauce I made ahead of time to town, I could shorten the time spent in the 《Cryptic Venerable Inn》 greatly.<br/>
I had to pay due care and attention to the heat strength. I needed to heat the Chitto long enough to bring out its spiciness and had to take care not to let it turn mushy. With that in mind, cooking it was a simple matter.<br/>
"I plan to sell this dish in the 《Cryptic Venerable Inn》 next month. I will be delighted if Shumimaru can taste this dish before leaving Genos."<br/>
"Happy, I am too."<br/>
Ai Fa scowled her mouth, as if implying she was the only unhappy one.<br/>
But the dish today wouldn’t be spicy enough to make her cry. I added less Chitto into Ai Fa’s share and even removed the seeds, so the taste should be mild. I held expectations in my heart that this meal might make Ai Fa happy.<br/>
Ai Fa mumbled something quietly, while I said: "Rub a dub dub, thanks for the grub."; Shumimaru said: "Thank you for the meal." and after all three of us said grace in our own way, we started to dine.<br/>
I scooped up a spoonful of the main dish and sent it to my mouth.<br/>
And I tilted my head with a: "Huh?"<br/>
The tomato-like tarapa sauce was cooked together with the diced aria and fruit wine, so the style and sweetness were just perfect. The fragrance of the myam and the spiciness of the Chitto mixed together harmoniously, giving it a texture that was on par with "Kiba Chitto".<br/>
The source of this thick texture was the kiba.<br/>
The loin meat known for its tenderness had great texture. The crunchy aria was a fine too.<br/>
But this taste felt less strong than I remembered.<br/>
It was spicy, but it was the milder version, closer to what I made for Ai Fa.<br/>
My taste buds had probably grown blunt after tasting so many different dishes. I was a little worried about my dish and stole a peek at Shumimaru.<br/>
"Erm, sorry, but does it taste too bland?"<br/>
"No, delicious it is."<br/>
Shumimaru was already trying the tender grilled meat. I felt relieved after seeing him squint his eyes happily.<br/>
What about Ai Fa? I turned my gaze towards her… and found Ai Fa holding the plate with quivering shoulders.<br/>
"… Asuta, you lied to me."<br/>
"Hmm? What’s the matter? It’s not as spicy as before, correct?"<br/>
After saying that, I noticed.<br/>
The dish I ate was the milder one.<br/>
"Ah, did I mixed up our plates?"<br/>
No, I couldn’t have messed that up. Aside from Shumimaru, whether this dish would please Ai Fa was the thing which was most important to me.<br/>
I tilted my head and wondered what was going on, and Shumimaru did the same.<br/>
"Asuta, Ai Fa, plate taste, different?"<br/>
"Yes. I added less Chitto in Ai Fa’s share…"<br/>
"Ai Fa, plate, switch."<br/>
"Huh?"<br/>
"When Asuta, soup take, from stove, back face us. Ai Fa plate switch, then."<br/>
"What!? Why did Ai Fa do that!?"<br/>
"Ash, from stove, Asuta plate, fell. Ai Fa, remove ash, plate switch."<br/>
So ash from the stove fell onto my plate. Ai Fa noticed it, so she cleared away the ash and switched my share with hers, huh.<br/>
What a gentle house head!<br/>
The gods were cruel to let such a gentle and kind house head suffer like this.<br/>
"Sorry,  Ai Fa, this is your actual share… That hurts!"<br/>
She pinched my left cheek hard.<br/>
And she kept crying as she pinched me.<br/>
"It’s all your fault for changing the taste! Don’t do unnecessary things, moron!"<br/>
"But if it all tastes the same, it will be spicy for everyone… Hey, that really hurts!"<br/>
"I’m the one who is hurting!"<br/>
She was going to tear my cheek off.<br/>
But my gentle house head let go before the skin came off.<br/>
I was driven to tears just like my beloved mistress. This was all because we were concerned about each other; I could only lament this illogical world.<br/>
Ai Fa snorted like a kid beside me and wiped her tears with the back of her palm. Shumimaru said calmly while observing her cuteness: "Blissful, two of you are."<br/>
"I, family, no have. I think, blissful, Asuta and Ai Fa is."<br/>
"Huh? Shumimaru’s family had also passed on?"<br/>
"Yes. Mother, died, soon after I born. Father, passed, three years ago. I then, ‘Silver Vase’ leader, inherit."<br/>
"Ah, so the previous band leader was Shumimaru’s father."<br/>
After switching plates with Ai Fa, I endured the spiciness as I answered.<br/>
"‘Silver Vase’, my father, founded. I, ten years, work. Permission, work, Genos city, five years… I know Lord Pyschkurewuss, then."<br/>
Ai Fa who was drinking the soup with teary eyes raised her eyebrow.<br/>
"Easterner, so you are acquainted with the noble Pyschkurewuss from the city?"<br/>
"Yes. Through chef, in city, know Pyschkurewuss. Since 5 years, Pyschkurewuss, buy blades, many."<br/>
Ai Fa gave me a death stare, so I answered quickly: "I only learned about this today."<br/>
But why was Shumimaru mentioning this again?<br/>
"Lord Pyschkurewuss, break contract. Many, rumors, bad. Rumors, I not sure, but friend chef, scared, Lord Pyschkurewuss. Lord Pyschkurewuss, powerful."<br/>
"… And so?"<br/>
"Defy, Lord Pyschkurewuss, danger. I worry, denizens of Forest’s Edge."<br/>
Shumimaru shouldn’t have heard the conversation with the tribal chiefs just now. But he probably sensed danger from the questions I asked during the journey back from the Post Station Town.<br/>
"Anyway… This has nothing to do with you, easterner. You might be Asuta’s friend, but that’s exactly why you shouldn’t get involved with some things."<br/>
Ai Fa shook her head a little and picked up the plate with grilled meat.<br/>
"You are leaving the Post Station Town in a few days, right? Then don’t bother with all this and worry more about yourself."<br/>
"Yes. I know… what to do, I need."<br/>
Shumimaru lowered his gaze with a little loneliness in his eyes.<br/>
Ai Fa grunted softly and then put the meat covered in red sauce in her mouth.<br/>
She then started tearing up.<br/>
"Huh? Is it still spicy? I already added much less spices."<br/>
"… The first mouthful was already painful, and it’s hurting me more now."<br/>
Ai Fa kicked my knee while seated.<br/>
But she didn’t put down the plate but carried on eating as she wiped her tears.<br/>
"Hmm… I don’t know if it tastes good… If the first mouthful wasn’t so painful, I would definitely have found it tasty…"<br/>
"Really? That makes me really happy."<br/>
I couldn’t help smiling.<br/>
She then kicked me harder many more times.<br/>
"I think, Asuta, Ai Fa, blissful."<br/>
Shumimaru said the same thing again.<br/>
"This bliss, please treasure. I pray, you two, on journey."<br/>
Ai Fa’s face turned as red as tarapa sauce as she said: "Annoying" loudly.<br/>
Time then passed slowly and leisurely until Shumimaru left the Fa house.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
