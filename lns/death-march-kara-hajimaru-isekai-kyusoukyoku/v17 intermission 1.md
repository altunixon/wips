Intermission: Little Goddess<br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
"Demon God, you ok?"<br/>
"Parion huh."<br/>
"Un."<br/>
<br/>
Demon God raised his body in his luxurious bed.<br/>
He's currently resting in order to remove the impurities he got from fusing with the [Poisonous Satou], a trap set up by the pantheon.<br/>
<br/>
Demon God stopped Parion as she was about to innocently hug him like she usually does.<br/>
<br/>
"Why?"<br/>
<br/>
Parion asked the reason since Demon God would usually be delighted whenever she hugs him when they're in material forms.<br/>
<br/>
"You'd get infected with the impurities."<br/>
"...Uh huh."<br/>
<br/>
It seems she's still not used to her newly created body, her face is all wriggly like 'poyayan'.<br/>
<br/>
"But I'm impressed you managed to get this far."<br/>
<br/>
Impressed that she was able to reach the deepest part of Netherworld filled to the brim with demons who absolutely loath gods without causing even a single commotion.<br/>
<br/>
"Authorities, cultivated."<br/>
"I see, good girl Parion"<br/>
<br/>
Praised by Demon God, Parion puffed her chest triumphantly.<br/>
An unfamiliar object came into Parion's view.<br/>
<br/>
"What is that?"<br/>
<br/>
Parion shifted her attention toward a pearl scythe clad in rainbow colored lights decorating the bedroom.<br/>
<br/>
"『Godreaping Scythe』--a weapon capable of slaying gods."<br/>
"Slaying gods?"<br/>
<br/>
Parion took the scythe in her arm as she muttered.<br/>
It appears to be too heavy to Parion's body, she's staggering around dangerously.<br/>
<br/>
"That thing is dangerous, put it back Parion."<br/>
"Gotta go kill first before that."<br/>
<br/>
Parion unsteadily takes a stance with the scythe.<br/>
<br/>
"That is still incomplete."<br/>
"Why?"<br/>
<br/>
Parion tilted her head like 'poyayan'.<br/>
<br/>
"That doesn't yet have Divinity in."<br/>
"How do you put it in?"<br/>
"That weapon is the reason why I created Purple Towers, to collect divinity. They will have enough to fill it up in 10,000 years."<br/>
"Why not use Nymphs' Divinity?"<br/>
"Nymphs have too little Divinity to matter. Even all of them together won't be enough to fill this scythe up."<br/>
"How much it needs?"<br/>
"About one god's worth of amount."<br/>
<br/>
Parion's eyes opened wide to hear such an enormous amount.<br/>
<br/>
"What to do."<br/>
<br/>
Parion tilted her head and her body with furrowed brows.<br/>
She never thought the completion of a god-slaying weapon requires the contradictory action of slaying a god first.<br/>
<br/>
"I'll come, again."<br/>
<br/>
Parion left Demon God's palace after murmuring that.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
◇<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
"Demon God. I thought up of a good idea."<br/>
<br/>
Parion immediately got straight to the point on her second visit.<br/>
Demon God isn't sleeping in his bed today, apparently the poison inserted in the fake Satou has gone already.<br/>
<br/>
"Welcome, Parion. What is this good idea of yours?"<br/>
"Let's use White Radiant Crystal."<br/>
"--White Radiant Crystal? That thing hidden in the innermost part of God's Realm huh..."<br/>
"Un."<br/>
<br/>
Demon God realized that god Parion was telling him to use the White Radiant Crystal to charge the Godreaping Scythe when he saw her glancing over at the scythe.<br/>
<br/>
"Enough?"<br/>
"The crystallization of Divinity [White Radiant Crystal] will indeed suffice... But I cannot agree to that."<br/>
"Why?"<br/>
"That crystal is needed for the protection of human world on top of God's Realm."<br/>
<br/>
It's the [Seven Gods' Barrier] that's protecting the human world from the threat of [Outsiders] wandering in the void sky, and the White Radiant Crystal is a booster that converges the power to make that a reality.<br/>
<br/>
That's the extent of Demon God's knowledge on it.<br/>
<br/>
"It's OK."<br/>
<br/>
Parion threw out her chest confidently.<br/>
<br/>
"Is that so?"<br/>
"Everyone can just deliver. Everyone is hiding spare Divinity."<br/>
<br/>
Parion insisted that the gods could make a new White Radiant Crystal if they all just put together their hidden stash of Divinity.<br/>
<br/>
"Our ambition can be realized then."<br/>
<br/>
Demon God ponders. He could free humanity from god's reign if he used the [Godreaping Scythe] to threaten those gods.<br/>
Just what's in the mind of the smiling Parion--.<br/>
<br/>
"Let's do it."<br/>
"Very well. I'm counting on you to guide me to Realm of Gods."<br/>
"Count on me."<br/>
<br/>
Thus a tag team of Demon God and Parion was formed, and the theft of White Radiant Crystal from Realm of God was carried out.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
◇<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
"Demon God, you OK?"<br/>
"...Pa-Parion."<br/>
"Un."<br/>
<br/>
Demon God couldn't even afford to raise his body off his bed as he looked up at Parion in pain.<br/>
The divinity overflowing out of his body is far beyond the usual amount, but it's stagnant like a black sludge.<br/>
<br/>
The impure miasma fog covering the whole Netherworld was apparently all from the Demon God.<br/>
<br/>
"What happened?"<br/>
"Those gods got me good. The White Radiant Crystal had Malice in it."<br/>
<br/>
Malice--The [Forbidden Power] sealed in the moon.<br/>
Demon God was saying someone had put it in the White Radiant Crystal.<br/>
<br/>
He probably needed to take the Divinity into his body before he could unload it into the scythe.<br/>
<br/>
"Who did?"<br/>
"Most likely Zaikuon. He's the only one who would do such a self-sabotaging foolish act among those gods."<br/>
"Uh huh."<br/>
<br/>
God Parion nodded with her 'poyayan' face.<br/>
<br/>
"Has it been filled with Divinity?"<br/>
<br/>
God Parion asked while pointing at the [Godreaping Scythe].<br/>
<br/>
"It hasn't."<br/>
<br/>
Discontent dwelt in god Parion's face once she heard Demon God's reply.<br/>
<br/>
"Why?"<br/>
"If I did that, the 『Godreaping Scythe』 would be defiled by the impurities too. It would have been a repeat of last time."<br/>
"Uh huh."<br/>
<br/>
God Parion walks toward the [Godreaping Scythe].<br/>
A demon in the form of a saintess stood before Parion just as she stretched out her hand toward the scythe.<br/>
<br/>
"Move."<br/>
"You must not."<br/>
"I can't kill without that."<br/>
<br/>
The saintess is looking at the [Gimme] god Parion with a troubled look.<br/>
The saintess's guard was impeccable, she blocked all attempts god Parion made to take the scythe.<br/>
<br/>
"Stop, Parion. There's no need for you to get revenge on Zaikuon."<br/>
"But."<br/>
"Don't worry. My trusted retainers are currently making scapegoats to transfer the impurities over. Let's think about threatening those gods afterward."<br/>
"Okay."<br/>
<br/>
Parion nodded reluctantly.<br/>
<br/>
"Leave Netherworld, Parion."<br/>
"Why?"<br/>
"I cannot hold back the impurities at this rate."<br/>
<br/>
If he failed at holding it back, the netherworld will be contaminated by impurities severe enough to defile a goddess like her.<br/>
Demon God fears that his power would end up defiling the little goddess.<br/>
<br/>
"I cannot let human world be defiled either. I must shut the gates to the human world before that happens. Leave Netherworld before the gates are shut."<br/>
<br/>
Demon God is apparently aware that she makes a transit at the human world whenever she visits Netherworld.<br/>
<br/>
"I'll come again."<br/>
<br/>
After saying that with her poyayan-face, god Parion left Demon God.<br/>
<br/>
Thanks to her Authorities, none of the demons coming and going in the passages she takes notices her.<br/>
<br/>
"A scapegoat to transfer impurities over..."<br/>
<br/>
God Parion murmured.<br/>
<br/>
"...There is one."<br/>
<br/>
Parion knew.<br/>
That the Satou Demon God took in was a fake other gods had created.<br/>
<br/>
Parion didn't tell him.<br/>
Since she thought that Demon God was already a perfect form that didn't need Satou.<br/>
<br/>
Parion mulls.<br/>
Demon God's Uniform Body that's in the human world will fit best as a scapegoat to transfer the impurities over.<br/>
<br/>
Parion plots.<br/>
A way to bring the Uniform Body to Netherworld in order to transfer the impurities.<br/>
<br/>
"--There."<br/>
<br/>
There stood one of the pink-haired little girls in Parion's vision.<br/>
She's one of the girls who have been pointlessly moving about in the corridors while saying stuff like, "Oh no~", "What should we do~" restlessly.<br/>
<br/>
Parion approaches the little girl who has strayed off from her group.<br/>
<br/>
She fixes up her 'poyayan' face while moving, putting up a face befitting of a goddess.<br/>
She hasn't lived for 100 million years for nothing. So long as she wills it, Parion is capable of playing the act of a sublime goddess.<br/>
<br/>
"You, yes you girl, do you wish to save Demon God?"<br/>
"--Who?"<br/>
"I am an old friend of Demon God."<br/>
<br/>
The little girl relaxes her guard at Parion's gentle voice.<br/>
<br/>
"I shall give a mission to you who loves Demon God the most among all his familiars."<br/>
"Mission?"<br/>
"You can save Demon God if you do as you're told."<br/>
"Truly?!"<br/>
"Yes, I promise. Will you undertake this mission?"<br/>
"Un!"<br/>
<br/>
Thus, god Parion cunningly sent a poor lamb to where Satou was at the human world.<br/>
<br/>
She even gave her an authority to wrench open the shut gates.<br/>
Even though there is no way a god like her isn't aware that doing so would bring the impurities over to the human world.<br/>
<br/>
"Kufuu, kufufufufu."<br/>
<br/>
Parion laughed innocently.<br/>
<br/>
"I will finally get my hands on it. 『Godreaping Scythe』--a weapon to slay gods."<br/>
<br/>
Parion's whisper disappeared into the rift without ever reaching anyone's ear.<br/>
Nobody knows the true nature of god Parion.<br/>
<br/>
