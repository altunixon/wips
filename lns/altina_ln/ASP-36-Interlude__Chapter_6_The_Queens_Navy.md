Interlude
Translator: MythosIX
Editor: Skythewood, Darkdhaos
On the last day of the anniversary, the capital had a more lively atmosphere than usual.
Under the oil lamp bright light, a group of tattered knights were moving on the street.
The people who were in a festival mood were stunned seeing this as they had stopped singing, some even had their wine bottle slipped off their hand.
The sight of the knights who were advancing while dragging their feet.
They had a lifeless look as if they lost a war.
Is that really the symbol of the empire’s strength, the First Army?
There were well-informed people that had confirmed the news.
“I heard that their opponent was the hero Jerome from Marie Quatre army!”
The tavern was a place where intelligence was exchanged due to the large flow of people. People gathered after hearing this news.
“Is it a civil war or a rebellion?”
“No~pe, prince Auguste gave up his inheritance rights and recommended the 4th princess instead! Hence, Prince Latreille sent the First Army but was defeated!”
“Even if they are the Black Knight Order, that’s too unbelievable!”
“That’s because in Marie Quate Army, there is the strategist Regis. People who witnessed the fight said that he seemed to use magic to set the wetland ablaze, trapping the knights in the fire.”
“Magic, is it?... … That might be true as he commanded only 2000 people to conquer Volk Fortress.”
“I, heard that it’s just 200.”
“There’s no way that it can be 200, you fool!”
“Although prince Latreille said that he will definitely inherit the throne, but… If a war happens, it will be nice if the Marie Quatre army win.”
“What are you saying? If prince Latreille didn’t win, this nation won’t be called Belgaria.”
“Now is the time for the people to grasp the power from the nation.”
“Shut up, you fool!”
“Absolutely not… ...”
“W,wait… …”
The venue was starting to be chaotic, it seemed like it would take some time before things settled down.
Imperial Palace Le Brane——
There was not a single noble who dared to break the rules at the venue used for the banquet.
Prince Auguste giving up his rights and elected princess Argentina as the first candidate in line.
Following that, the First Army was mobilised and it was clear that the knights were defeated.
The prospects that the nobles had predicted was overturned in a single night. Now, they gathered their companions and were discussing their future actions.
The wine bottle that was not even half empty was lifted. Crimson liquid was poured into a glass from the bottle.
“...”
Latreille was sitting there.
There was someone trembling beside him.
The orangish-yellow hair had turned white.
He was Germain.
“M,my lord… …”
“What is it, my strategist?”
“A,at the very least, please end me personally.”
Germain kneeled down.
His shoulders was trembling non-stop.
Latreille shook the glass and tasted the wine.
“Punishment? Have you committed any crime~?”
“... I,I, because I wanted to make up for my loss, I mobilised the First Army.”
“Ahh, it seems there is that. Not only that, the First Army was defeated. The whole capital are discussing about this. Huhu, that strategist really is a demon.”
“I have betrayed… B,betrayed Your Highness’ trust in me.”
“Hmm, I’m not suited to be the emperor, isn’t that what those nobles are saying?”
“Ku… …”
Germain whose hair had turned white was sobbing.
Latreille finished drinking the wine in the glass.
“Huhuhu, why are you saying all this, Germain? No matter what happened, it’s all my sin, so why is it that you need to be punished?”
“... W,why?”
Germain lifted his head.
Latreille once again filled the glass in his hand with wine.
The overflowing wine spilled onto the floor.
The red liquid slowly stained a large area of the floor.
The confused Germain looked at the red stained floor.
“Uuh... ”
“Similar to this, water that was spilled cannot be drunk. However, if there is a glass, we can pour the wine into it again.”
The empty glass was filled to the brim once more.
“How is it, Germain? The colour of the wine after spilling and before spilling is different, and the taste is also different, right?”
“... I,it’s different.”
“Isn’t it? Just that is it necessary to throw away the wine glass because some a glass of wine was spilled? What we should do now, is to pour new wine into the glass. Do you understand that, Germain? Please do not forget that both you and I are on the same boat.”
“O,oooooooh~~~~”
Germain was moved to tears.
Latreille just shook the glass, looking out of the window to the shimmering street light.
Chapter 6 The Queen's Navy 
One week later——
Volk Fortress
After lunch, Regis was going to the commander’s room while holding intelligence report.
The door to the room was half-opened.
Humming could be heard coming from the inside.
“Hmm~ hmm~”
Regis looked into the room from the gap, a brown eyed, brown haired maid was currently wiping the desk.
She was singing while doing a turn happily.
She is still cleaning with such a cheery mood. Ah, it feels like it will be troublesome if I enter now.
“...”
“Hmm~ La la la~ Regis~ love to peep~”
“W,wait?! Couldn’t you say a word if you know that I’m here?”
“Ara, you’re here, good afternoon, Regis.”
“... … Why are you pretending that you just noticed me… …”
“If it’s about the meeting, it hasn’t started yet, so why are you so early?”
“Although it has yet to begin, I need some time to sort the report. If the report is too long, Jerome will be unhappy about it, while Altina… She might even fall asleep.”
“Well, hehe, it seems that everyone is enthusiastic about this.”
“Really, that’s really so.”
“Ara, Regis, should those words be told to them?”
“... … … Wait, it feels like something important in my heart was broken.”
Clarisse whose hand was using the table as a support, began laughing.
“There’s not going to be a problem, Regis. Altina and the rest will listen to your suggestion.”
“I,is that so?”
“Yes, the princess didn’t escape after hearing the menu after all.”
“... … That’s because clothings, food and shelter are important. Living is a tough thing after all.”
“Could it be that you pay attention to what you eat?”
“Of course…”
That reminds Regis about his breakfast this morning.
Lately, Regis' appetite was rather good as there were not much books to read or administrative work. Neither was there any business for Regis to go out for.
“... … Ah, I’m sorry for not expressing gratitude to you before eating.”
“Fufu, why would I blame you over this kind of things… That reminds me, I heard something interesting from the princess.”
“Eh? What is it?”
“That Regis prefer older woman.”
“Ahhh, that…”
Regis was used to this, Clarisse will definitely use that to tease me, was what he thought.
Clarisse was unsatisfied after seeing Regis’ reaction.
“How calm.”
“Age doesn’t matter to me, that’s right, I also feel bad for panicking easily… That should be Eleanor’s problem, moreover, she already has three husbands.”
“Even though the two of you kissed?”
“Didn’t I say it? It was her way of cracking a joke.”
I see, I see. Clarisse shown a look as if she understood it.
She should understand this by now.
Seems like the conversation ended, I’m relieved.
“In other words, it’s fine to kiss you if it’s not a joke?”
“Eh?”
Not knowing when, Clarisse’s hand was already on Regis’ cheek.
“I am also joking, it should be fine to report this to the princess.”
“Wait, ah, no… … I don’t think this is a good idea even for a joke.”
“Ara, so it’s fine if it’s serious?”
“Eeh? W,what do you mean?”
Regis fixed his gaze at Clarisse.
The distance between their face was very close, Regis could see his own reflection from Clarisse’s eyes.
Clarisse is really a beauty, Regis thought.
Regis could felt Clarisse’s breathing.
A passionate voice came out from Clarisse’s mouth.
“Huhu~, it’s fine, right? Regis, are you prepared?”
“... That… … I never once thought that you will want to kiss someone like me.”
“That, can I take it as a yes?”
Regis fell into deep thoughts.
He was searching for an answer in his bookshelf before finding a suitable answer.
“... If you are just joking, it’s better not to do these kind of jokes, you should cherish yourself even more.”
“What if it’s not a joke?”
“If you are serious, then all the more I wish that your cherish yourself. You are still young and beautiful, hence you should choose a better partner.”
Clarisse frowned.
Is she angry because I lectured her?
“... … Well, a person like me that has uncertain future, no matter how one see…I have neither strength nor wealth and I couldn’t even ride a horse.” 
“Really, Regis doesn’t understand anything.”
“Eh?”
Clarisse then moved her finger from Regis’ cheek to his lip, causing him to be embarrassed.
Regis unknowingly straighten his posture.
“Let me tell you one thing… … You never once view woman as a thing or an animal, but also never depend on them. You don’t yell out when you’re in a bad mood, neither do you get violent when drunk.”
“Ahh, I think that my sister did all that.”
“What an incredible teacher, in  the other way of speaking.”
“Hahaha… Well, even if that is the case, I was raised well. I’m very grateful to her.”
The reason why I’m not used to females who are older than me is also because of her.
As Regis continued to talk, Clarisse touched Regis’ ear.
It's itchy.
“Belgaria is a nation that emphasise on military, rational men like you are very rare.”
“Well, like I said… I’m already aware that I’m too weak for a man. It’s fine.”
Clarisse was discouraged as if she was defeated by Regis.
Huh? Regis tilted his head in confusion.
As the sound of the footsteps drew nearer, Altina finally appeared.
“Ara, so early? And I thought that I was the first. Right, have you heard of it? That the underground water system actually contain fishes!! It’s rather big too! Next time I catch them, I will have the chef roast them.”
Seeing Altina appeared, Clarisse went and hugged her.
“Uuhh… … Only the princess can heal me.”
“Uh, eh? Like I said, the fish...”
“Yes, yes.”
As the three were chatting, Jerome, Abidal Evra and Eric came one after another.
Felicia who was acting as Auguste and Eddie appeared too.
“That, is it fine for me to be here?”
“That should be my line, is there anything I can do here?”
“... It’s fine even if you do nothing. We will be troubled if the real identity of prince Auguste is exposed. You already helped us by staying here temporary. In addition, there is also some things that requires your help.”
“Don’t worry about it and just ask us, we also wish to repay the favour.”
“Eh? There isn’t a need… Rather, it should be me instead. To successfully counter Latreille’s scheme, it was all thanks  to Your Highness Auguste and Sir Eddie's assistance.”
“That reminds me, I heard that you like to play chess, why don’t you have a match with me?”
“Really? That’s great!”
As both of them were the type that like to stay at home, both Regis and Felicia were able to get along easily.
Altina who saw this development lightly elbowed Regis.
“Regis, that, do you like to fish?”
“Eh? Fishing??! That…”
“Haa~!!!! So, you're one of those that prefers them younger!?”
“... Please calm down Altina, think before you say anything, please have a seat there.”
“Hmph.”
Don, Jerome put the shortsword on the table and said,
“Hurry and begin the meeting.”
“Y,yes.”
Everyone hurried and sat on their designated seats.
It was getting foggy.
Chaineboule which the Trouin House controlled was a medium sized city with a rather large harbour.
A naval base was also located there. Inside the base, there were 3 warship and 10 cannons. The relationship was good with the neighbouring country, High Britannia, which was separated by a sea. 
For the past few years, war did not occur there.
However, since half a month ago, the empire’s second army has been stationed there, causing the neighbouring country to be unhappy about.
In the morning 7 o’clock——
It was about time for fisherman to return to the port.
It was not very visible near the sea due to the fog. There should not be any trouble as the sea was calm at the moment and the port should have lighted up a fire. This was such a situation.
Rodolphe who was on duty stood on the wooden stage as usual, looking for the town. Rodolphe was a young merchant who worked at the port. He was twenty this year, not a soldier, but a merchant.
“I can’t see anything at all…”
Visibility was bad due to the fog.
On day like this, it was easy for two boat to collide.
Rodolphe’s sense of hearing was more sensitive than his sense of sight.
He heard an unfamiliar sound.
It sounded like a giant creature breathing.
The sea  was stirred, something unknown was moving close to the harbour.
“... This is?”
In the fog, a giant shadow slowly appeared.
“A ship?”
However, there was no sail.
A ship in distress?
It does not seems like it.
The ship in front of Rodolphe slowly revealed its identity.
There was a large pillar on the large ship. Black smoke was coming out of the pillar.
——Steam-powered ship
Rodolphe took some time to recall the name of this ship from a rumour he heard.
Although Belgaria tried to construct one, nobody at the port saw this thing before. Moreover, the nation's technology was not advanced enough.
A roaring sound like a thunderbolt resounded. 
The warships stationed in the naval base was basked in light.
It exploded.
The shock wave from the explosion even affected the observation post which was quite a distance away.
“Ughh!?”
Compared to the merchant Rodolphe who was stunned seeing this, the soldiers had already reacted.
Everyone were escaping out of the camp.
The 10 cannons that were arranged in a line at the port also began to fire.
However, it was just the sound of the cannon firing.
The cannonball could not hit the enemy ship.
The mysterious ship once again fired, the other warships in the port also got destroyed. The Belgaria ships were getting destroyed one-sidedly.
What an overwhelming firepower.
Moreover, the giant ship moved freely even without wind.
Not only is it fast.
It’s also agile.
Rodolphe stood there in a daze from the start to the end.
The warship was in flames, all was destroyed. Even the cannon was in bad condition.
The witless soldiers continued to use their gun to shoot at the enemy’s cannon.
The scene made people think they were witnessing God’s Wrath.
Belgaria’s military was being ravaged by such advanced technology.
Under the constant barrage, the mysterious ship slowly got closer.
The veil of fog was also slowly dissipating.
Rodolphe stared at the battlefield, it seems what he thought was correct.
The flag on the steam-powered boat belongs to High Britannia, the flag of a country that ruled by the queen.
Belgaria’s western port was decimated in about half an hour
As expected of the Queen’s navy.
Suddenly, the ship fired a cannonball in Rodolphe's direction.
