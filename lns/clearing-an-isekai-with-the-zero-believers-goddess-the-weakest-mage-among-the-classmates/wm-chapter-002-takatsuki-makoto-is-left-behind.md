<br/>
"Hey there, Takatsuki-kun, you are up." <br/>
While I was spaced out thinking, someone spoke to me.<br/>
A refreshing handsome man, who had two beauties at his sides, was right in front of me..<br/>
Well, they are my classmates.<br/>
Sakurai Ryosuke.<br/>
A central figure of the class and was the ace of the soccer club. <br/>
A honest to word normie.<br/>
"Sakurai-kun, huh. Yeah, thankfully." <br/>
"That’s a relief. I heard that you didn’t seem to be waking up, so I was worried." (Sakurai)<br/>
"Aah, thanks for the worry." <br/>
I honestly am not good at dealing with him.<br/>
He is the complete opposite of someone like me.<br/>
"Have you heard about your Stats and Skills?" (Sakurai)<br/>
"Well, yeah." <br/>
I easily told him about my own skills.<br/>
He also told me his.<br/>
Sakurai-kun has the Light Hero skill.<br/>
The two girls behind him have Sage and Holy Knight.<br/>
They all hit jackpots.<br/>
"By the way, want to join our party?" (Sakurai)<br/>
"Huh?" <br/>
What’s this all of a sudden?<br/>
"Eeh, Takatsuki-kun?", the one who said this was Kawamoto Eris-san.<br/>
"Takatsuki-kun has a different party, right?", the other girl, Yokoyama Saki-san.<br/>
Both of them are beauties.<br/>
"Actually, I am going to be leaving tomorrow. A variety of people have been inviting me." (Sakurai)<br/>
"Tomorrow? Isn’t that too soon?" <br/>
Weren’t we all supposed to be learning here?<br/>
"Ryosuke is the Light Hero, so he doesn’t need to train." <br/>
"He has been recommended as a candidate for the knight captain of the Sun Country." <br/>
Kawamoto-san and Yokoyama-san were saying this with ecstatic expressions.<br/>
"How about you come together with us, Takatsuki-kun?" (Sakurai)<br/>
An invitation to his party, huh…<br/>
"There’s unknown people all around, so I think it would be better if we help each other out." (Sakurai)<br/>
Sakurai says this with an innocent expression.<br/>
"Hmm." <br/>
I ponder.<br/>
It doesn’t sound bad.<br/>
No, wait. Even if I were to go with them, the current me would only manage to be a luggage carrier. <br/>
At worst, a gofer.<br/>
Sakurai-kun seems to be a good guy, so he wouldn’t do that, but the beauties at both of his sides were looking at me and telling me with their eyes: ((Refuse already)).<br/>
"Thanks for the invitation, but I will be learning here for a while." <br/>
"I see, that’s a shame. It can’t be helped." (Sakurai)<br/>
He said this in disappointment.<br/>
"If Takatsuki-kun says so, it can’t be helped. Ah, right, how about having you teach him swordsmanship, Saki-chan? Stay here for a while." <br/>
Kawamoto-san says something weird.<br/>
"Then, wouldn’t it be better for you to teach him magic, Eri-chan?" <br/>
Yokoyama-san immediately shoots back.<br/>
"What, don’t go saying stupid things." <br/>
"Right back at you." <br/>
""Fufufufu.""<br/>
Kawamoto-san and Yokoyama-san at a glance may look like they get along, but it seems like they have a pretty thorny relationship.<br/>
The man, who is the most likely reason for this, doesn’t seem to notice the strange atmosphere though.<br/>
"Then, if you ever change your mind, feel free to tell me, okay?" (Sakurai)<br/>
He leaves as eloquently as he came.<br/>
Kawamoto-san and Yokoyama-san didn’t say anything.<br/>
Ah, the two girls glared at me for a moment.<br/>
I think I heard them click their tongues. <br/>
Cat fights are scary. <br/>
Sakurai-kun, you might get stabbed in the back someday. <br/>
I’m a bit worried.<br/>
◇◇<br/>
"Hey there, Takatsuki." <br/>
After a while, another group speaks to me.<br/>
"I heard you have the weakest element, Water Magic?" <br/>
"Moreover, elementary grade? Fufu!" <br/>
"No, even worse are his stats. He seriously is a commoner." <br/>
A flashy guy that is friends with Kitayama, Okada; and a gyaru named Kawakita-san. <br/>
There’s also Kitayama.<br/>
These 3 are usually together at school too.<br/>
When all three gather, they look like a group of yankees.<br/>
In other words, people I am not good at dealing with.<br/>
"Hey hey, what profession will you be taking?" <br/>
Okada says with a grin.<br/>
"I still haven’t decided. What about you, Okada-kun?" <br/>
"Me? I will be a warrior! I am gonna butcher monsters with my [Great Sword: Superior Grade]!" <br/>
"I have the [Grand Mage] skill. I can use Fire, Water, Wood, and Earth at High Grade! Isn’t that impressive?"<br/>
I didn’t ask you, Kawakita-san, is what I was thinking, but I at least give her a: "Wow, that’s impressive". <br/>
So they are just here to brag.<br/>
"That’s nice, you all have skills you can use immediately. I am a Dragon Knight, so I apparently have to begin by catching a flying dragon. What a pain." <br/>
Kitayama says this, but he seems to be having fun.<br/>
"You also have [Spear User: High Grade] and [Heavenly Speed]! You have it nice!" <br/>
"Hey, if you catch a dragon, let me ride it, okay?" <br/>
"Yeah, leave it to me." <br/>
"Oi oi, don’t go seducing my woman." <br/>
"I am not!" <br/>
Okada and Kawakita-san were going out, huh.<br/>
I didn’t know.<br/>
In the end, they asked me practically nothing, and it ended with them just bragging.<br/>
◇◇<br/>
1 month since coming to this world.<br/>
⅓ of my classmates have been scouted by higher-ups of some country.  <br/>
The ones who disappeared immediately were people who had super powerful skills like the Light Hero.<br/>
It seems like when it comes to scouting, the fast one wins. A variety of people were coming and going.<br/>
Listening to the talks of those people, we began seeing the state of the continent. <br/>
The continent we are in is called the West Continent, and there’s 6 countries in it.<br/>
Summarizing it…<br/>
The Sun Country, Highland: the leading power of the continent. Has the most national power, with their population, military force, and financial affairs at the top ranks.<br/>
The Fire Country, Great Keith: Half of their country is deserts. Their martial arts is popular, and there’s a lot of beastkin and mercenaries.<br/>
The Water Country, Rozes: The country we are currently in. Their touristic industry is flourishing. Also, the power of the church is high.<br/>
The Wood Country, Spring Log: Most of the country is forests. The power of the elves is strong. There’s beastkin, too.<br/>
The Commercial Country, Camelot: Casinos and money lending is prosperous.<br/>
The Earth Country, Karilan: an underground country. The power of the dwarves is strong. Metal business is prosperous.<br/>
Something like that. The relationship between the 6 countries is decently good.<br/>
At the very least there’s no wars. <br/>
There was also a country called Lafilogue a long time ago that has fallen.<br/>
My classmates dispersed to different countries depending on the conditions of the scouts.<br/>
There were no scouts for me.<br/>
Haah.<br/>
I am currently taking a class for magic.<br/>
There’s not a single classmate from my previous world.<br/>
I am together with children in elementary school level. <br/>
"Takatsuki-san just came to this world. Everyone, get along with him, okay?" <br/>
""""Yees.""""<br/>
The children say this in chorus. <br/>
One high school student within the elementary school students.<br/>
Honestly speaking, it is embarrassing.<br/>
"Now then, today we will be learning about elements. This world has 7 elements, and all of them have their ups and downs." <br/>
The old lady teacher writes down the explanation on the blackboard. <br/>
Sun: Controls things like light, lightning, and wind.<br/>
Moon: Controls things like darkness, and death.<br/>
Fire: Controls things like flames, and heat.<br/>
Water: Controls things like water, ice, mist.<br/>
Wood: Controls things like animals, and poison.<br/>
Gold: Controls things like luck, and destiny.<br/>
Earth: Controls things like earth, stone, and metals.<br/>
"The 7 elements have their respective Goddesses. Aside from the Moon, the 6 elements are widely worshipped around the continent. As you may already know, Moon rules over darkness and death. You must not worship it, okay?" <br/>
"""Okaaay."""<br/>
"When using whichever magic, you will require mana. When using a strong spell, you will require a lot of mana, and because of that, you need to raise your level…" <br/>
The lesson continued.<br/>
First, I should work hard in learning.<br/>
◇◇<br/>
 3 months since coming to this world.<br/>
"Takki-dono, take care." (Fujiwara)<br/>
"Yeah, you as well, Fuji-yan." <br/>
Fuji-yan has been scouted.<br/>
It wasn’t an adventurer party, but a merchant company. <br/>
It seems like he formed a connection with a merchant that came to the Water Temple.<br/>
Fuji-yan really has a good head on his shoulders.<br/>
"I plan on working at Makkaren which is the closest city to the Water Temple. If you ever go there, please give me a call." (Fujiwara)<br/>
"Got it. If I go there, I will look for you." <br/>
"Then, please do your best in your training." (Fujiwara)<br/>
"Yeah, good luck to you too." <br/>
Fuji-yan and I exchange a tight handshake and separated.<br/>
I didn’t have many friends to begin with, but with Fuji-yan gone, my chances to speak with my classmates were practically gone. <br/>
More than half of the beginning members have left.<br/>
I am a bit lonely now.<br/>
"Makoto-niichan, have you gotten better at water magic?" <br/>
Lately, a boy I began getting along with after talking about my previous world has been my only talking partner.<br/>
It seems he is the third son of a noble somewhere.<br/>
 "[Water Ball]." <br/>
When I say this, a water ball the size of a softball was on top of my palm.<br/>
The process of magic is: Generate → Control.<br/>
And the process to activate Water Ball is: Water Generation → Water Control (Forming the shape of a ball).<br/>
The strength of the water generation depends on the mana of the user.<br/>
The control of the water depends on the proficiency of the magic.<br/>
My mana is elementary level, so it is astoundingly weak. <br/>
It takes my all to create a small water ball like this.<br/>
Fortunately, proficiency increases the more you use magic, so I am using magic everyday.<br/>
"Wow! You can do that much in just 3 months?! It took me 2 years. [Fireball]!" <br/>
A ball of fire the size of a basketball appears on the top of his palm.<br/>
Big.<br/>
It is around 5 times the size of mine.<br/>
I feel like crying.<br/>
The boy has [Fire Magic: Intermediate], [Swordsman: Intermediate]. He says all the time that he is going to become a magic swordsman.<br/>
I want to become a magic swordsman too…<br/>
Because I don’t have warrior skills, I cannot take jobs that are related to the warrior classes.<br/>
I have no choice but to work hard in being a mage.<br/>
"Makoto-niichan, let’s work hard!" <br/>
"Yeah", I nod weakly.<br/>
◇◇<br/>
Half a year has passed since coming to this world.<br/>
Almost no scouts are coming to the temple now. <br/>
The remaining classmates counting me have to begin thinking about what they should do themselves.<br/>
Or so I say, but they are people that have skills like [Swordsman: High] and [Mage: High], so there’s not much to be depressed about.<br/>
Aside from me.<br/>
Currently, I have begun to train in skills other than mage, like traveller and thief.<br/>
I was able to learn this thanks to my skill [RPG Player].<br/>
The skills of the traveller are [Dismantle], [Cooking], [Emergency Treatment], and [Tinder]. There’s a lot of skills that serve for journeys.<br/>
The thief skills are [Detection], [Trap Disable], [Evasion], and [Escape]. Its trait is that most skills are useful for detecting danger beforehand, and running away from the enemy.<br/>
They are necessary for someone like me who plans on acting solo.<br/>
◇◇<br/>
9 months have passed since coming to this world.<br/>
The remaining classmates are 3 including me.<br/>
There are no chances for us to meet.<br/>
I have been pouring all my time into training and the library.<br/>
It is to learn the language of this world.<br/>
If I can read the letters, I can read books.<br/>
I have no knowledge about this world.<br/>
The history of this world, the races, monsters, geography, diseases, etc.<br/>
I have to leave this place in 3 months. <br/>
I want to increase my knowledge of this world as much as possible.<br/>
I have investigated a bit about the history of this world.<br/>
The name of the era in this world is the Salvation Era. <br/>
Currently, it is the year 1001 of the Salvation Era.<br/>
The year 0 of the Salvation Era was when the Savior Abel defeated the Great Demon Lord.<br/>
Savior Abel.<br/>
According to history, it was a hero that held the two skills Light Hero and Lightning Hero.<br/>
A walking cheat.<br/>
The Savior Abel is the founder king of the strongest kingdom of the continent, Highland.<br/>
Defeating the demon lord and creating a country.<br/>
The classic hero.<br/>
The comrades of the Savior Abel created their respective countries. Like the Fire Country and the Water Country. <br/>
I managed to learn about the history of that time in detail thanks to the books of the library.<br/>
But the history before the year 0 is fragmented.<br/>
When the Great Demon Lord was present it was apparently a dark period where the continent was in his control.<br/>
Thanks to the Savior, we are in this era now.<br/>
◇◇<br/>
1 year has passed since coming to this world.<br/>
There’s no classmates anymore.<br/>
I am now the last one of the 1-A class.<br/>
