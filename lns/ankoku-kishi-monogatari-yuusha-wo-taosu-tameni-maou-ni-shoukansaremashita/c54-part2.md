Chapter 54.2 : Rescue Mission<br/>
I felt anxious. If even Heibos went to the extent of warning me, then Labrys must be extremely dangerous.<br/>
「Is Labrys… that powerful?」<br/>
「Yes, he is. He fought Modes and survived, after all.」<br/>
「I see…」<br/>
I couldn’t disagree with Heibos. If Labrys managed to survive a fight against Modes, then he truly was powerful. I’m not a match for Modes. I’m sure he’s more powerful than me. In fact, if I ever fight Modes, I don’t think I’ll be able to survive.<br/>
My anxiety only worsened.<br/>
「 On top of that, the labyrinth supposedly supplies an endless amount of power to him. As long as he’s inside the labyrinth, it’ll keep healing any wounds you manage to inflict on Labrys. How are you going to defeat him when the odds are not in your favour?」<br/>
As I pondered over Heibos’ question, I thought about how Modes seemed to be relieved when I said that I’d be fine. Looks like his worries were not for nothing.<br/>
「God Heibos, do you… have a plan that I can use to defeat him?」<br/>
「It’s next to impossible to defeat Labrys in that labyrinth. Modes might be the only one who can defeat him, but I don’t think it’s a good idea to let him use that power of destruction.」<br/>
Heibos said with a vexed tone.<br/>
A long time ago, Modes entered the labyrinth in order to save Heibos. Even then, Modes couldn’t defeat Labrys until he went all out. Modes himself wasn’t aware of the full extent of his power. Heibos had no other option than to stop the dwarves from exacting a revenge against Labrys, all due to Modes’ overwhelming power. Heibos was the one who wanted to avenge the fallen dwarves the most, since they were his beloved children. But he was unable to do so, and thus, their deaths became a painful subject for Heibos.<br/>
「That’s why, I think your best option would be to save Nut without confronting Labrys.」<br/>
「Is there a way to achieve that? 」<br/>
「Nut’s on the 5th floor of the labyrinth. That place was originally an underground garden, but looks like Labrys turned it into a prison for his human captives. The other humans he imprisoned must be there too.」<br/>
According to Heibos, Labrys’ subordinates, the minotaurs were capturing humans and turning them into slaves.<br/>
「 Do you know the safest way to rescue them from that floor? 」<br/>
「 I don’t know… That floor was not a prison to begin with. I don’t know what it looks like now, since Labrys changed it.」<br/>
「I see…」<br/>
「 But one thing is for sure, the prison must be filled with loopholes, since it wasn’t meant to be one in the first place. There must be a hidden path somewhere, make use of that.」<br/>
「Well, I guess I’ll have to start by looking for that hidden path.」<br/>
.<br/>
「 Aside from that Unlike Rena’s hero and his women, Nut won’t be executed. Wouldn’t it be better for you to save Nut after Labrys executes them?」<br/>
He’s right. Labrys won’t go as far as to execute Nut. I doubt he even cares about Nut’s presence. It really would be better to save Nut after the Hero is executed or released.<br/>
「 Yes, you’re right. Thank you so much for teaching me about the labyrinth, God Heibos. I guess it’s time for to me leave.」<br/>
「Be careful, Dark Knight.」<br/>
Heibos waved his hand as he sent me off.<br/>
I bowed to Heibos once again and turned around to leave. While I was leaving, I saw a huge pile of materials on the right side of the door. Every dwarfman’s workshop usually had such materials left out like this.<br/>
「Will you come out of your hiding place now?」<br/>
I called out to the person hiding behind the pile of materials. I noticed that someone had eavesdropped on my conversation with Heibos. A figure revealed itself as the person came out of hiding, however, their face was covered with a hood.<br/>
「As expected of you, Kuroki. Is this the power of love?」<br/>
The person removed their hood, revealing an extremely beautiful face.<br/>
「You jest…. So it was you, huh, Goddess Rena.」<br/>
For some reason, I easily recognize her presence whenever Rena’s around. This was my third time meeting her. The first time was back in her temple in Holy Republic Lenaria. The second time was in Rox kingdom.<br/>
But, something about her was different this time. The way she was looking at me was even more coquettish than before and her body was covered with thicker clothes than before.<br/>
「 How did you know I’d be here, Rena? 」<br/>
I was extremely curious about it. Judging the way she eavesdropped on the conversation, she obviously knew that I’d visit Heibos’ abode beforehand. It’s not like she was already waiting in this place. I wonder how she managed to monitor my movement.<br/>
「Well, how do you think I did it?」<br/>
Rena smiled flirtatiously as she threw the question right back at me. Good grief, what on earth was this cunning goddess plotting now? I really couldn’t let my guard around her.<br/>
「 Hey Kuroki. You’re going to go into that labyrinth, right? Can I come along with you?」<br/>
She walked closer to me as she asked me that.<br/>
「I’m not going there to save Reiji.」<br/>
I averted my eyes as I replied coldly.<br/>
There was rumour going around the entire world that Rena and Reiji were going out. But she’d never struck me as the kind of woman who’d fall in love with Reiji. However, now that I’ve seen how desperately she wants to save Reiji, I’m convinced that the rumour was true. As expected, Nut’s information can never be wrong.<br/>
Honestly, I’m extremely jealous of Reiji. I mean, he has such a beautiful goddess as his lover while at the same time, he’s being waited upon by other beauties like Shirone. I want to flirt with beauties too! I’m so jealous that I can shed tears of blood!<br/>
Or at least, that used to be the case but I already have Kuna. However, it’s not like I can erase my envy towards his luck with women that easily.<br/>
That’s probably why I don’t want to save him. To think I was this petty…<br/>
Well, it’s not like he needs my help either. His party is extremely powerful. The girls in his party, and Reiji himself, are strong. Anyway, since Reiji has Shirone and the other beautiful girls by his side, I don’t think I need to save him. Shirone told me not to worry about her since she was with Reiji. So if I did help, I’d end up being a meddlesome third party. I should just do things in my own way.<br/>
「 Fufu, I’m not worried about Reiji, you see. I simply wish to be with you.」<br/>
Rena shortened the space between us, her face close to mine, as she gave me a charming smile.<br/>
WOAH! ! TOO CLOSE! ! TOO CLOSE! !<br/>
Although I was wearing my armor, my helmet was on my side, safely tucked away under my arm. So, my face was completely exposed.<br/>
That’s why I was startled when Rena’s beautiful face suddenly came up so close, just an inch away from mine. Is this one of her tricks to get me to help Reiji? She has no other reason to want to be with me.<br/>
「It’s so unfair! Why do you only stay with that girl? You should be with me if that girl isn’t by your side. It was extremely hard for me to slip out of Elios, you know? I didn’t even know when I’d get to meet you next if I missed this opportunity!」<br/>
Rena suddenly wrapped her arms around mine.<br/>
「WOAH! ? R-Rena! ! ? ?」<br/>
I was extremely troubled by this move of hers, in various ways.<br/>
By ‘that girl’, does she mean Kuna? Since Kuna was still recovering, she was in my mansion in Nargol. It took everything I could do to finally get her to rest like a good child. She kept insisting on coming along when I told I’d be visiting Heibos to seek advice on the best way to save Nut.<br/>
But, how did Rena get to know about my plans?<br/>
「Let’s go, Kuroki! If we use the dimension gate set up by Chiyuki, we can arrive immediately. We can begin the rescue operation right away!」<br/>
Rena pulled my arm, forcing me to follow her.<br/>
I haven’t even agreed with you though…<br/>
However, for some reason, I couldn’t bear to go against her.<br/>
