 <br/>
◇Mito's POV◇<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
"Nothing to do at all~"<br/>
<br/>
Sitting down on top of a water tower in the downtown, I look down below.<br/>
Ichirou-nii picked me up this morning, so I've been watching over the orphanage where Shin-kun is, but there's really nothing happening.<br/>
<br/>
The green demon that came to the Royal Capital last night didn't get in touch with Shin-kun either, so I'm thinking that this child might not be related to the recent series of events.<br/>
<br/>
--Oops, found a contact!<br/>
<br/>
Some evil-looking men approach Shin-kun and the children of the orphanages who have come to a well to draw water.<br/>
<br/>
I can't hear them.... I'll try using [Hearing Boost] magic.<br/>
<br/>
"--Transport these."<br/>
"And the reward?"<br/>
"I'll give you a meal once you've finished transporting it. That's fine with you right?"<br/>
"I want something that can be brought back to the orphanage."<br/>
<br/>
Arara, isn't he a good child. No wonder Ichirou-nii would meddle.<br/>
<br/>
It seems they're reached an agreement, Shin-kun leaves the children to draw water and then follows the men.<br/>
I put on the body-hiding mantle, and chase after them by jumping on the roofs.<br/>
<br/>
"I should just transport this right?"<br/>
"Yeah, bring it to the warehouse pass the cemetery. You've gone there before, so you know right?"<br/>
<br/>
Shin-kun and several children of the same age are pulling a cart.<br/>
The men who gave them the job are from a gray firm called [Stolen Goods Fox]. As the name suggest, they're probably dealing with stolen goods.<br/>
<br/>
Without being called out by the guards, Shin-kun and the others transported the cart to the cemetery just before the destination.<br/>
And there, three men in violet priest clothes are blocking their way.<br/>
<br/>
There is no priest clothes in violet color.<br/>
But there were people like them when I was working as a king.<br/>
<br/>
--Demon god believers, [Complete Equality].<br/>
<br/>
I checked them with Appraisal skill, but they're not those guys.<br/>
Looks like they're a part of a carefree occult club called [Wind of Liberty] that I've heard from Ichirou-nii before.<br/>
<br/>
But, there's something strange. The priests' states are strange. When I check further, they're in the state of [Suggestion].<br/>
<br/>
"Whaat? Oy, priests? You're in the way, can you get out of the road?"<br/>
<br/>
One of the boys who are transporting the goods threatened the three priests.<br/>
<br/>
"Gang of thieves. Know that there is an item that we need to offer to his majesty inside that cart."<br/>
"Leave it here and go away."<br/>
"If you do, we will not take your lives."<br/>
<br/>
The three announce that indifferently, the boys are drawing their swords, enraged.<br/>
<br/>
"Don't joke around! We'll be held responsible if we abandon the cart. Come if you don't value your life!"<br/>
"Very well."<br/>
<br/>
Sneering at that childish threat, the priests pull out rapiers.<br/>
<br/>
Fu~mu, it'll be problematic if Shin-kun is hurt, I'll try asking what those guys want.<br/>
I jump out of the grove, and land before the men.<br/>
<br/>
I ward off the swinging rapier with a broom, and block the thrusting rapier with a small shield of [Auto Defense].<br/>
<br/>
"Who are you!"<br/>
"Hi~ I'm a passing beau~ty"<br/>
<br/>
The men are grimacing to my smile, and the boys look weary.<br/>
These are some very rude guys. I'd like to let them drink some dirt from Ichirou-nii's fingernail. <TLN: Japanese proverb, same meaning as 'take a leaf out of someone's book'.><br/>
<br/>
"That move--woman! You must be Ryouna the 『Mower』 of Shiga Eight Swords!"<br/>
"To think that they'd smell out our plan this fast!"<br/>
"We can't hesitate anymore."<br/>
<br/>
The priests jump back and put down their rapiers.<br/>
<br/>
"Will you surrender?"<br/>
<br/>
They ignored me even though I kindly suggested it.<br/>
The three priests took something red from their chests, put it on their foreheads, and then say something simultaneously.<br/>
<br/>
"""O Short Horn, feed upon our desire to grant us violent power"""<br/>
<br/>
Together with the priests' shouts, something break through their priests' clothes, and then they change into gorilla-like lesser demons.<br/>
<br/>
"You guys, escape!"<br/>
<br/>
As I order them, the boys try to run away while desperately pulling the cart.<br/>
<br/>
"Just dump the luggage!"<br/>
<br/>
--ＧＲＲＯＵＷＷＷＮ.<br/>
<br/>
As if interrupting my warning, the gorillas wreck the surrounding with storm magic.<br/>
The cart is overturned, and the boys fall to the tombstones.<br/>
<br/>
Good, Shin boy is alright.<br/>
The other children are getting up and running away in groups of two and three.<br/>
<br/>
I pour magic power into the holy sword taken out from Inventory and recite the holy verse.<br/>
<br/>
"<<DANCE>> Claiomh Solais, become 13 blades, dancing in the sky."<br/>
<br/>
The holy swords turns the lower demons into black dust one after another.<br/>
<br/>
I look around to find the wire puller who manipulated them while seeing the reliable holy swords on the corner of my vision.<br/>
<br/>
--There.<br/>
<br/>
A short beastfolk disappears into the thicket that surround the cemetery.<br/>
<br/>
I'm worried about Shin boy and the luggage, but I'll chase that guy first.<br/>
I should've contracted a new familiar after waking up in the ruin.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
◇Shin's POV◇<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
What is this?<br/>
<br/>
What?<br/>
<br/>
What is this!<br/>
<br/>
Just when some priests blocked my work transporting a cart, a strange aunty cut in, and in the end the people turned into monsters. <br/>
<br/>
Isn't that strange?<br/>
<br/>
It's too strange!<br/>
<br/>
"Oy! Let's run! Stop dawdling!"<br/>
<br/>
Jeje the Lizardfolk who's usually taciturn urges everyone.<br/>
I hurriedly begin to push back the cart.<br/>
<br/>
"Just throw the luggage!"<br/>
<br/>
The aunty shouted from behind, but we can't do that.<br/>
This portage work is a job from a crime guild.<br/>
<br/>
If we break or steal the luggage, we'll be treated harsher than turning into slaves.<br/>
<br/>
--ＧＲＲＯＵＷＷＷＮ.<br/>
<br/>
Storm raged from behind, we're blown away together with the cart.<br/>
<br/>
"D-demons!"<br/>
"Run!"<br/>
<br/>
Everyone scrambles away.<br/>
I also desperately crawl below the overturned cart.<br/>
<br/>
When I push some obstructing boxes, a statue of goddess falls out from the inside.<br/>
For some reason I can't get my eyes off it even though it's at a time like this.<br/>
<br/>
The second storm rages on when my hand reaches out to that goddess statue.<br/>
I roll on the ground while holding the goddess statue.<br/>
<br/>
I saw blue light swords pulled by the aunty turning the lesser demons into black dust.<br/>
The aunty shouts, "Wait!", and then she jumps out to the other side of the cemetery.<br/>
<br/>
--Am I saved?<br/>
<br/>
I feel something odd in my hand while feeling relieved.<br/>
The goddess statue has crumbled into sand.<br/>
<br/>
A violet orb appeared from the inside.<br/>
<br/>
I scoop the orb that's emitting ominous light from the interior, and hold it over the sunlight.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
◇Arisa's POV◇<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
--This is bad.<br/>
<br/>
"I wonder how will Sir Pendragon interpret this formula."<br/>
<br/>
Like so.<br/>
<br/>
"This cake was made by Sir Pendragon right. He's really versatile isn't he."<br/>
<br/>
Or so, Princess Shistina's reaction is bad.<br/>
Looking at her reaction and the flow, she's too much like a girl in love.<br/>
<br/>
Thanks to that, the matter of [Nectar] or Hisui weren't talked about much, so we were saved though.<br/>
Geez, she's just too easy.<br/>
<br/>
Perhaps our Master has the qualification as a first-rate flag architect?<br/>
<br/>
That Master of ours had just contacted me with [Short Message] magic, telling that he had obtained the [Chant Orb] safely.<br/>
He probably mailed cause I wouldn't pick up [Telephone].<br/>
<br/>
The writing style is so merry you wouldn't have thought it was the usual Master.<br/>
It's too frustrating that I can't preserve it.<br/>
<br/>
At the end of that message, he wrote that in order to master the chant and to register magic into the magic column, he would go to, "A place where I wouldn't worry about human damage."<br/>
He's probably experimenting in the vast desert to the west of Labyrinth City Selbira.<br/>
My tension is rising just by imagining the spectacle.<br/>
<br/>
Maybe I should cut the tea party short and go visit it with Mia.<br/>
<br/>
Mia who looks like she'll vomit sugar seeing Shistina chattering fondly of Master, mutters, "Mwu?"<br/>
I can hear pitter-patter footsteps from the direction where she's looking at.<br/>
<br/>
"Onee-sama!"<br/>
<br/>
Loli princess Doris who jumped into the room hugs Shistina.<br/>
The attendants of Doris who are running after her from behind apologize for the rudeness in panic.<br/>
<br/>
It seems courtesy is required if you're sister princesses of a large kingdom.<br/>
<br/>
"That Hisui you see, even though she had gone back to her cage and ate her meal before I knew it yesterday, she's gone again just now!"<br/>
"How mysterious--"<br/>
<br/>
The bird has drank Nectar after all, I wonder if she's gained some strange ability or something?<br/>
<br/>
I have to report to Master and ask if we need to do something about it.<br/>
If possible, in the bed while we're huddling our faces together--guhehehe.<br/>
<br/>
My delightful delusion is interrupted by pirupiru chirps.<br/>
<br/>
"Hisuiiiii!"<br/>
<br/>
Hisui who's appeared in the room before anyone knew pulls Doris's hair and dress, trying to take her somewhere.<br/>
<br/>
"No! Stop it, Hisui!"<br/>
<br/>
However, it seems Princess Doris doesn't understand it.<br/>
This time, she's flying around Shistina, doing her best to take her outside.<br/>
<br/>
I'm bothered with Hisui's curious desperation.<br/>
Did she get an ability to detect disaster after drinking the Nectar?<br/>
<br/>
"Nn, piruru, piru, piru."<br/>
<br/>
When Mia mimicked Hisui's cry, Hisui chirped back, "pipirupirupiru" too.<br/>
<br/>
"As expected of elf-sama, she understands bird's language!"<br/>
<br/>
One of the maids speaks with admiration.<br/>
Mia continues to pirupiru with a composed face, but she's just playing around by mimicking the chirping.<br/>
If this were a manga, there would sweat marks on Mia's face, no doubt.<br/>
<br/>
While also helping Mia, I'll go check the royal capital from the top of the big sakura tree.<br/>
<br/>
"I'll be going to the washroom for a bit."<br/>
<br/>
After telling so, I take Mia along into a private luxurious toilet.<br/>
<br/>
"Master hasn't contacted us with anything so I think it's fine, but let's check out outside for a bit."<br/>
"Nn."<br/>
<br/>
I can't teleport to a precise location without a carved seal board, so I teleport to the sky above the big sakura tree.<br/>
The sunlight is darkened even though it should be clear today.<br/>
<br/>
"Arisa, above."<br/>
"Ugeh, the heck is thaaaaaat!"<br/>
<br/>
After teleporting to the top of the big sakura tree and sitting down, I looked above urged by Mia, and screamed to the abnormal scene before my eyes.<br/>
<br/>
"A rock?"<br/>
<br/>
I see a huge rock trying to come out of a crack in the sky on top of the royal castle.<br/>
<br/>
It's as big as the whole royal castle.<br/>
If that falls, there will be a lot of victims from the castle.<br/>
<br/>
I immediately invoke [World Phone], but I can't connect to Master.<br/>
It's not blocked, the reaction feels like when Telephone magic can't reach a target that's too far away.<br/>
<br/>
"Arisa."<br/>
<br/>
--It can't be helped, let's decide quickly.<br/>
<br/>
"Over Boost"<br/>
<br/>
Violet glow is wrapping me.<br/>
I take the coolest looking pose, and then shout out the magic name with fighting spirit.<br/>
<br/>
"『Gate』 open!"<br/>
<br/>
Riding on my spirit, the effect of Unique Skill is raised.<br/>
<br/>
A teleport gate at the size that can swallow a private house is opened in the sky.<br/>
But it's too small to redirect that rock.<br/>
<br/>
"Magic potion."<br/>
<br/>
With fighting spirit, I gulp down the magic potion that Mia gives me.<br/>
It' super sweet. It's sweet enough my teeth feel like melting, but power is gushing forth.<br/>
<br/>
Master's love recovers my magic power in a flash.<br/>
<br/>
"Over Boost aaaand, 『Gate』 opeen!"<br/>
<br/>
By overlapping the magic, the teleport gate widens.<br/>
Violet light coils the dimension rift, widening the teleport gate.<br/>
<br/>
But, it's still a bit short.<br/>
<br/>
The royal castle should be saved with just this much, but enormous damage will appear on the castle's surrounding.<br/>
The parking lot where Zena-tan and her friends are standing by and the guest house where Karina is should be in danger.<br/>
<br/>
"Blood."<br/>
<br/>
The capillary on my fingers have torn and blood are spurting out of it, maybe because I was repeatedly being forceful.<br/>
I'll say thanks later to Mia who wraps them with a handkerchief.<br/>
<br/>
I drink the second magic potion, and use the Unique Skill for the third time today.<br/>
<br/>
Over Boost.<br/>
<br/>
The depth of my soul is screaming like creaking sounds.<br/>
A pain that's about three time more painful than wisdom teeth attacks my body.<br/>
<br/>
I think Master warned me about it back then.<br/>
If you over-use Unique Skill, the vessel of your soul would break, and you'd fall into a demon lord.<br/>
<br/>
--But, if I run away here, it'll be a disgrace as a woman!<br/>
<br/>
I'll lose if I don't push myself here!<br/>
<br/>
"Gooooooooooo!"<br/>
<br/>
I put all of my magic power, and then the [Gate] widens even though it's destabilizing.<br/>
I can't control the teleport gate with my ability.<br/>
<br/>
『Dryad! Lend us your power! The requester is Misanalia! A spirit user of Boruenan Forest possessing Spirit Eyes!』<br/>
『Okay~, the sakura tree will disappear if I don't help here.』<br/>
<br/>
Mia shouted something in elf language, and then a pink-colored dryad appeared from the big sakura tree.<br/>
<br/>
『Young lady, I'll connect your wand with the sakura tree to be an assist, do your best after that.』<br/>
<br/>
I don't understand her words, but the control suddenly feels easier.<br/>
The [Gate] that was about to dissolve any moment became like a calm water surface.<br/>
<br/>
And then, the huge rock finally falls from the sky.<br/>
<br/>
No! The position is a bit bad.<br/>
<br/>
--Funnu.<br/>
<br/>
I fire myself up and shift the [Gate] to the site where the huge rock falls.<br/>
It seems my forehead's blood vessels have erupted, my view is dyed red.<br/>
<br/>
However, it was worth overdoing!<br/>
<br/>
The huge rock falls out of the [Gate] to the outskirt plain. Whenever the huge rock hits the ground, around magnitude 3 earthquake shakes the royal capital.<br/>
The huge rock falls just like that, splitting the mountain nearby, and then stops.<br/>
<br/>
"Huu, this is thanks to Hisui. Putting us aside, if that child didn't inform us, the people of the royal castle wouldn't be saved."<br/>
"Arisa."<br/>
<br/>
While drinking the magic potion that Mia gave me, I shift my gaze to the emergency alarm magic tool that's been ringing since awhile ago.<br/>
This is a tool to notify us when something is happening with our group.<br/>
<br/>
The lamp indicating Liza is shining.<br/>
<br/>
