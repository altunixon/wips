<br/>
"Takki-dono, this is the 7th District. The district of demi-humans-desu zo." (Fuji)<br/>
"Hoh…the back of the Highland Castle is the 7th district, huh." (Makoto)<br/>
The cityscape is pretty different from the 6th district that is maintained. <br/>
My first impression is that it is a mess.<br/>
The ground is not paved, but naked earth.<br/>
There’s a lot of people, and it is a bit dusty.<br/>
There’s plenty of people talking and it is noisy.<br/>
Humans, beastkin, elves, dwarves, lizardkin, and many other races.<br/>
There’s a lot of human merchants.<br/>
In many places there’s wooden stalls and a whole lot of products.<br/>
"Takatsuki-sama~, care not to get lost." (Nina)<br/>
"Nina-san, I am not a child." (Makoto)<br/>
Today I am with Fuji-yan and Nina-san.<br/>
When a human that’s not a merchant wanders around the 7th and 8th District, they apparently get caught up in trouble.<br/>
The districts of demi-humans. Is the public order bad?<br/>
"Can I have 3 of this?" (Fuji)<br/>
Fuji-yan is buying sandwiches made with vegetable and bird meat from a stall.<br/>
"Here you go, Nina-dono, Takki-dono." (Fuji)<br/>
"Thank you very much, Danna-sama." (Nina) <br/>
"Thanks, Fuji-yan." (Makoto)<br/>
The bread is similar to french bread and it is hard. <br/>
I munch on it as we walk.<br/>
The meat juices seeped into the bread and it mixed with the thick sauce, it was delicious.<br/>
"Do you come to the 7th District often, Fuji-yan." (Makoto)<br/>
"The price of the commodities is cheaper compared to the 6th District-desu zo. Also, there’s things you can dig out from here." (Fuji)<br/>
"There’s a lot of thieves after all. There’s no worries for Danna-sama though." (Nina)<br/>
"The best is to stock in the 7th District and sell them in the noble’s 3rd District." (Fuji) <br/>
Fuji-yan laughs and Nina-san chuckles.<br/>
Hoh, so prices are different in the human areas to the demi-human areas.<br/>
It is cheaper to stock, and sells at a high price; a basic of marketing.<br/>
If it is Fuji-yan with his Superior Appraisal Skill, digging up stuff is right up his alley.<br/>
I once again look around.<br/>
This looks similar to the marketplace of south-east Asia.<br/>
The atmosphere is nice.<br/>
"By the way, Sofia-sama told me that tonight there will be a ‘Celebration party for the coming of a new Hero of Rozes’ in the Highland Castle. The organizer is Princess Noel." (Fuji)<br/>
"I see…" (Makoto)<br/>
New Hero? Ah, me.<br/>
"But this is the Sun Country though." (Makoto)<br/>
I would understand if it was a celebration in Rozes.<br/>
"Takatsuki-sama, the coming of a new Hero is announced every generation as a bright topic to liven up the people. It is normal." (Nina)<br/>
Nina-san explains.<br/>
I see.<br/>
Heroes are tools for politics.<br/>
"But Highland is fussy in the decorum compared to Rozes, so be careful…" (Nina)<br/>
Nina-san looks at me with worry.<br/>
"He did end up picking a fight with one of the Five Sacred Nobles right after arriving in Symphonia after all." (Fuji)<br/>
Fuji-yan chuckles.<br/>
Uh, yeah. I am not the quick temper type though…<br/>
This isn’t good. My image lately has been bad?<br/>
"Where are we going now?" (Makoto)<br/>
Let’s change the topic.<br/>
"There’s a person here that took care of me in the past, you see. I am going there to have a business discussion as well as tell them about my marriage." (Nina)<br/>
Nina-san laughs with a ‘nufufu’.<br/>
Looking at her happy face makes me feel warm and fluffy.<br/>
"Well then, let’s go." (Fuji)<br/>
We head to our objective guided by Fuji-yan.<br/>
-Lucy POV-<br/>
Makoto went out with Fujiyan-san and Nina-san. <br/>
He left while saying: ‘When coming to a new city, the first thing to do is explore! That’s just common sense!’.<br/>
He really is full of energy.<br/>
Even though he fought the Lightning Hero Geralt just yesterday.<br/>
Is his body okay?<br/>
"Aya, was it okay to not go with Makoto?" (Lucy)<br/>
"Takatsuki-kun and Fujiwara-kun said that they will be checking out weapon and equipment stores. I thought that would be boring. What about you, Lucy-san?" (Aya)<br/>
"I…have asked the Great Sage-sama to train me." (Lucy)<br/>
"Ooh! That sounds like fun. Can I go?" (Aya)<br/>
"Eeh? …I don’t mind though." (Lucy)<br/>
I have already told Aya that the Great Sage-sama is a vampire and is the legendary person of 1,000 years ago.<br/>
The fact that Makoto’s blood was sucked as well.<br/>
She is a party member of Makoto, so there shouldn’t be any problems.<br/>
But isn’t she scared of meeting her?<br/>
Makoto said he wouldn’t meet the Great Sage-sama for a while.<br/>
"But before that, I would like to explore a bit~. Wanna come?" (Aya)<br/>
Looks like Aya wants to go shopping.<br/>
She resembles Makoto in the part that she likes exploring.<br/>
"Okay, I will." (Lucy)<br/>
This is my first time in the capital of Highland.<br/>
An elf walking around the area of humans stands out, so it helps out that Aya is with me.<br/>
We both went into the city.<br/>
◇◇<br/>
 "T-That’s expensive…" (Lucy)<br/>
"Yeah…the design of the clothes here are cute though." (Aya)<br/>
Aya and I look at each other.<br/>
The prices in Symphonia are high.<br/>
The Horun capital was expensive compared to Makkaren, but this one here is even higher than that.<br/>
By the way, I am hiding my ears by wearing a hat.<br/>
Elves can pass as humans as long as you hide your ears.<br/>
"How about we go eat something?" (Lucy)<br/>
I am getting a bit hungry.<br/>
"Is it okay to not go to the Great Sage-sama, Lucy-san?" (Aya)<br/>
"It is still noon. The Great Sage-sama sleeps in the day, so she said she prefers for it to be at a late hour." (Lucy)<br/>
"I see… But Fujiwara-kun said that there’s a party tonight in the Highland Castle." (Aya)<br/>
A banquet to celebrate the new Hero, Makoto.<br/>
But they are fussy about etiquette, and it is a social event in Highland which is human supremacist.<br/>
An elf like me…<br/>
"Maybe I shouldn’t participate…" (Lucy)<br/>
"Eh?! Nina-san also said she wasn’t gonna go! Me going there on my own would make me uneasy~." (Aya)<br/>
Aya pulled my sleeve.<br/>
"Chris-san and Princess Sofia will be there." (Lucy)<br/>
"No, I am not that close to those two…" (Aya)<br/>
Well, me neither.<br/>
While we were having that conversation…<br/>
"The two over there. You have quite the peculiar destinies." <br/>
We were suddenly called.<br/>
The owner of the voice had a purple hood and robe, so I couldn’t see her face, but I can tell from her voice that it is a woman.<br/>
She had a big crystal ball on top of a small table.<br/>
…A fortune-teller?<br/>
She is giving out a somewhat suspicious air.<br/>
"Talking to us?" (Aya)<br/>
Aya reacted.<br/>
"Wait, Aya, let’s not." (Lucy)<br/>
Fortune telling is popular within a certain group of human females.<br/>
But there’s apparently scammers within the fortune tellers that are good with their words and demand an exorbitant amount of coin.<br/>
In the first place, users of the future reading ‘Destiny Magic’ are incredibly rare.<br/>
Meeting a mage like that at the corner of a street like this…she is most likely a fake weak mage.<br/>
"So there’s fortune tellers in this world as well." (Aya)<br/>
Aya was looking interested.<br/>
"Oh my, you came from a parallel world, didn’t you? You have quite the mysterious fate."<br/>
"You can tell?" (Aya)<br/>
Aya skips her way to her.<br/>
Aah, she was pulled.<br/>
It can’t be helped, so I head to the place of the fortune teller too.<br/>
"What do you want to know?" <br/>
The fortune teller smiles softly.<br/>
I can’t see her whole face due to the shadow of the robe, but maybe she is quite the beauty?<br/>
"Hmm, but, are your fortunes truly accurate?" (Aya)<br/>
Aya smiles.<br/>
"Oh my, that’s upsetting. I hold pride in being the number one best fortune teller in this capital, you know?" <br/>
The fortune teller-san giggles boldly. <br/>
"Then, try telling me something about me. If you do, maybe I will get my fortune told~." (Aya)<br/>
Ooh, you are good, Aya.<br/>
If she doesn’t hit at all, then we wouldn’t be losing anything.<br/>
There’s scammers who would use the Appraisal Skill to make it look like they know about you.<br/>
In reality, the Appraisal Skill can only get surface level information. <br/>
It of course can’t read the future or the heart of people.<br/>
In that area, there’s Destiny Magic and the legendary Mindread Skill.<br/>
"Fufu, then, let’s look…" <br/>
The fortune teller peeks at her crystal ball.<br/>
(Hey hey, Lucy-san, is fortune telling magic?) (Aya)<br/>
Aya asks me in a whisper.<br/>
(Yeah, it is metal element Fortune Magic. But this might be the first time I see an user of it.) (Lucy)<br/>
If she really is a Destiny Magic user, she is a rare existence.<br/>
I have heard that royals would employ fortune tellers on a high salary.<br/>
"Oh my oh my, an interesting result showed up." <br/>
The fortune teller raises her head.<br/>
The moment I got a peek at her eye, my heart jumped.<br/>
"You…have love troubles, don’t you?" <br/>
"…Well, yeah." (Aya)<br/>
Aya answers the question of the fortune teller.<br/>
But that’s a common issue with girls her age.<br/>
Anyone can say that.<br/>
When I looked at Aya, she looked disappointed.<br/>
I knew this would happen.<br/>
"Fufu, that worry of yours…is about your friend loving the same person as you. Did I get that right?"<br/>
"?! I-It might be." (Aya)<br/>
That’s…<br/>
Is this person a real Destiny Magic user?<br/>
"And, about that friend…" <br/>
The fortune teller’s mouth warps into a teasing smile.<br/>
"Is that elf girl at your side, maybe?" <br/>
""?!""<br/>
It shook us.<br/>
T-This fortune teller!<br/>
What a thing to say!<br/>
She hit the mark, she hit the mark but…!<br/>
"H-Hooh…that’s impressive, Onee-san." (Aya)<br/>
Aya’s…eyes have gotten serious.<br/>
"Did I get it right? Then, the fortune telling price is 5,000G, advance payment." <br/>
"You are asking for quite a lot." (Lucy)<br/>
"But this person is incredible, Lucy-san." (Aya)<br/>
Aya takes out money from her wallet and gives it to the fortune teller.<br/>
"Then, I will tell you your fortune. Want me to tell you about whether you will get together with that loved person of yours?" <br/>
(Wait! My heart is not ready! Don’t!) (Lucy)<br/>
Is what I thought, but the words of Aya were of something completely different.<br/>
"…The location of my sister that betrayed my family." (Aya)<br/>
"……"<br/>
I see.<br/>
Aya lost her family in Laberintos.<br/>
She defeated one of her targets, the Harpy Queen, but the other one, Aya’s sister, is missing.<br/>
"Looks like you have your circumstances. Wait for a bit." <br/>
The fortune teller once again peeks into her crystal ball.<br/>
The crystal ball releases a dim light of several colors.<br/>
"…Got it. Your sister is in the north continent, the demon continent… I don’t know why she is there though." <br/>
"I see… So she really is alive." (Aya)<br/>
Aya clenches her fist tightly.<br/>
"With her being in a different continent, getting more detailed information than this will prove difficult." <br/>
The fortune teller says apologetically.<br/>
"It is okay, thanks. I am fine with just knowing that she is alive." (Aya)<br/>
"Okay. I am saying this because I feel strong hatred in your mana right now but…vengeance is like a curse, you know?" <br/>
She rests her chin in one hand and speaks.<br/>
"Are you telling me to stop?" (Aya)<br/>
Aya’s words were firm.<br/>
Aya has no intention of forgiving her sister who was the reason for losing her family.<br/>
"I am just saying you should keep it in moderation. By the way, if you pay me, I can also tell you if you will get together with your loved one, you know." <br/>
"Eh?" (Lucy)<br/>
I was the one who let out that voice.<br/>
That would be troubling!<br/>
The fortune telling of this person feels like it has quite the accuracy! <br/>
"I would rather not. The person I love really hates spoilery stuff." (Aya)<br/>
Aya responds while loosening her expression.<br/>
T-That’s a relief…<br/>
So that’s how Makoto is.<br/>
"What about you, red haired girl?" <br/>
"I-I’m also okay!" (Lucy)<br/>
I am interested! I am incredibly interested though! <br/>
At that moment, a voice suddenly rang from our back.<br/>
"Oi, the fortune teller there. Do you have permission to have business there?" <br/>
The one who came was a knight in white armor.<br/>
The crest engraved in his armor is that of a maiden offering a prayer, the Holy Maiden Anna.<br/>
Meaning that he is a Templar?<br/>
If I remember correctly, it is the knights that are protecting Symphonia.<br/>
"Aah, a troublesome one has come. I guess I will be closing store for today." <br/>
The fortune teller stands up and begins to pack her crystal ball.<br/>
"You heathen, you were doing business without a permit, weren’t you?! I will have you come with me." <br/>
The knight tries to get close to the fortune teller with long strides, but…<br/>
"Templar-san, it is okay. I got the permission just now." <br/>
Saying this, she lightly touches the armor of the knight.<br/>
"…Aah, yeah. You are right. There’s no problem." <br/>
That knight’s tone lightened, and his expression seemed spaced-out now.<br/>
He fumbled his way back to where he came.<br/>
"That just now…" (Lucy)<br/>
"Hey, Lucy-san! The fortune teller-san of just now…!" (Aya)<br/>
When I turned back, the fortune teller was gone.<br/>
"What a strange person." (Aya)<br/>
"Aya…it is better for you to suspect people more." (Lucy)<br/>
"Hmm, but she told me where my sister is." (Aya)<br/>
Aya seems to be satisfied.<br/>
It is true that her skills seemed to be the real deal though.<br/>
The feelings of people can’t be read with an Appraisal Skill.<br/>
…The feelings of people.<br/>
"By the way, that talk about the person you like, Aya…" (Lucy)<br/>
I try to confirm what was bothering me.<br/>
She clearly stated that we like the same person.<br/>
"Well, it was pretty obvious between the both of us." (Aya)<br/>
"R-Right." (Lucy)<br/>
Is she telling me not to worry?<br/>
I have been training all the time lately and have been trying to not think about it much. <br/>
Aya suddenly made a slightly complicated expression.<br/>
"Honestly speaking, I don’t think it is the time to be having troubles within the party, you know." (Aya)<br/>
"What do you mean by that?" (Lucy)<br/>
"The attitude of Princess Sofia towards Takatsuki-kun has been suspicious lately." (Aya)<br/>
"I get that! She may seem expressionless at a glance, but the eyes she has when looking at Makoto are kind!" (Lucy)<br/>
"My Intuition Skill is going ‘bibibibi!’, so there’s no doubt!" (Aya)<br/>
"I feel like her heartbeat gets faster when Makoto gets close!" (Lucy)<br/>
"…Lucy-san, you are doing stuff like that?" (Aya)<br/>
I am a half-elf after all.<br/>
I have confidence in my ears.<br/>
Aya, don’t look at me with those cooled eyes.<br/>
Aya and I had a lively talk about Makoto for a while, and then, ended up going late to the place of the Great Sage-sama and got scolded.<br/>
"Why didn’t you bring the Spirit User?!", she said.<br/>
Could it be that the Great Sage-sama also loves Makoto?<br/>
She is just aiming for his blood, right?<br/>
-Takatsuki Makoto POV-<br/>
The place we headed to wasn’t a street stall or a cart, but a splendid store.<br/>
"Hello, Occhan <Old man>! It has been a while!" (Nina)<br/>
Nina-san does a high-five with the shopkeeper.<br/>
The shopkeeper is a tiger beastkin with a scary face.<br/>
Has a big build, and his height might be close to 2 meters.<br/>
It is hard to tell his age, but there’s grey hair mixed, so I feel like he is decently aged.<br/>
"Ooh, you look well, Nina. It has been a while too, Fujiwara-san." <br/>
"It has been a while, Owner. Do you have any good merchandise today?" (Fuji)<br/>
"Yeah, I got a variety of things. There’s no deceiving your eyes, so the goods that we dug out today are gonna be gone though." <br/>
Both of them let out loud laughs.<br/>
Is that a merchant-style greeting?<br/>
"And the one over there?" <br/>
"This person here is the Hero of the Water Country, Takatsuki-sama." (Nina)<br/>
"…Hooh." <br/>
The shopkeeper opens his eyes wide at the words of Nina-san.<br/>
"He doesn’t look that strong though… Ah, sorry. I am the shopkeeper of this place, Teogir. I was an adventurer in the past, and I looked after Nina in those times." <br/>
"I am Takatsuki Makoto. Nina-san has adventured with me a number of times and has helped me out." (Makoto)<br/>
"What?! That Nina in a Hero party?! You have climbed high." <br/>
Teogir-san raises a voice of admiration, and Nina-san hurriedly corrects him.<br/>
"That’s not it, Occhan. I am going to become the wife of Fujiwara-sama! I came here to report this." (Nina)<br/>
"What did you say?!" (Teogir)<br/>
Teogir-san’s face changes.<br/>
"Fujiwara-san, I heard that you were engaged to a noble of Makkaren. If you are going to make Nina your concubine, I don’t feel like giving you my blessings though…" (Teogir)<br/>
"Occhan, you are jumping to conclusions. I am the second wife, but I am treated on the same standing as the second daughter of the feudal lord of Makkaren, Christiana." (Nina)<br/>
"…What are you saying? There’s no way that’s possible." (Teogir)<br/>
Teogir-san directed eyes of doubt.<br/>
Looks like when you do business for long in Highland, a story about a beastkin and noble being treated equally is hard to believe.<br/>
The social hierarchy system in this country does seem to run deep…<br/>
"Can’t believe it… This noble called Christiana-sama sounds like quite the bold personage." (Teogir)<br/>
"She is now a good friend of mine." (Nina)<br/>
"…I see. That’s great." (Teogir)<br/>
Nina-san had a cheerful expression, and Teogir-san had a slightly complicated one.<br/>
Does it bother him that Nina-san is joining the nobles? <br/>
"By the way, how long will you guys be staying in the capital?" (Teogir)<br/>
"Sometime after the inauguration ceremony of the Sun Knight captain, I guess. At that time, there’s apparently going to be a commendation for Takki-dono’s Taboo Dragon subjugation." (Fuji)<br/>
Fuji-yan answers for us.<br/>
"…I see." (Teogir)<br/>
Teogir-san seemed like he wanted to say something, but swallowed it.<br/>
What is it?<br/>
The three of them were having a lively talk for a while, so I looked around the store. <br/>
As expected of a place Fuji-yan goes to, there’s a good variety of items.<br/>
There were a lot of products that I have never seen before lined up.<br/>
Suddenly, I caught a smell that bothered me.<br/>
I glanced at a tobacco that was at the corner of the counter.<br/>
That’s…<br/>
After that, Nina-san said that she would be coming again, and we left the store of Teogir-san.<br/>
Soon after leaving the store, Fuji-yan said: ‘Let’s leave the 7th District’.<br/>
"Danna-sama, weren’t we planning on going around a few more stores?" (Nina)<br/>
"If you have an urgent matter, I can walk around for a bit by myself." (Makoto)<br/>
If I use my Transformation Skill and transform into a beastkin, I feel like there won’t be problems.<br/>
"No, I have something important to tell you two. But saying it here is bad." (Fuji)<br/>
Telling us this with a serious face, Nina-san and I look at each other.<br/>
We eventually return to the 6th District. <br/>
We enter the private room of a restaurant closeby. <br/>
Fuji-yan lowered his voice and checked his surroundings first before saying:<br/>
"Nina-dono, Takki-dono, please listen calmly. It seems like the 7th and 8th District demi-humans are planning a big scale rebellion mainly focused in beastkin." (Fuji)<br/>
