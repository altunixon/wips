<br/>
"Good morning, did you wait, Makoto?" <br/>
"I got here just now." (Makoto)<br/>
"Then, let’s go." <br/>
After having an exchange like that of a couple, I head off with Lucy.<br/>
The rendezvous point was the guild entrance.<br/>
Anyways, no matter how many times I look at Lucy, she is still a beauty. <br/>
Being able to form a party with a beauty like this, Isekais aren’t that bad, huh.<br/>
But there’s one thing that bothers me.<br/>
"Aren’t you cold?" (Makoto)<br/>
It may be spring already, but the mornings are cold. <br/>
Even though I have a long sleeve shirt, and a coat on, Lucy was lightly dressed. <br/>
A shirt that looks like a camisole, and a short skirt. She is also wearing a cloak, but it is hard to call that protection against the cold.<br/>
"I have a naturally high body temperature, so don’t worry." (Lucy)<br/>
"I see." (Makoto)<br/>
Lucy says she has no problems with it, but as a healthy high school boy, with that attire, it is hard for me to know where to look.<br/>
Her fashion that shows her shoulders and thighs is so dazzling.<br/>
I set [Clear Mind] at 80%.<br/>
With this, I can cut off most earthly desires.<br/>
I act as if I don’t mind and change the topic.<br/>
I stand at the front of the guild’s notice board.<br/>
"Are there any good quests?" (Makoto)<br/>
"Hmm, nothing seems to click." (Lucy)<br/>
Giving a cursory glance, there’s Griffon Subjugation, Search and Subjugate the Labyrinth’s Minotauros, Deliver the scales of a Firedrake; those kind of high difficulty quests were lined up.<br/>
It would be impossible for us.<br/>
The other ones left are things like: Gather Medicinal Plants, Deliver Horn Rabbit Meat; the errand kind of quests.<br/>
"Ara, isn’t that Makoto and Lucy? In the middle of searching for your first quest as a party?" (Mary)<br/>
Mary-san seems to have begun working for the day just in time.<br/>
"Good morning, Mary-san. Are there any good quests?" (Makoto)<br/>
"Hmm, a party of 2 bronze rank mages, huh. That will be difficult." (Mary)<br/>
She was making a troubled expression.<br/>
Can’t be helped.<br/>
"Let’s hunt goblins. It is safe and we can earn some small change." (Makoto)<br/>
"It is your specialty after all." (Lucy)<br/>
"Mary-san, we will be going. Good luck with your work." (Makoto)<br/>
"Yes, be careful out there. I think you will be okay though, Makoto-kun." (Mary)<br/>
"And me?" (Lucy)<br/>
"You listen to what Makoto-kun says okay, Lucy? Don’t fight each other, got it?" (Mary)<br/>
"Eh? What’s with that?" (Lucy)<br/>
Lucy didn’t seem to like that.<br/>
In her previous party she fought with her party and separated from them.<br/>
Can’t be helped that Mary-san would worry about her.<br/>
We waved at Mary-san and left the guild.<br/>
◇◇<br/>
 "Hey, don’t you think Mary-san likes you, Makoto?" (Lucy)<br/>
"Eh?" (Makoto)<br/>
What’s that all of a sudden?<br/>
"There’s no way." (Makoto)<br/>
"But isn’t she awfully kind to just you?" (Lucy) <br/>
"That’s because I am a newcomer." (Makoto)<br/>
Also, she must be quite worried due to my poor stats and whatnot.<br/>
She was quite surprised the first time I showed her my Soul Book.<br/>
"She apparently stops looking after the other adventurers once they become bronze rank, you know? People are saying only you are being looked after this whole time." (Lucy)<br/>
"No no no." (Makoto)<br/>
I haven’t heard about that gossip though.<br/>
"Aren’t you overthinking it?" (Makoto)<br/>
"Everyday you go have dinner, she talks to you, right? Before you came to the guild, Mary-san would go drink around once every 2 days, you know." (Lucy) <br/>
"I-Is that so." (Makoto)<br/>
Mary-san likes me?<br/>
A beautiful Onee-san type of girl.<br/>
Her boobs are big.<br/>
I gulp.<br/>
Would she kindly lead me in bed too?<br/>
Wait, that’s not it! <br/>
I am getting impatient here since the time I heard about the story of Fuji-yan.<br/>
I am not the type of man that burns in desire.<br/>
"Stop talking nonsense and let’s go." (Makoto)<br/>
"Aah, changed the topic." (Lucy)<br/>
"That’s enough of it. Even against goblins, we have to take it seriously, or we will get hurt." (Makoto)<br/>
For now, let’s return the conversation to the quest.<br/>
"I get it, geez. Hey, where are we heading today?" (Lucy)<br/>
"Close to the Demonic Forest that I am always hunting goblins at." (Makoto)<br/>
"Eeh? Isn’t that far? It takes around half a day just going there, you know." (Lucy)<br/>
"It is okay, it is okay." (Makoto)<br/>
"Really?" (Lucy)<br/>
Lucy seems to be worried.<br/>
Well, you will understand once you see it yourself.<br/>
I greet the gatekeeper-san at the west gate and leave the city.<br/>
Once you leave the gate, you can see the forest immediately.<br/>
We walk through the main road of the forest for a while.<br/>
"Now that I think about it…" (Makoto)<br/>
I ask her about something that was bothering me.<br/>
"You are an elf, Lucy?" (Makoto)<br/>
My first party member is an elf.<br/>
I can brag about this to Fuji-yan!<br/>
"T-That’s right! You can tell by looking at my ears, right?!" (Lucy)<br/>
"Ooh, I see. So there’s elves with red hair and eyes’, when I say this, Lucy averted her gaze.<br/>
"Uhm, I am a mixed race. Not a pure blooded elf…" (Lucy)<br/>
"Hm?" (Makoto)<br/>
Aah, so this was a landmine, huh.<br/>
Maybe she has had it rough until now because she was mixed? Like getting isolated from the other elves.<br/>
If that’s the case, I have said something insensitive here…<br/>
"Well, my grandfather is the chief of the elf village, so I had the people that complained about me be ostracized though." (Lucy)<br/>
Lucy says this without a single shred of guilt and a triumphant face.<br/>
This girl is bold.<br/>
"Does it bother you that I am not a pure blood elf, Makoto?" (Lucy)<br/>
She looks at me anxious.<br/>
Oi oi, where did the boldness go?<br/>
"I just asked because you are the first elf I met after coming to this world." (Makoto)<br/>
"Aah, so that’s what it was." (Lucy)<br/>
Lucy looks relieved.<br/>
Conversing in a party is difficult. I don’t know how far I can step in.<br/>
The difficulty is high for an antisocial person like me.<br/>
We walk in the forest for a while, and we head to the brook that’s at the side of the road.<br/>
Around here should be fine.<br/>
"Hey, where are we going? There’s a stream that way, you know." (Lucy)<br/>
"This is the right way." (Makoto)<br/>
I walk on the surface of the water.<br/>
Water Magic: Surface Walk.<br/>
"Chantless as if natural, huh." (Lucy)<br/>
"Here, come." (Makoto)<br/>
I beckon Lucy.<br/>
"I can’t use Surface Walk. Or more like, what are we doing after that?" (Lucy)<br/>
"It’s okay, it’s okay. Give me your hand." (Makoto)<br/>
Without waiting for an answer, I grab her by the sleeve and pull her to the stream. <br/>
"Kya!" (Lucy)<br/>
"Don’t let go, alright? The effect of the spell will cut off if you do." (Makoto)<br/>
"Don’t pull me all of a sudden!" (Lucy)<br/>
Support magic like Surface Walk can be shared by staying in contact with a part of the user’s body.<br/>
The effect disappears once you separate.<br/>
Well, I can just cast for two people, but this way, I can save mana. <br/>
"The surface of the water is this cushiony, huh. Feels weird." (Lucy)<br/>
"Hold on tight. We will be going at quite the speed after all." (Makoto)<br/>
"Eh? What do you mean by that?" (Lucy)<br/>
[Water Magic: Water Current]<br/>
"Eh? Eeeeeh?!" (Lucy)<br/>
Lucy raises a voice of shock.<br/>
We move forward on top of the stream.<br/>
"Only the water at our feet is moving?!" (Lucy)<br/>
Fufu, she is surprised.<br/>
"What’s this?!" (Lucy)<br/>
"A variation to Water Current I suppose. I call it Moving Water Road." (Makoto)<br/>
The image I use for this is the railroad in a train station.<br/>
This world probably doesn’t use it in this way.<br/>
"What a weird name for a spell…" (Lucy)<br/>
"Shut it. I am raising the speed." (Makoto)<br/>
"Wait wait, my heart is not ready yet—" (Lucy)<br/>
I speed up at once.<br/>
This moment of acceleration feels the best.<br/>
"Kyaaaaaa!!" (Lucy)<br/>
A scream echoes in the forest.<br/>
"Oi, don’t raise your voice." (Makoto)<br/>
"Don’t ask for the impossible!" (Lucy)<br/>
We cut across the forest in one go.<br/>
◇◇<br/>
 "Wait, let me rest for a bit. I might have gotten dizzy from that." (Lucy)<br/>
Lucy staggers her way to a tree and leans on it.<br/>
"Sorry, I sped up too much." (Makoto)<br/>
Gotta reflect.<br/>
I got way into it.<br/>
"No, it is okay. That’s incredible. We arrived close to the Demonic Forest in 30 minutes. So you were moving in this way until now, huh." (Lucy)<br/>
"Yeah, we arrived quickly, right?" (Makoto)<br/>
"Is this really the area around the Demonic Forest?" (Lucy)<br/>
"Yeah, that’s why, don’t go raising your voice here. We would get surrounded by goblins." (Makoto)<br/>
"Eh?!" (Lucy)<br/>
Lucy hurriedly grabs my sleeves again.<br/>
"Around how many?" (Lucy)<br/>
"Around 40, I think. Just like usual." (Makoto)<br/>
"Eeh?! That’s a lot!" (Lucy)<br/>
"That’s just how this place is. We have a good amount of distance from the closest one, and the mist today is thick, so the chance is low that we will get noticed. It’s gonna be okay." (Makoto)<br/>
"Y-You are used to this, huh." (Lucy)<br/>
"I come here everyday after all." (Makoto)<br/>
"As expected of the Goblin Cleaner." (Lucy)<br/>
Stop with that nickname!<br/>
"For now, let’s go hunt a random one close by." (Makoto)<br/>
If it is a monster near here, Lucy should be able to take her time chanting her magic.<br/>
◇◇<br/>
 -Lucy POV-<br/>
"Then, wait a bit." (Makoto)<br/>
Saying this, Makoto disappeared inside the mist.<br/>
He must be erasing the sound of his footsteps with Stealth.<br/>
I can’t feel his presence anymore.<br/>
"Don’t leave me alone in a place like this…" (Lucy)<br/>
When my mind realised that this is nearby the Demonic Forest, I suddenly got anxious.<br/>
"!" <br/>
I heard the slight sound of something from afar.<br/>
I am an elf, so I have good ears.<br/>
Even so, it was a sound so slight that I could even pass it off as my imagination.<br/>
After a while, Makoto returns.<br/>
"I defeated one." (Makoto)<br/>
"You can tell me that, but I can’t see you." (Lucy)<br/>
I say this as if sulking.<br/>
A rustling sound was made.<br/>
A small goblin is looking here?! <br/>
It was making the movement to call its comrades.<br/>
"Makoto!" (Lucy)<br/>
"It is okay." (Makoto)<br/>
When Makoto raised his hand towards the goblin, suddenly, something white was covering the mouth and eyes of the goblin.<br/>
That’s…he is controlling the mist?<br/>
"?!" <br/>
The goblin seems to be flustered unable to let out its voice.<br/>
Makoto approached it without making a sound, and stabbed the heart of the goblin with his dagger.<br/>
The blade cuts in smoothly, but there’s no blood spurting out. <br/>
The dagger was also clean even when it was pulled out. <br/>
The goblin collapses.<br/>
There was no sound of it falling.<br/>
He probably erased the sound with Stealth.<br/>
(He controlled the mist while using skills, and he is controlling even the blood so that he doesn’t get stained in blood?) (Lucy)<br/>
This guy is doing quite the outrageous things as if nothing.<br/>
"See?" (Makoto)<br/>
Don’t make that face of ‘Easy right?’.<br/>
Is this the appearance of a mage that has polished his magic proficiency? Amazing.<br/>
…Just that, what he is doing looks more like an assassin.<br/>
"I will go hunt a few more." (Makoto)<br/>
Saying this, Makoto disappears in the mist again.<br/>
"This is today’s result." (Makoto)<br/>
Makoto hunted 10 goblins in around an hour.<br/>
What he basically did was use Stealth to approach them silently and hunt them.<br/>
If he gets unlucky and gets noticed before he gets close enough, he immediately covers their mouth and eyes with magic.<br/>
As a result, they couldn’t call their comrades.<br/>
"There’s a lot of mist around here, so I can use my magic as much as I want." (Makoto)<br/>
"The Demonic Forest is covered in mist all year long after all." (Lucy)<br/>
Everyone has been asking the question of why the rookie Makoto always goes to a dangerous place like the Demonic Forest to hunt. That mystery has been solved.<br/>
"I have low mana, so I can only use cheap magic like this." (Makoto)<br/>
"Is it cheap?" (Lucy)<br/>
I think it is quite impressive.<br/>
"By the way, can you show me your magic next, Lucy?" (Makoto)<br/>
Oh, it finally came.<br/>
"If I remember correctly, it takes time to chant, right?" (Makoto)<br/>
"Yeah…at the minimum, more than 3 minutes." (Lucy)<br/>
"That’s long." (Makoto)<br/>
Uuh, did he get disappointed?<br/>
"Well, fine. I have defeated most of the goblins around, so even if it is a long chant, they shouldn’t be able to notice immediately,  I think." (Makoto)<br/>
"So you thought that far?" (Lucy)<br/>
"Since we have the chance here, I wanted to take my time and look at Monarch Magic." (Makoto)<br/>
Makoto’s eyes are glittering.<br/>
His eyes are brimming with expectation.<br/>
Eh? His character changed?<br/>
I thought he was more of the cool type of person though. <br/>
"Then, I will prepare." (Lucy)<br/>
I cannot fail.<br/>
I separated from Jean and Emily’s party after a quarrel, and there’s already no people in the Adventurer Guild that I can join a party with in Makkaren.<br/>
I begin chanting.<br/>
I say that, but it is the Elementary Grade Fire Spell: Fireball.<br/>
"Wow!" (Makoto)<br/>
Makoto mutters.<br/>
The fireball steadily gets bigger.<br/>
1 meter, 2 meters…<br/>
In the end, a fireball as big as a house was made on top of me.<br/>
"Isn’t this…dangerous?" (Makoto)<br/>
Makoto’s face stiffened.<br/>
But I am concentrating on my spell and don’t have the leeway to answer him.<br/>
My hands tremble.<br/>
It is taking me my all to keep the giant mass of fire that I generated.<br/>
"[FIREBALL]!!" (Lucy)<br/>
I release the giant fireball to the front.<br/>
A big sound of something heavy falling to the ground along with the shaking of the ground.<br/>
*Whooom!* A fire pillar raises as if trying to burn the sky.<br/>
Now that the mana has left my body, I feel a bit lightheaded.<br/>
Aah, what a relief!<br/>
"Hmph, the expected firepower from me!" (Lucy)<br/>
"That’s impressive. The trees of the Great Forest that are supposed to be strong against fire are burning." (Makoto)<br/>
Makoto says this impressed.<br/>
It has been a while since I used around 10% of the fireball power.<br/>
It felt good.<br/>
Ah, but the intensity of the fire is too strong?<br/>
The magic trees of the Great Forest are hard to burn.<br/>
But the trees were blazing up as if that didn’t matter.<br/>
E-Eh? <br/>
Wait, did I overdo it?<br/>
...It ended up in a fire.<br/>
