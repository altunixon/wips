<p>Sevens Question Corner 4</p>
<p>Q: Even if all the ancestors disappear, will the Best Lyle awards remain behind in the Jewel?</p>
<p>A: Third Generation (`・ω・´): “Let’s make it happen!”</p>
<p>Lyle (∩゜д゜): “… I didn’t hear anything, I didn’t see anything.”</p>
<p>&#8211;</p>
<p>Q: Did the ancestors have a stream of mistakes through Growth as well?</p>
<p>A: Second Generation Σ(´∀｀||;): “No, that part’s a little… I don’t recall.”</p>
<p>&#8211;</p>
<p>Q: Lyle’s no good. I can’t understand Novem’s supremacy in this relationship. He’s not of the right caliber to make a Harem.</p>
<p>A: Lyle ( ゜д゜): “Agreement. But I can’t really hate Novem after she’s done so much, and even if you say I’m no good, I just love Novem. Harem? I have absolutely no intentions of making one. What of it?”</p>
<p>&#8211;</p>
<p>Q: Shouldn’t you start with training personal ability from the start? The ancestors’ actions are all over the place.</p>
<p>A: Fourth Generation (-@∀@): “We thought he was a technique type, but it was only in Part Two did we realize he just took a long time to experience Growth. I agree that area was definitely a strange one, but he was able to master the Skills several times quicker than we imagined, so we kinda just figured, ‘hey, shouldn’t we kinda put a restriction on him’ at some point. There was no helping it.”</p>
<p>&#8211;</p>
<p>Q: Lyle’s reputation among the adventurers and the guild is way too low.</p>
<p>A: Fifth Generation (´・д・｀): “In this world, placing a correct evaluation on something is not an easy task. It’s because feelings exist as well. Even if you say there’s no gap between male and female adventurers, try imagining Lyle being carried out by a legion of beauties… don’t you find that irritating? It’s something like that.”</p>
<p>&#8211;</p>
<p>Q: You guys rely too much on those poor Forxuzes. Yet the Fifth suddenly turned them into a vassal house. Is he an idiot?</p>
<p>A: Fifth Generation （　゜д゜）: “Oy, yes, I’m an idiot… there were lots of circumstances going on around the time! There’s also the fact the Fourth Generation had screwed up too much.”</p>
<p>Fourth Generation (-@∀@): “… No, but they did raise me up when I was a child, and I became head around ten, right? What’s more, the Third died, and I had to inherit various things, so… I couldn’t help but rely on them, right?”</p>
<p>&#8211;</p>
<p>Q: I have a premonition a Quilin’s going to come out as a heroine. Could it be Novem’s true form is a…</p>
<p>A: Fifth Generation Σ(゜Д゜；): “You think I wouldn’t have noticed dat fluff!?”</p>
<p>&#8211;</p>
<p>Q: I want to see Poyopoyo’s backstory.</p>
<p>A: MonicaΣｂ( ｀・ω・´)GUH: “How splendid. But unfortunately… I was first started up when I met that chicken dickhead. Please think of me as being zero years old.”</p>
<p>&#8211;</p>
<p>Q: You won’t make your swords of the same material as Porter?</p>
<p>A: Monica (´・д・｀): “Well, it’s armor scraps, so if we were to put it to full use, I guess it would be as protective equipment… if we’re going that far, then I guess buying a normal high-priced sword may be the safer option. If it’s drills, I can prepare them at a moment’ notice, though.”</p>
<p>Lyle DO NOT (゜⊿゜) WANT</p>
<p>&#8211;</p>
<p>Q: Can the First’s Skill, and the large sword be used freely?</p>
<p>A: Lyle (´・ω・`): “I could have used them if I wanted to, but due to the tasks, I had them sealed off myself. Because the moment I used them, I would have failed the task anyways.”</p>
<p>&#8211;</p>
<p>Q: About Arumsaas’ guild’s treatment, and the punishments. It’s not enough!</p>
<p>A: Sixth Generation (´・∀・｀ ): “… The guild is currying favor with the Academy, and he’s Damien’s friend. If I say that much, you get it, right? Arumsaas’ guild sees that academy they can’t go against as Lyles ally. So what would happen to a staff member who sold out information knowing it would lead to a raid against him… there’s also the injured adventurers he saved, and others he helped in town, so… oh, that’s enough of that.”</p>
<p>&#8211;</p>
<p>Q: I’m tired of stories about the resolve to kill. Get over it!</p>
<p>A: Seventh Generation (・∀・): “The resolve to kill? Do you understand why so many such scenes exist? Without that, what would you empathize with&#8230; wait, you’re’ serious about this? Well, if you want to consider this world’s sense of values… they’re been adventurers for little over half a year…”</p>
<p>…</p>
<p>Lyle ( ゜Д゜): “Should I bring back the attackers’ ***** with me? It’ll serve as a nice threat. Or perhaps their ***** ****** would be better?”</p>
<p>Novem (´・∀・｀ ): “That’s heavy, so how about we settle for their ****** or ****? Ah, of course, we’re collecting their guild cards, and valuables.”</p>
<p>Aria (゜д゜): “I’ll definitely never forgive that guild receptionist! Let’s make an example of him. We’re hanging up his *******, alright!”</p>
<p>Miranda (｀・ω・´): “If it’s *******, then I happen to be an expert on the subject! I’ll take out his ************* alive, and soak it in his ****!”</p>
<p>Shannon (´ぅω・｀): “That’ll be noisy, so make sure you stuff his mouth first. You’ll disturb the neighbors.”</p>
<p>Clara (´-ω-｀): “Do you want to sell off the families of the ones that sold information as slaves? The men to the mines, and the women to the streets. For the children, there are some people with… special hobbies out there…”</p>
<p>Monica Σ(゜Д゜；): “Humans are scarrrryy!!”</p>
<p>Heads of History: ”Oh my, you kids are still much too soft…”</p>
<p>…</p>
<p>Seventh Generation ( ゜Д゜): “… See? Not a millimeter of empathy, right? If they could do it, that would be scary in itself. If you go to too high of an extreme, it becomes like that. At present, Lyle, Novem, and Aria would still kill in revenge if one of their comrades were killed off. Miranda and Shannon would be a little hesitant to do it personally. Clara has a certain extent of experience as an adventurer, so she may be used to it. There was a need to keep it mildly mild, so it ended up like this.”</p>
<p>Fifth Generation (・∀・): “To add onto that, Lyle set it up so they would get annihilated regardless. He was more than resolved.”</p>
<p>&#8211;</p>
<p>Q: Despite being a group with considerable competence in using Skills, they entered the labyrinth without adequate preparations, and they were in a situation where it would’ve been possible for them do die off without Lyle even doing anything. Why not put a little more thought into it?</p>
<p>A: Second Generation (´・д・｀): “If the attacking squad was just a little more careful, it would be Lyle’s group that was annihilated. Story ends there. Thanks for reading.”</p>
<p>Third Generation (´・∀・｀ ): “And so what if they had Skills? There’s no meaning if they don’t master them, and we used our powers to put those conceited SOBs in their places. But is that something strange? They seemed to be reliant on Skills, and Lyle was in a state without them up to recently. In order for him not to become like that, we put the restrictions up, didn’t we?”</p>
<p>Fourth Generation (-@∀@): “The enemy had their preparations in place. It’s just that it was insufficient to aim for the Thirtieth floor. By the way, they were taking measures to annihilate Lyle’s party, and on top of that… we stuck a 「Double Standards」 tag onto the story’s genre, so we should be fine.”</p>
<p>&#8211;</p>
<p>Q: You wrote there were some who could stomach magic water out there, so I can’t imagine all of them being wiped out. The ancestors’ stance that it was absolutely impossible is questionable.</p>
<p>A: Lyle(´・ω・`): “… If their remnants would have been able to safely return in that state, I would never have created Porter in the first place. Would a group that was known to have attacked those of their same trade actually cooperate with one another with their limited supply of consumables to aim for the surface? If all that was possible, we wouldn’t have done that.”</p>
