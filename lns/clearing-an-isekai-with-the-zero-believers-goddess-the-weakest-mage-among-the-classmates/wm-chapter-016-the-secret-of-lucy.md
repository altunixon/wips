TLN: Hey guys, Reigokai here!<br/>
Now that the boost week is over, it is about time to decide a schedule. Judging from the length of the chapters, I would say a schedule of: 1 chapter – 1 chapter – no chapter.<br/>
The author has a tendency of varying the length of his chapters, just hope it isn’t as crazy as some of Tsuki where they go beyond 40 pages at times, lol.<br/>
Anyways, enjoy! :DDD!!<br/>
<br/>
"Demon?" (Makoto)<br/>
Lucy begins to speak with a grim face.<br/>
"Yeah, that’s right…" (Lucy)<br/>
"You are an elf, right?" (Makoto)<br/>
"My mother is an elf. But my father isn’t. My mother married a demon somewhere, and I am the child." (Lucy)<br/>
A mix of elf and demon, huh.<br/>
No wonder she is strong.<br/>
"According to my mother, my father is a demon that had his whole body covered in fire. I inherited that blood of his, and it made my fire magic powerful." (Lucy)<br/>
"Fire on his whole body, you say. How did they even make a baby?" (Makoto)<br/>
"That’s not the issue here!" (Lucy)<br/>
She got angry.<br/>
I think it is the natural question though.<br/>
"Thanks to my fire mana, I can use powerful magic, and have strong fire resistance, but I can’t use weak fire magic. I am bad at controlling it, and it ends up going out of control quickly. Also, the reason my body temperature is abnormally high is because of this." (Lucy)<br/>
"Aah, so that’s why you wear so thinly." (Makoto)<br/>
The mystery has been solved.<br/>
"The reason why your whole body was burned in your synchronization was most likely because it was me. It shouldn’t happen if you do it with others…" (Lucy)<br/>
Looks like Lucy is feeling pretty down from this.<br/>
"If you had those circumstances, it can’t be helped. Next time, let’s go with some other method." (Makoto)<br/>
Lucy had a dumbfounded expression as she raised her head.<br/>
"Makoto, you are going to continue partying with me?" (Lucy)<br/>
"Why do you think I wouldn’t?" (Makoto)<br/>
"Because I didn’t help out this time at all! I pulled the monsters. On top of that, I injured you!" (Lucy)<br/>
She shouts with tears in her eyes.<br/>
"You did help out", I got burned for that though.<br/>
"You were seriously injured!" (Lucy)<br/>
"Don’t mind it that much. Everyone fails every now and then." (Makoto)<br/>
"But! Our training lately hasn’t made any progress. I don’t know what I should do…" (Lucy)<br/>
Hmm, she is quite down.<br/>
How do I console her?<br/>
"Hey, don’t you think I am a pain? Are you…continuing this out of obligation because Lucas-san and Mary-san told you?" (Lucy)<br/>
She is running into negative thoughts.<br/>
I don’t really think of it as a pain.<br/>
I am actually having fun thinking about how to use the powerful magic of Lucy which feels kinda like I’m solving a puzzle.<br/>
But I feel like if I tell her it is as fun as playing puzzle games, she would get angry.<br/>
Hmm, how troubling.<br/>
"Lucy…" (Makoto)<br/>
I held the hand she was using to grab me.<br/>
"I need you, Lucy. Let’s do our best together." (Makoto)<br/>
I say this seriously while looking at her eyes.<br/>
I am looking at it with [RPG Player] from the side.<br/>
Uwaa, I am saying quite the embarrassing thing.<br/>
"E-Eh?! U-Uhm, I got it, I will do my best!" (Lucy)<br/>
Lucy had a beet red face and was going ‘awawa’.<br/>
Did I exaggerate it too much there?<br/>
It should be okay.<br/>
(Haah.) (Noah)<br/>
I heard the sigh of the Goddess.<br/>
Was that no good? <br/>
◇◇<br/>
A while after that, I concentrated on the treatment of my burns. <br/>
Or so I say, but I am simply doing nothing at the resting area of the guild.<br/>
Boring.<br/>
Lucy was doing her best in increasing her fire proficiency. <br/>
I had Lucy teach me about the new skill that I got, [Spirit User].<br/>
"Spirits cannot be seen." (Lucy)<br/>
"How do you control them if you can’t see them?" (Makoto)<br/>
"It is the same as normal magic. Chanting. You have to use Spirit Language though." (Lucy)<br/>
Another language again, huh.<br/>
Learning it will be tough.<br/>
"No choice but to begin learning from the easy stuff. I should go to a secondhand bookstore later." (Makoto)<br/>
"There’s no spirit magic books in Makkaren, you know." (Lucy)<br/>
"Eh? Why?" (Makoto)<br/>
"There’s no humans who are Spirit Users." (Lucy)<br/>
Aah, right.<br/>
I did learn that in the temple.<br/>
"Then how am I going to learn it?" (Makoto)<br/>
"Hmm, this is a problem." (Lucy)<br/>
"Haah, I want to go hunt goblins quickly." (Makoto)<br/>
"No you can’t. You have to rest for 1 week more!" (Emily)<br/>
Emily, who was passing by, warned me.<br/>
"Yo, Jean." (Makoto)<br/>
"Hey, Makoto." (Jean)<br/>
I raise a hand and greet Jean.<br/>
He is apparently in the middle of training so that he can hunt Rampaging Bisons alone.<br/>
Sounds fun.<br/>
"Being in the guild the whole time yet being unable to go adventuring is torture." (Makoto)<br/>
I made 7 water balls float and juggle with them.<br/>
I have been training like this the whole time lately.<br/>
"You say that, yet you are doing something complicated there… Hey, Makoto…" (Lucy)<br/>
Lucy makes a serious face.<br/>
"What?" (Makoto)<br/>
"Uhm, Makoto, you are always sleeping in the resting area of the guild, right?" (Lucy)<br/>
"Yeah, paying for an inn would be a waste. Or more like, I don’t have the money." (Makoto)<br/>
What I earn from goblin hunting is practically insignificant.<br/>
Moreover, I can’t go earn money, so I am slowly losing weight.<br/>
I should be fine for around 1 week though…<br/>
Life in an Isekai isn’t easy.<br/>
"My grandfather works as the village chief of the elves. That’s why I get quite a lot of money sent to me, and I have a contract to stay for a long period of time in an inn." (Lucy)<br/>
"Yeah, I did hear that before." (Makoto)<br/>
A high class lady. I am jealous.<br/>
"T-That’s why…u-uhm…you see…" (Lucy)<br/>
"Lucy-san?" (Makoto)<br/>
"Wouldn’t it be better if you stay in a proper room, Makoto? If it is okay with you, you could…my room—" (Lucy)<br/>
Just before Lucy could finish saying her words that were already fading and hard to pick, someone cuts in.<br/>
"Makoto-kun! Have your injuries healed?" (Mary)<br/>
Mary-san hugged me from behind.<br/>
It is rare to see her not drunk.<br/>
It is still daytime after all.<br/>
"Mary-san, you are being too rough with an injured person." (Makoto)<br/>
"Wait, Mary! I am having an important talk here!" (Lucy)<br/>
Lucy raises her voice on the verge of snapping.<br/>
"Hmhmm, are you sure you should be treating me this badly?" (Mary)<br/>
Mary grins as she gives me a book.<br/>
"Wait, eh?! This is [Spirit Language for Dummies]?" (Makoto)<br/>
Wasn’t Makkaren supposed to not have this?<br/>
"I heard that you learned a new skill, Makoto-kun. I ordered it from the Spring Log Guild." (Mary)<br/>
‘It was hard, you know~’, says Mary-san.<br/>
"The Adventurer Guild of the Wood Country… There are a lot of elves and dwarves there, so it is possible…’, says Lucy.<br/>
"Mary-san, thank you very much!" (Makoto)<br/>
"Nufufu, it is okay, it is okay. Do your best, Makoto-kun." (Mary)<br/>
She petted my head.<br/>
Lucy is sulking at my side.,<br/>
Right, we were in the middle of our talk.<br/>
"Lucy, you were about to say something, right?" (Makoto)<br/>
"…"<br/>
Lucy isn’t looking my way.<br/>
"Lucy-san?" (Makoto)<br/>
"Not really." (Lucy)<br/>
Eh? What happened?<br/>
"Uhm, Mary-san, what’s the price of this book?" (Makoto)<br/>
"I don’t need the money. But it is guild property, so you have to return it, okay? I am simply lending it to you." (Mary)<br/>
"Understood. Thanks." (Makoto)<br/>
What a relief.<br/>
I don’t have much at hand.<br/>
Mary-san goes ‘bye~’ and returns to work.<br/>
"Aah, that really helps. With this, I can train with Spirit Magic." (Makoto)<br/>
"…" <br/>
What should I do about Lucy who is for some reason in a bad mood?<br/>
"Oi, Lucy-san?" (Makoto)<br/>
"…Hey, Makoto…" (Lucy)<br/>
"Y-Yes?" (Makoto)<br/>
"Dummy!" (Lucy)<br/>
She ran off.<br/>
It was really hard to console Lucy that day at dinner, or more like, in her heavy drinking.<br/>
