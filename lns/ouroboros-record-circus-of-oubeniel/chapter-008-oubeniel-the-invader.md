Chapter VIII – Oubeniel, the Invader<br/>
The time I spent traveling with a carriage took longer that I had initially thought.<br/>
Unlike modern cars, its source of power is a living thing. If its source of power gets tired, then it’d have to eat fodder. Well, since I am me, I can actually alter my horse to improve its speed, horsepower and endurance. But publicly possessing an animal with abnormal ability has the risk of me being suspected of  ‘unlawful possession of magical beasts’. Basically, when it comes to magical beasts, such as unicorns —– I don’t know how they tell them apart from normal monsters though—- , one can’t simply possess them without the consent of the royal family.<br/>
However, it was because of that long travel duration that I was able to carefully readjust M-03 who went haywire due to an unexpected incident, so I suppose it was a blessing in disguise. Currently, she’s in the recovery phase and it’ll take some moments for her until she can work like the other slaves. Later, after I open another lab in my land, I’ll have to do a thorough examination on her again.<br/>
While thinking deeply about such matter, I look at the outside views from the window of the carriage. We have finally entered the Viscounty of Marlin, our destination. As far as I can see there’s only weary peasants with their desolate fields. Are we really in the "Land of Fine Arts and Black Earth, Arquell"?<br/>
In addition, apparently monster subjugation has gone into a halt around this area. Uni and Due had to work not quite a few times on the way here.<br/>
I saw this coming, but to think he’d push me a land this horrible…<br/>
"Milord. That older brother of yours sure hates you…"<br/>
"Seems like it. In order to harass his little brother, he gave me these farmers who were neglected by their lord, it’s unbearable, don’t you think?"<br/>
Totally, Due said as he shrugs. He’s the only person in my carriage for now. Usually Uni is the one who would never leave my side.<br/>
– Knock.<br/>
There was a sound from the roof of the carriage, but when Due unconsciously reaches for his two-handed sword…<br/>
– Knock, knock-knock, knock.<br/>
I heard a peculiar rhythmic knocking from above.<br/>
It was a predetermined cue.<br/>
While I raise my hand to restrain Due, I called up towards to the carriage’s roof.<br/>
TL Note: He raised his hand to signify that it’s safe, if you didn’t catch the drift.<br/>
"Welcome back, Uni"<br/>
And then she opened the moving carriage’s door and went inside.<br/>
I’ve told Uni to go on ahead to collect some information. She does have some ranger skills for her investigative quests. Something like investigating idle petty officials should be easy peasy.<br/>
"I have returned, Master. As expected, the governance in this place seems to be blatantly flawed."<br/>
She presented me a document regarding local deputy houses that divided the rule of this viscounty into three. Of course, the document that Uni brought is the copy instead of the original.<br/>
"Thank you for your hard work. Let me see… Ugh, this is just terrible. Illegal control of grain distributions and embezzlement of irrigation expenditures? Leaving bribes for water rights disputes aside….. they also bribe the kingdom’s auditors in order to misrepresent the audit on them. The tax rate is ninety percent. Oi, oi, doesn’t that mean the folks below will always be in a state of famine?"<br/>
TL Note: The original words used as a tax rate was "九公一民", which means "nine for the lord, one for the people". It’s based on a system from the feudal times (or at least, in feudal Japan) when the lord of the land would take the farmers’ harvest by setting up a portion to divide them as tax (they didn’t know percentage back then). I put 90% there to simplify things.<br/>
"Many farmers seems to have financed their livelihoods by selling their family members as slaves."<br/>
TL Note: The original just said that they were selling slaves, it was strongly implied that they were selling their own family members as recounted in the previous chapter. Though it’s also possible that they sold themselves too.<br/>
"So that means, I might have had some ‘guests’ from here too? I wonder if this is what they call, ‘punitive justice’?"<br/>
"… You, how come did you find this much in less than a day?"<br/>
"That’s because I’m a maid. Mansion infiltration is our specialty."<br/>
"That’s, not quite normal though?"<br/>
And so my opuses made merry about miscellaneous things. I didn’t participate in their conversation as I was busy thinking of things to do with this devastated territory. In any case, I’ve decided my first move.<br/>

"Am I glad to finally see you, new Viscount-sama!"<br/>
The man who seems to be the deputy that reigns the town from its government building extended his hands widely to express his welcome to me. Behind him are two men that seems to be the other deputies. They are making this obsequious, sycophantic smile at me, but there’s also this feeling of jealousy towards the first man oozing out from them. Probably they feel that the first man has stolen a march on them as he gets to host me at this time.<br/>
Perhaps to prick the men behind him, and moreover, as he reminds himself of his sense of superiority, the man was unusually in high spirits.<br/>
"It was a long journey for you, and I daresay you must be tired! Today, I have prepared a bath and other things for you! Well, please come to our humble abode! It does not compare with my lord’s mansion back in the capital, but please make yourself at home."<br/>
His disposition was truly unctuous. Even though now that I’m posted here and consequently he can no longer freely do things he had been doing around this place up until now, I see he’s still quite the sly racoon dog. Most likely, he’s scheming to undermine me by playing things nicely to win my favour, in turn, that would get him appointed as my right-hand man. But against his move, I—-<br/>
