Chapter 139: The Shield’s Brand<br/>
It’s been a week since I acquired my land and began babysitting these kids.<br/>
The Soldiers have pretty much finished restoring most of the salvageable houses. I guess It’s time to start on the next stage of the plan.<br/>
Following Firo’s orders, the new Filo Rial is pulling the carriage back and forth.<br/>
I guess it will be nice to ride in a carriage that doesn’t talk back for once…<br/>
I’m currently playing fetch with Firo in relatively good spirits. I’m doing it while the other slaves are asleep, as Firo does not care about her surroundings.<br/>
The Catipilands have also become quite large, and we are currently building a carriage for them. This monster seems to be a herbivore that enjoys gnawing on Bioplant stalks.<br/>
This kills two birds in one stone. The Slave dealer does good work, it’s also quite easy to handle.<br/>
It’s only fault is its speed. It can’t go very fast, or far. Visiting the neighboring towns seems to be its limit.<br/>
The Dune Worms have become relatively large as well. I’m leaving the maintenance of the soil around here to them.<br/>
This monster is also quite docile. Wild Dunes seem to spend their lives peacefully underground. It is very rare for one to get into a fight.<br/>
Domestic Dune will fight if ordered, but they aren’t very strong.<br/>
Well then, I think it’s time to restart my peddling.<br/>
"H-how is it?" (Kiel)<br/>
I had prepared two sets of clothing for Kiel.<br/>
The first was one fit for her preferences, a manly set of armor.<br/>
The other one is a frilly one-piece.<br/>
Kiel is blushing and waiting for my appraisal.<br/>
"Perfect. Make sure you act clumsy and embarrassed while we sell things." (Naofumi)<br/>
"Shield Nii-chan! Why do I have to do something like this!?" (Kiel)<br/>
"Of course, for the money. If we don’t have funds, we cannot restore the village." (Naofumi)<br/>
"…I-I’m embarrassed, Nii-chan…" (Kiel)<br/>
I plan to have Firo manage the front, while I watch over the stock.<br/>
I also plan to sell medicines made by Kiel (with Rafatalia’s help).<br/>
"Rishia, I leave the village’s management and level raising to you." (Naofumi)<br/>
"G-got it!" (Rishia)<br/>
I need to teach the slaves how to peddle.<br/>
If I don’t then raising funds will get increasingly difficult.<br/>
If I circle the country with a carriage advertising my brand, rumors should spread quickly.<br/>
That’s why I have been spending all of my free time making medicines.<br/>
By the way, due to the teachings in compounding I received before the battle with the Spirit Turtle, I can make some advanced medicines as well.<br/>
As long as I’m there, we should be able to solve most problems, including serious disease.<br/>
Though this is just my opinion.<br/>
"Then, we’re off-!" (Naofumi)<br/>
"Wai- Nii-chan! I still haven’t gotten used to vehi-" (Kiel)<br/>
Ignoring Kiel, we set off.<br/>
It only took one hour to visit the neighboring villages. This is all thanks to Firo’s legs.<br/>
I see some familiar faces as I go from town to town. It’s a bit of a strange feeling.<br/>
"Saint-sama was the Hero of the shield?" (Customer)<br/>
"Yeah… I thought it would be bad for business if my identity got out." (Naofumi)<br/>
"I apologize for my behavior back then." (Customer)<br/>
"Don’t let it bother you." (Naofumi)<br/>
The bad rumors about me have already died down.<br/>
Even though I hadn’t done anything at the time, I was still being called the Devil of the Shield.<br/>
I had been faced with quite a bit of undue resentment.<br/>
But I don’t have any reason to mull over it now. As long as I get paid, I don’t mind.<br/>
I don’t put customers before everything else. Those were the words of an actor. This is reality.<br/>
"I got some land, and am training some people to combat the wave. In order to prepare for it, I am also selling medicine and arms. If you need anything, please ask. You can find me in the carriage marked with the Shield insignia." (Naofumi)<br/>
Right now, there is a Sign with a picture of a shield attached to the side of my carriage.<br/>
"It’s only been a couple of days since you defeated that monster, but the hero of the shield is already trying to help the populace. You must really care for this country’s people." (Customer)<br/>
"Yeah, but there isn’t too much I can do by myself. If you would spread the word of the Shield Brand, I would be grateful." (Naofumi)<br/>
And thus, like this, I spread the name of my peddling business.<br/>
Firo also serves as a form of advertisement, as she is a Filo Rial Queen.<br/>
But her constant chatter is annoying.<br/>
If I had someone to manage her, it would be helpful, but I don’t think there are many who would like to deal with her.<br/>
"I’ll buy some things to support the efforts of the Shield." (Customer)<br/>
"Much obliged." (Naofumi)<br/>
And, for once, the rumors were working in my favor.<br/>
The good rumors of my carriage spread like wildfire.<br/>
Some people rush to greet us as we arrive at certain towns.<br/>
It’s quite remarkable that gossip can travel faster than Firo’s legs.<br/>
"S-shield Niichan… Are you sure this is alright?" (Kiel)<br/>
Kiel, who is managing sales, comes up to me with an embarrassed face.<br/>
"Yeah, your business smile isn’t as good as Rafatalia’s, but some people might find your clumsy, awkward display to be a turn-on." (Naofumi)<br/>
"Is that supposed to be a complement?" (Kiel)<br/>
Yes. Clumsy, innocent characters seem to have a healing effect on people. This holds true in any world.<br/>
Rafatalia and Firo are also doing well. It seems that I will be making quite a bit of profit from this enterprise.<br/>
Our sales are quite steady.<br/>
At this stage, we can’t really spare personnel to gather herbs.<br/>
However, even the worst of ingredients can be made into medicine of ‘Normal’ quality with the shield.<br/>
These ‘Normal’ medicines can then be compounded by hand to make higher level medicines of quality greater than normal.<br/>
I can expect quite a bit in this trip.<br/>
For now, I need to prepare enough medicine for all the towns we will stop at. It’s good that I prepared a lot before-hand.<br/>
We continue our peddling for the next three days before returning to the village. We occasionally buy herbs from passing merchants.<br/>
I feed these to the shield to make more medicine.<br/>
Kiel and the other slaves observed my actions and learn how to peddle, or at least that was the plan.<br/>
"My, my, if it isn’t the Hero of the Shield." (Slave Dealer)<br/>
When it gets dark, the Slave Dealer appears at the village.<br/>
He is accompanied by some sturdy-built adults. It’s a bit of a surreal scene.<br/>
The other slaves hide in fear.<br/>
"What is it? It’s rare seeing you outside of your store." (Naofumi)<br/>
"How are you doing? How are the slaves?" (Slave Dealer)<br/>
"We’re moving ahead on schedule. Anyways, why are you here? Answer me." (Naofumi)<br/>
"That’s good to hear." (Slave Dealer)<br/>
So you won’t answer!<br/>
Calm down… don’t get swept up into his pace.<br/>
"Today, I came here to deliver the slaves ordered by the Hero of the Shield. Yes" (Slave Dealer)<br/>
"Ah, so you were able to find them?" (Naofumi)<br/>
"Yes." (Slave Dealer)<br/>
The Slave Dealer goes into his carriage, and out come about 10 people. They are all shaking in fear.<br/>
Rafatalia looks through them for people she knows.<br/>
She talks to them in the same way that she talked to Kiel.<br/>
But…<br/>
"There are 3 children here that I don’t know." (Rafatalia)<br/>
"Hmm? Did I make a mistake?" (Slave Dealer)<br/>
The Slave Dealer claps his hands, and his men move to return the 3 children to the carriage.<br/>
"You don’t have to worry about it?" (Naofumi)<br/>
"And why would that be?" (Slave Dealer)<br/>
The slave dealer tilts his head.<br/>
"I don’t plan to only use people from this village. As long as they don’t bear any extreme hatred towards me, I will take them in." (Naofumi)<br/>
(TL: Well, he literally says as long as they aren’t radicals of the shield faith)<br/>
I planned to hire other people as well, anyways. There’s no reason to go to the trouble of returning them.<br/>
There’s no downside of having more manpower.<br/>
"You all. Just because they’re not from this village, don’t leave them out. If I see any bullying, then I’ll sell the culprits without hesitation." (Naofumi)<br/>
"Ye~s" (Slaves)<br/>
My slaves answer as such.<br/>
Well, they may bond as fellow slaves… There shouldn’t be too much of a problem.<br/>
But with increasing numbers, there may be more problems. I should be cautious.<br/>
After the slave registration process finishes, I unchain them.<br/>
"Are you alright?" (Rafatalia)<br/>
Rafatalia, Firo, Rishia, Kiel and the other slaves comfort the shaking new recruits.<br/>
"… I’m fine…" (Slave)<br/>
It seems it will take a while for them to open up their hearts…<br/>
"Shield Nii-chan" (Kiel)<br/>
"What?" (Naofumi)<br/>
"Let’s make some food and have a welcoming party. Of course, Nii-chan is cooking." (Kiel)<br/>
Kiel answers with enthusiasm.<br/>
What do you mean, ‘Of course I’m cooking’?!<br/>
"…Well, I did it for you guys too." (Naofumi)<br/>
"Y-yeah!" (Kiel)<br/>
"The party was my intention from the start. Everyone, please help out." (Naofumi)<br/>
"Yes!" (Everyone not new)<br/>
A strange sense of camaraderie has been born among the slaves.<br/>
…This may be helpful sometime later.<br/>
"For your slaves to be this motivated, you sure are good at handling them. It makes my heart race." (Slave Dealer)<br/>
"Yeah, keep thinking that." (Naofumi)<br/>
I chuck a bag of coins at the Slave Dealer.<br/>
I don’t think I will be seeing any of that money again.<br/>
"Please continue to collect some useful Demi-human slaves." (Naofumi)<br/>
"As you command." (Slave Dealer)<br/>
Now, excluding Rafatalia and Rishia, the village has a total of 18 slaves.<br/>
Including monsters, I have amassed quite a few members.<br/>
"How about the monsters?" (Slave Dealer)<br/>
"Hmm… I will probably need more soon." (Naofumi)<br/>
"Then, I shall bring some with me the next time I arrive. Do you have any requests" (Slave Dealer)<br/>
"The same species as before will do just fine." (Naofumi)<br/>
"Understood. Now then, I must be taking my leave." (Slave Dealer)<br/>
"Yeah, just go already." (Naofumi)<br/>
And so, I drove away the Slave Dealer and his men… or not.<br/>
"I would like to partake in the Hero’s home-made meal as well. Yes." (Slave Dealer)<br/>
Yes? Your voice is too loud!<br/>
I don’t think he will leave until he eats.<br/>
Dammit.<br/>
"I understand. Though I don’t understand what people like about it so much. Just eat and leave." (Naofumi)<br/>
"I appreciate it. Yes." (Slave Dealer)<br/>
The Slave Dealer’s men follow him.<br/>
… Their presence is ruining the taste.<br/>
I have to think of some countermeasures for next time, or me having to cook will become standard practice.<br/>
