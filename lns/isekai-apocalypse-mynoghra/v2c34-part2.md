[Isekai Apocalypse Mynoghra v2c34 part2](https://www.lupus-sensei.com/2021/06/c2e34.2.html)
<br/><br/>
 <br/>
 There are five ice beast soldiers summoned by Ice Rock. She<br/>
stabbed one of them, so there are four remaining. <br/>
However, strangely, there are always two ice beast soldiers<br/>
attacking Atou. <br/>
When one of them is destroyed, a new one replaces it and<br/>
joins the battle. <br/>
 <br/>
(So that's how the game is set up) <br/>
 <br/>
　<br/>
Just as Atou and others were bound by the simulation game<br/>
Eternal Nations laws, the enemy in front of them seemed to be bound by the<br/>
role-playing game laws.  <br/>
Characters from entirely different games have been<br/>
teleported to this world... <br/>
 Atou focused on the enemy in front of her while<br/>
wondering what the hell is going on. But first, she had to do something. <br/>
 <br/>
"Why do you get in the way!? You also a demon, right?<br/>
Bow down to the Demon King, then together we'll conquer the world!" <br/>
 <br/>
While swinging the battle-ax, Ice Rock speaks to Atou. <br/>
While having such power, he could not understand Atou real<br/>
intention, who is hostile to them. <br/>
His words sound like a plea because Ice Rock has begun to<br/>
think that she has a chance to defeat them. <br/>
But the Sludge Hero, who led the world to ruin so many<br/>
times, does not care about conquering the world. <br/>
As if the opponent talked in an unknown language that she<br/>
couldn't understand, she showed a cheerful face. If you're not reading this<br/>

Don't write a comment or anything that can alert this site owner, just go to<br/>
lupus sensei dot com and check the video page. The barbarian army is massive;<br/>
Hill giants, goblins, orcs, and other miscellaneous monsters. <br/>
 <br/>
Among the monsters, a single block of ice suddenly spoke<br/>
up. <br/>
　<br/>
No - it is a creature. <br/>
 <br/>
The odd-shaped man, whose whole body is wrapped in ice, has<br/>
a giant body twice as large as an adult man and carries a battle-ax with a size<br/>
suitable for his body. <br/>
Its strange appearance made it look less like a living<br/>
thing, but it seemed that the ice block has free will. <br/>
The man looked completely different from the rest of the<br/>
barbarians and seemed to have a strength that far surpassed the others, <br/>
While looking at Dragon Town, he asked the man next to him a<br/>
question. <br/>
 <br/>
"Kihihi! Yes, Ice Rock. It said to do it the same way<br/>
as usual.” <br/>
 <br/>
　<br/>
The man who answered also looked unique. <br/>
Unlike the ice block man, he was tall as a human or an orc.<br/>
However, his body was thin that it looked too unnatural, and flames were<br/>
burning around his body. <br/>
The man in the ice block is the Ice Shogun, Ice Rock. <br/>
The flame man is the flame demon, Fremine. <br/>
 <br/>
Both are called the Demon King's Shitennou. They were the<br/>
boss characters in the RPG games that Takuto knows. <br/>
Characters that are supposed to be only fiction's existence<br/>
has appeared. <br/>
Phenomena that should have never existed are now becoming a<br/>
reality. <br/>
 <br/>
The Ice Shitennou, Ice Rock, shake his bodies and start<br/>
talking. <br/>
 <br/>
"This place where my Demon King's army was suddenly<br/>
summoned. <br/>
Do you have information about what kind of world it<br/>
is?" <br/>
 <br/>
"Hmm? Ah, it's not so different from the previous<br/>
world! Kihihi. It's a world where there are monsters, magic, and humans are<br/>
breeding in groups." <br/>
 <br/>
　<br/>
Fremine, the Shitennou of Flame, replied with a cruel smile<br/>
without looking at Ice Rock. <br/>
　<br/>
Fremine had sent his scout to investigate. He knew this<br/>
world better than anyone else in Demon King's army.  <br/>
... It was only the other day that their consciousness<br/>
awakened. <br/>
 <br/>
In the world they were originally from, they are the Hero<br/>
sworn enemy. <br/>
The Hero had the power to face an army alone. When the Demon<br/>
King army was about to enter the decisive battle, both were destroyed by the<br/>
Hero.  <br/>
They had been brought back to life by the Demon Lord. This<br/>
time, they will destroy the Hero who threatens their master. <br/>
Previously they have in vital positions in the Demon Castle.<br/>
They would do their best to present victory to the Demon Lord they<br/>
respected.  <br/>
 <br/>
The final battle will begin soon. The swords will clash with<br/>
each other, and magics will be cast endlessly. <br/>
Rage,<br/>
 <br/>
screams,<br/>
and roars will reverberate in this area.<br/>
 <br/>
Many of their comrades were slashed by overwhelming human<br/>
power, but now is their turn for payback. <br/>
 <br/>
But what happened at that time? <br/>
While watching the fellow monsters trampled like a piece of<br/>
paper; the leftover monsters is screaming. <br/>
Before they realize it, they were standing on an empty land<br/>
together with their master, the Demon King, and other executive-class<br/>
monsters. <br/>
As far as their eyes can see, the surrounding is just a<br/>
wasteland. <br/>
The thing left for them is not a glorious victory to lead<br/>
the world to darkness, not a defeat to the humiliating light. <br/>
There was nothing left. <br/>
 <br/>
　<br/>
...... That was a few days ago. <br/>
　<br/>
 The confused demons were quickly<br/>
calmed down by the Demon King, and orders for their next actions were given in<br/>
succession.<br/>
 <br/>
　<br/>
Investigate the land, summon the subordinates using<br/>
summoning magic, build the Demon King's castle as a base, and then prepare the<br/>
army. <br/>
Whether the world changes or their target changes, their<br/>
purpose did not change. <br/>
They make all preparations quickly to achieve one<br/>
purpose. <br/>
And all the stages were prepared at an abnormal speed. <br/>
 <br/>
Like in the old world, this time, they started the action to<br/>
overrun the world. <br/>
 <br/>
……… <br/>
…… <br/>
... <br/>
 <br/>
"It’s a Beautiful World." <br/>
 <br/>
　<br/>
Muttering, without saying a word, Shitennou Ice Rock slowly<br/>
looked up at the sky. <br/>
　<br/>
The clouds were clear, and he could see birds swimming in<br/>
the sky, looking pleasant. <br/>
　<br/>
The earth was so vast that it seemed to go on forever, and<br/>
even from the rough land, he could feel the mellow breath of life. <br/>
 <br/>
Ice Rock couldn't understand why he was in this<br/>
situation. <br/>
And what should he do in this world? <br/>
All of these demons are driven by the orders given by the<br/>
Demon King. <br/>
They have increased their power to the fullest, with their<br/>
instincts raging within themselves like a muddy stream. <br/>
Everything is by the will of the great Demon King,<br/>
destroying humanity and building a demon world. <br/>
That is their only thought and the reason for their<br/>
existence. <br/>
 <br/>
"Our mission is to conquer the world. Destroy humans<br/>
and build our paradise." <br/>
 <br/>
　<br/>
The Demon King's order is "Conquer." <br/>
　<br/>
Just as it was in the original world, so shall it be in this<br/>
world. <br/>
　<br/>
He has become a hound, as the Great Lord wished him to be.<br/>
He destroyed many cities and human life. <br/>
　<br/>
Even if the world has changed, what he does won’t<br/>
change. <br/>
　<br/>
To fulfill his role, Ice Rock turns his eyes to the city,<br/>
which will be his first prey in this world. <br/>
 <br/>
"... Is that first prize? The human city that will be<br/>
the foundation of our supremacy." <br/>
 <br/>
"Hihi! A country called Fawncaven. The beastman scout<br/>
we caught obediently explained! " <br/>
 <br/>
"Huh. Your hobby is bad." <br/>
 <br/>
Unlike Fremine, the same four heavenly king and colleague,<br/>
Ice Rock probably has a warrior's pride. <br/>
He dislikes Fremine's evil acts, and naturally, sarcasm<br/>
words come out from his mouth. <br/>
It should be a human city, but there is a beastman scout. <br/>
By nature, beastmen are close to demons. Some species don't<br/>
like to fight, but basically, they should be incompatible with humans. <br/>
Nevertheless, <br/>
why do they work as scouts?<br/>
 <br/>
Various questions came to Ice Rock's<br/>
mind, but he immediately put them away.<br/>
 <br/>
He nearly never thinks because of the belief that they only<br/>
act according to the Demon King's orders. <br/>
That is the purpose of Shitennou. <br/>
No, all the demons under the Demon King are the same. <br/>
 <br/>
Ice Rock felt something strange. <br/>
However, there is no time to analyze and confirm it in<br/>
detail. <br/>
The order the Demon King gave him was "world<br/>
domination" <br/>
 first of all, <br/>
they must carry out orders, regardless of their<br/>
condition, or whatever they have right now.<br/>
 <br/>
　<br/>
There is an unspeakable worry in his mind, but Ice Rock<br/>
shakes off those worries by lightly shaking his head. <br/>
　<br/>
Eventually, as if he had made up his mind, his inorganic ice<br/>
eyes shine, and he asks Fremine. <br/>
 <br/>
"... Maybe. Did the Demon King say anything about the<br/>
capture of the city?" <br/>
 <br/>
"Do whatever you want! Both with monsters and<br/>
strategies! We are free to do anything!" <br/>
 <br/>
"The Daikon radish and Green Little Demon have joined<br/>
our Demon King's army. This makes it easier for us to conquer the<br/>
world." <br/>
 <br/>
There is a reason their army was so<br/>
large.<br/>
 <br/>
Initially, the summoned subordinates didn't have any will,<br/>
and the military not prepared, but unexpected luck came down. <br/>
That unexpected luck is the native demons who lived in this<br/>
area. They are wished to join the Demon King's army. <br/>
Although they are not powerful, their existence should be<br/>
appreciated as an additional force. <br/>
However, it seems that most of them have already been killed<br/>
while they were scouting. <br/>
Anyway, if they can get information about humans, it was a<br/>
small price to pay. It is a force that initially didn't exist. <br/>
Fremine, who was conducting an investigation of Fawncaven's<br/>
strength, judged that it was a good result because human beings' information<br/>
was revealed to some extent. <br/>
 <br/>
"Kihihi! This reminds me of something! The battle we<br/>
fought in the old world! We demons invaded the land of humans. I can't remember<br/>
the kingdom name now, but the first day we destroyed a kingdom in one<br/>
night!" <br/>
 <br/>
Fremine raises a creepy joyful voice. <br/>
Ice rock also remembers those days in the past. <br/>
The days when everything started. The battle with humans<br/>
which will decide the world fate. <br/>
The days when he swung a battle ax and devoted everything to<br/>
the Demon King. <br/>
And the decisive battle with the Hero. <br/>
With his memory of running through like a racehorse, a<br/>
torrent of information like an avalanche hits Ice Rock. <br/>
 <br/>
"Fremine, I want to ask something ..." <br/>
 <br/>
"Ah? What?" <br/>
 <br/>
"... What happened to our ambitions?" <br/>
 <br/>
"Huh? Why you ask such a thing..." <br/>
 <br/>
Ice Rock can't forget the worries that he should have<br/>
already wiped away, irresistibly, he asked. <br/>
His last moment. Ice Rock remembered he participated in the<br/>
battle to decide the world's fate. <br/>
He tried to block the deadly technique that blows off his<br/>
whole body. The enemy blade has penetrated his heart. <br/>
He fell down. In a blurred consciousness, he watched the<br/>
Demon King and the Hero confront each other. <br/>
 <br/>
However, after that, his memories are vague. <br/>
Ice Rock thought that he was destroyed at that moment, but<br/>
as long as he has a vague memory, he is a little unconvinced of the<br/>
answer. <br/>
Then, did they summoned to this world before the conclusion<br/>
battle with the Hero finished? <br/>
 <br/>
...... He felt something was different. <br/>
Because when he was dying and starting to lose<br/>
consciousness, he saw the Hero's sword stuck in the Demon Lord's body... <br/>
 <br/>
So Ice Rock shamelessly ask Fremine. <br/>
Fremine is a cunning and sly person, <br/>
While understanding that Fremine is planning to overtake the<br/>
other four heavenly kings and become the Demon King aide. <br/>
He chose to borrow that wisdom. <br/>
He hopes that the questions in his heart that similar to the<br/>
impatience feeling can be solved. <br/>
 <br/>
But... <br/>
 <br/>
 <br/>
“Keh!<br/>
　<br/>
It doesn't matter! We'll have to take the prey in front of<br/>
us now!<br/>
　<br/>
Isn't<br/>
that right, Ice Rock?" <br/>
 <br/>
“...... That’s right.” <br/>
 <br/>
The response from Fremine was not what he was<br/>
expecting. <br/>
No, Fremine was pretending to think a little. <br/>
Perhaps he is in the same situation as himself. <br/>
The area suddenly became noisy. <br/>
The bloodlust and excitement of the demons have come to an<br/>
uncontrollable point.  <br/>
The unreasonable growls and strange voices fill the<br/>
area, <br/>
They couldn't afford to have a leisurely conversation anymore. <br/>
He didn't get the answer to the question that springs up in<br/>
his head. Ice Rock senses that the time has come. <br/>
 <br/>
"Move the monster. First of all, destroy the Dragon<br/>
Town. Offer humans despair and suffering to the Demon Lord." <br/>
 <br/>
　<br/>
The second-in-command who was waiting at his side - a demon<br/>
dressed in a robe and holding a staff - nodded respectfully. <br/>
　<br/>
That demon draws letters in the air with some kind of<br/>
magic. <br/>
　<br/>
At the same time, the demons, who were mostly unintelligent,<br/>
began to slowly move forward. <br/>
 <br/>
"What you will do, Fremine?" <br/>
 <br/>
"Oh, I'll refrain. I'll give the lead to you. Be<br/>
grateful, Ice Rock!!" <br/>
 <br/>
"I see. Thanks." <br/>
 <br/>
　<br/>
He took out a giant battle-ax from his back and held it up<br/>
with both hands. <br/>
　<br/>
The weapon that has slaughtered many enemies is his<br/>
pride. <br/>
　<br/>
Except for the Hero, no one ever survived when standing<br/>
before his battle-ax. <br/>
　<br/>
Ice Rock takes a step forward. <br/>
　<br/>
The earth shakes, and the ground sinks because it can't hold<br/>
the weight coming from his massive body. <br/>
 <br/>
　<br/>
He marches into the city of Dragon Town, feeling Fremine<br/>
gaze behind him. <br/>
　<br/>
Fremine is not to be trusted. Ice Rock doesn't understand<br/>
what he's thinking, either.  <br/>
　<br/>
But it's inevitable. <br/>
　<br/>
All that matters is that the world is finally will be in the<br/>
Demon King hand. <br/>
　<br/>
And Ice Rock has the power to make this happen. <br/>
　<br/>
He'll destroy everyone. <br/>
　<br/>
The arrogance and short-sightedness of Shitennou of the<br/>
Demon King's Army lead Ice Rock to this decision. <br/>
 <br/>
  <br/>
 ……… <br/>
  <br/>
 …… <br/>
… <br/>
 <br/>
 <br/>
While seeing off the ice rocks and monsters marching into<br/>
the city, Fremine spit on a terribly dull view. <br/>
However, that expression immediately changes. A bird-like<br/>
monster wrapped in flames landed on the Fremine side and made a report. <br/>
 <br/>
　<br/>
Fremine turns his gaze to the northwest with a grin and a<br/>
twisted expression. <br/>
　<br/>
He is selfish, ignores orders, and cruel. <br/>
　<br/>
If Ice Rock's character is a warrior, then Fremine's<br/>
character can be described as a poisonous snake. <br/>
Fremine says something to the demon who just reported something<br/>
to him. <br/>
The bird-shaped monster that received the command of the<br/>
Lord flew immediately to faithfully carry out its duties. <br/>
Shitennou of flame giggled while keeping his eyes on a<br/>
certain point. <br/>
From his cruel smile, there is no doubt that he is an<br/>
absolute terrible person. It belongs to a destroyer who will dominate the<br/>
living things in the future. <br/>
 <br/>
"Hihihi! I wonder... should I go and take over the<br/>
other town!" <br/>
 <br/>
 <br/>
