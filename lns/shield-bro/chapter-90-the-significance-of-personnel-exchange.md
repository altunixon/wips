You’ll want to read this again since there are a lot of things that have been clarified. It was indeed a tough chapter, and not one you can really do with just MT. Certain portions have therefore simply been re-translated. Enjoy.<br/>
<br/>
The day after.<br/>
Returning to the hotel yesterday, I entered the hot spring and took a rest.<br/>
Entering the Japanese-style hot spring that Shadow talked about, little by little, I feel the tension in my body seeping out.<br/>
Well, the Japanese and Chinese styles have kind of been mixed together…<br/>
Among other things, there’s a Kaminarimon1 with paper umbrellas… Various things like the paper sliding doors have a kind of Chinese look to them. It feels like a foreigner’s attempt at imitating a Japanese bath.2<br/>
I have no complaints though, I’m just anxious to find out what kind of country the East is. That goes regardless of whether they are nice or not.<br/>
Naofumi: "Well then, I’m off."<br/>
Raphtalia: "Please take care of yourself."<br/>
Naofumi: "I think it was Ren today… Make sure the plan doesn’t turn into a repeat of Motoyasu’s."<br/>
After all, I cannot deny the possibility of him being a closet lecher.<br/>
There are cases where those who act cool will turn around and chase after girls.<br/>
A bastard that won’t help, but will if it’s a woman.<br/>
How should I put it, I really don’t know anything about that guy. Just that… when he was responsible for someone else getting hurt, he obediently listened to the story.<br/>
All I can say is, Ren seems like a cool adolescent male who styles himself as an ally of justice.<br/>
Raphtalia: "Right."<br/>
Firo: "Have a nice day~"<br/>
–<br/>
On the way to the room where Ren’s companions are.<br/>
Naofumi: "…this is so unproductive."<br/>
I voice my dissatisfaction about the staff exchange to Shadow.<br/>
I understand the queen’s idea behind it, but the stress isn’t diminishing.<br/>
Shadow: "I see degojaruna. You’re wondering why the queen suggested the staff exchange degojaruka. Because there have been no problems in the past, I was fine with this too degojaruga."<br/>
Naofumi: "You… having following the queen’s orders for so long don’t understand. Ah well, I’ve also thought about the various things that led to this agreement."<br/>
Shadow: "What things degojaru?"<br/>
Naofumi: "Aren’t you guys covering for contingencies instead of the information you collect behind the scenes?"<br/>
Shadow: "Well grasped degojaruna."<br/>
Naofumi: "Because it’s that queen behind it, it’s a natural thought."<br/>
There is a limit to observations from outside sources.<br/>
Naofumi: "I’m sure you received information about the actions taken by the other heroes. But you wouldn’t be able to come up with an explanation for Raphtalia’s physical changes."<br/>
It’s difficult to sort out what’s real from the huge pile of miscellaneous information.<br/>
Naofumi: "Let’s assume you manage to collect information on the heroes. You guys are still forgetting something very important. How are you supposed to understand the secret to a hero’s strength?"<br/>
These weapons can absorb any materials from anywhere!<br/>
I mean, is it possible to understand the difference between mine and the other’s strength?<br/>
There are multiple shadows I assume, so it won’t necessarily always be the same one watching. The result is that intelligence gathering becomes messy.<br/>
If the contents of the investigation are written down in a letter, the meaning conveyed in a voice would also be lost.<br/>
It’s something that cannot be understood by someone who doesn’t hold a hero’s weapon. Hearing about it during the information exchange would be useless too. Considering those guys’ habit of hiding themselves, it is also likely they would hold back and tell lies.<br/>
I can’t help it, it’s special! They might hide it with that kind of reasoning.<br/>
As it is, they will not talk easily, so it’s only possible to examine closely for ourselves.<br/>
Shadow: "It can’t be helped degojaru. This was done exclusively for Hero of the Shield-dono, I also haven’t worked very long together with Hero of the Shield-dono degojaruyue."<br/>
Naofumi: "Ah, it can’t be helped. If this could be finished in a day, it wouldn’t be so difficult."<br/>
Besides… and this is important, the companions of each hero will be easily dyed with that one’s standard of values.<br/>
In reality, Raphtalia objects against Motoyasu’s policies. If I’m right, Motoyasu’s companions too feel the same way about me.<br/>
However, if a personnel exchange is carried out, then our perspectives should broaden a little.<br/>
It also provides a chance for those used to the princess treatment to experience battles with the other heroes.<br/>
Bitch’s situation is not worth mentioning, but Woman 1 managed to broaden her view by staying cool and resolving herself, and Woman 2 just looks at me like I’m an abnormal hero. However, when they fight together with Ren and Itsuki, they should more or less understand.<br/>
It seems that for those fighting alongside Bitch as a companion… it’s a situation of divide and conquer.<br/>
With that, I’ll stop complaining.<br/>
Naofumi: "If only I could watch what the other heroes pull out when their companions fall into a crisis."<br/>
Shadow: "A crisis degojaruka? Being together with a Hero-dono, I would think means always being side-by-side with danger degojaruga."<br/>
Naofumi: "It’s the opposite. The whole world knows heroes are at the top. In short, do not approach enemies stronger than yourself."<br/>
Shadow: "I see… there’s that kind of thinking too degojaruka."<br/>
Their levels are usually rising steadily, so it’s most likely their crisis opportunities are lacking.<br/>
They’re following heroes who feel like they’re in a game. When you only fight enemies that you can beat, your sense of urgency goes away.<br/>
It would be easy to fall under the illusion that they themselves are part of the privileged class.<br/>
Just by announcing that they are a hero’s companion, they will receive preferential treatment.<br/>
Of course, a hero is not perfect either, so there will be at least once or twice when it becomes truly dangerous.<br/>
Even if they survive by luck, I imagine they would still feel a release afterward together with the hero.<br/>
Because all three heroes have great confidence in themselves.<br/>
In the first place, when Motoyasu’s party ended up in a crisis like that, some companions involved fell out because of it.<br/>
Naofumi: "At the end, the companions might barely be able to understand how a hero is different having watched them every day. I imagine the difference would seem small. Besides, there is also cultivating friendships to be considered."<br/>
Shadow: "I understand degojaru. If anything riotous happens I’ll let you know degojaru."<br/>
Looking at Melromarc and the rest of the world’s standpoint, it’s normal they would try to make the heroes get along with each other.<br/>
Not mentioning the internal discord that led to the loss during the wave, they’re on bad terms even at the best of times.<br/>
I don’t really want to make friends, but I understand that co-operating is necessary.<br/>
If it was just us, we couldn’t have beat the pope.<br/>
From now on co-operation will be important. After this island event is over and we get dispatched to some foreign country, us acting together during the waves won’t change.<br/>
However, the opportunity to talk at that time is gone at once.<br/>
That’s fine by me, but… to fight against Glass and them, I can’t just say I’ll go do my own thing.<br/>
Even though I hate those guys, we belong to the same side so cooperation is necessary.<br/>
Come to think of it… how do we participate in the waves around the world?<br/>
Do the waves gather around Melromarc’s vicinity since that is where the heroes were summoned?<br/>
That’s something else I’ll have to discuss with the queen.<br/>
Perhaps, after the personnel exchange, I wonder if Shadow’s findings are going to be reported.<br/>
Or is the plan to stick to their habit of hiding things from the heroes?<br/>
If I have to say regarding the goal this time, the purpose is to develop mutual understanding with the companions of the other heroes.<br/>
The heroes are introduced to skillful people. And so, if they feel they’re lacking something, they’ll ask a trustworthy companion and so forth… right?<br/>
Those guys, they won’t ask because they think so highly of themselves. They’re too quick to think they got it.<br/>
Well, it could simply be about recruitment.<br/>
The bastard Motoyasu tried to solicit my companions using his own special way.<br/>
The possibility of Ren and Itsuki also soliciting is not zero. It’s actually rather high.<br/>
In their case though, they’d think about raising them from the bottom themselves…<br/>
Do demi-humans and demons get that strong? Well, that’s also the sense I have.<br/>
However, there is a big contradiction when it comes to this theory.<br/>
They are not expected to get strong. That means, the games those fellows played did not have any demi-humans or demons who become that strong… is what I imagine.<br/>
That or it was never tried.<br/>
Is this strength from improving themselves?<br/>
I don’t know.<br/>
How should I put it, I feel like the queen’s goal is to raise the standard of all the heroes.<br/>
There seems to be some intention to treat me favourably, but it will be awkward from the world-wide standpoint if the other heroes are seen as weak.<br/>
That it’s a planned compromise goes without saying.<br/>
Rather than only letting the shadows investigate, it’s more reliable if we check things out for ourselves.<br/>
Though neither one should be left out.<br/>
Looking at it, while this personnel exchange certainly seems useless, it might be a decoy in order to make collecting information easier.<br/>
Gathering the heroes in the pretext of the island being active.<br/>
…I’ve probably read too much into things already.<br/>
Even if I am over-interpreting though, I’m thinking about how Ren and Itsuki’s parties will act.<br/>
It won’t be troublesome if nothing happens, but there’ll be a big loss if anything does happens.<br/>
Shadow: "This is the room where the Hero of the Sword’s companions are staying degojaru."<br/>
While deep in thought, I finally arrived in front of the room where Ren’s companions are.<br/>
Naofumi: "Ahh."<br/>
I nod and knock on the door.<br/>
NPC: "Go ahead."<br/>
This time a proper reply comes. It’s a big difference from Motoyasu’s place.<br/>
I open the door and step inside.<br/>
NPC: "Welcome and thanks for coming. Hero of the Shield-sama."<br/>
Naofumi: "Oh, yeah…"<br/>
Because of my experience last time, it is somewhat anticlimactic.<br/>
Well then… Ren’s companions number four people.<br/>
That’s one more than Motoyasu. There were five in the beginning though, so it’s gone down by one.<br/>
It’s also reasonable to assume that some members were replaced.<br/>
Naofumi: "Though I’m sure you already know, you’ll be working together with me, the Hero of the Shield, for the staff exchange today and tomorrow. The name is Iwatanai Naofumi."<br/>
I recognize three people from when we started, and the last one was added I guess?<br/>
NPC: "I look forward to working with you, Hero of the Shield-sama."<br/>
Naofumi: "Yeah."<br/>
All the members are polite.<br/>
But these guys… at that time, they showed me distain and hid behind Ren.3<br/>
I won’t forget that.<br/>
I can’t be careless and let my guard down.<br/>
Representative: "Apologies for back then."<br/>
Naofumi: "Huh?"<br/>
A man who looks the representative… a warrior I guess? He bows to me.4<br/>
Representative: "Please understand, because of the situation with the King of Melromark, we knew that anyone siding with the Hero of the Shield would be put down a lot."<br/>
The others lowered their head to match the representative.<br/>
Representative: "Though you might feel those words mean little, for the next two days we ask you to please instruct us well."<br/>
Naofumi: "U-Understood."<br/>
Somehow… when the other person is strangely polite, it’s unnerving.<br/>
My experiences until now make me suspicious that something may be going on behind the scenes.<br/>
Representative: "Shall we leave immediately?"<br/>
Naofumi: "Yeah, lets."<br/>
It’s still too early to say one way or the other.<br/>
What happened was with Motoyasu’s party after all. A voice then quickly cuts into my thoughts.<br/>
Magician: "So, where would be a good place for us to go raise our levels?"<br/>
A magician-like fellow at the back asks me in a natural manner.<br/>
Naofumi: "…eh?"<br/>
