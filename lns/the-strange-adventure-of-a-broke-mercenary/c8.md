“Guess I’m not getting out of this easily!”<br/>
There was nowhere to run, being pincered in by the two groups.<br/>
As Loren decided that the only way out was to cut through them, he heard Oxy finish chanting her spell.<br/>
“Scatter the sands, bring upon slumber! <<Sleep>>”<br/>
Based on Oxy’s movements and line of sight, Loren saw that she was using on the goblins in front and was irritated at her decision.<br/>
He knew that she was trying to help Sarfe and Naron, but if they were to successfully retreat, it was better to use it on the goblins behind them.<br/>
But Oxy was too focused on them and didn’t seem like she noticed the goblins behind them.<br/>
Loren changed his mind and thought that they still had a chance if they could at least get through the goblins in front, and waited for Oxy’s spell to take effect. But he narrowed his eyes, seeing a strange light coming from the goblin mage’s necklace.<br/>
At the same time for an unknown reason, Lapis, who Loren was still holding her by the collar, became limp.<br/>
As her knees buckled, Loren immediately let go of her and before her knees could hit the floor, he managed to catch her and lend her his shoulder.<br/>
“Hey! What’s wrong?”<br/>
“This is…”<br/>
He didn’t have time to check what was wrong with Lapis, who looked dumbfounded, because he heard Oxy’s panicked voice.<br/>
“What? How!?”<br/>
Loren soon found out why.<br/>
Although the spell had been used, there was no sign of any of the goblins going to sleep. The goblins then rushed at Sarfe and Naron at once.<br/>
“You bastards! Get away from me!”<br/>
“S…stop! Let go of me!”<br/>
There was no way Sarfe could get up and fight with an injured shoulder and leg.<br/>
Naron, who injured her flank, was unable to go against them either and they pushed her to the ground.<br/>
“Hey! Get away from her!”<br/>
The goblins showed no mercy, bringing their weapons down on Sarfe.<br/>
As dull swords chipped away at his flesh and the clubs struck bone after bone, Sarfe screamed in pain.<br/>
Naron shrieked as the goblins started to rip her clothes off.<br/>
Oxy became pale at the sight and before she could do anything, the goblins tackled her from behind and covered her, not even letting her scream.<br/>
Loren knew that he couldn’t save them.<br/>
He then started to take steps forward.<br/>
For a second,the thought of leaving Lapis here crossed his mind.<br/>
Lapis couldn’t move her limbs, much less grab onto Loren’s shoulder, and was getting carried by Loren. To him, she was dead weight.<br/>
If he left her, he would be able to move around quicker and the goblins would be focused on new prey, letting him run away with little to no problems.<br/>
The only problem was dealing with the guilt later, but considering the pros, he thought it wasn’t a bad choice.<br/>
Lapis looked up at Loren, who was still trying to decide, and gave out a small sigh.<br/>
“It can’t be helped, just leave me.”<br/>
It was a completely different tone than until now.<br/>
Loren was more surprised that she told him to leave her here than the change in the way she talked.<br/>
“I’m in the way, correct? They won’t kill a woman that easily, but they will kill you for sure. Don’t mind me and just go.”<br/>
He sensed a feeling of defeat in her voice.<br/>
But what struck his heart was that she was saying all this just for him.<br/>
So what Loren did was silently grip the sword in his left hand tighter and put Lapis under his right arm.<br/>
“Hey?”<br/>
“Shut up, you might bite your tongue.”<br/>
After getting a better grip on her, he gritted his teeth and took a step forward, then suddenly started dashing toward the exit.<br/>
All the screaming from behind him and weird moaning sounds coming from Lapis didn’t reach his ears anymore.<br/>
He swung his left arm in a wide arc right at the base of a goblin’s neck.<br/>
The goblin’s body tore into two pieces and Loren kicked them away, then bashed the forehead of another goblin who jumped at him.<br/>
The blade lodged into its head and broke off.<br/>
Loren, as soon as he felt it break, hurled the rest of the sword at another goblin, then picked up a club and continued to speed up.<br/>
He rushed past Sarfe, who was getting hacked to pieces in a pool of blood, and Naron, who was stripped naked and held down on the ground, and went straight toward the archers.<br/>
A few arrows were fired at close range.<br/>
No matter how bad they were at using bows, Loren was close enough that it was almost impossible to miss.<br/>
But to the goblins’ surprise, not even one of them managed to hit Loren, and before they could even act confused, they got a knee to the face and flew away.<br/>
Right before the arrows were launched, Loren immediately jumped to the side and as soon as the arrows flew past, he jumped and kicked off the wall, propelling himself towards the goblins and landed the attack.<br/>
He didn’t even bother looking at his work as continued running, at a speed that seemed impossible to reach while holding a person.<br/>
He dashed toward the goblin mage, who was standing behind more archers.<br/>
But the goblin mage wasn’t ready to back down without a fight.<br/>
It started muttering something and raised a finger and pointed it at Loren. A ball of fire appeared at the tip and started moving in Loren’s direction.<br/>
It was the beginner level magic spell , and it flew at him faster than the arrows.<br/>
Loren couldn’t dodge in time and it struck him on the left shoulder.<br/>
<br/>
Loren grimaced at the impact and the pain of fire burning his flesh, but it wasn’t enough to slow him at all.<br/>
The goblin mage, shocked that the spell didn’t stop Loren, was readying another spell.<br/>
“Too slow!”<br/>
Of course, Loren wasn’t about to give it time to use another spell.<br/>
Cutting off the pain in his left arm from his consciousness, he rammed into the goblin mage.<br/>
He took a wide swing at it and the hit immediately crushed its head open.<br/>
At the same time, he threw away the now broken club, and before the goblin mage could fall onto the ground, reached out and snatched the necklace that emitted the strange light when Oxy used her spell.<br/>
“I wish you would just leave that.”<br/>
Lapis muttered in a small voice, looking at the necklace with the corner of her eye, but Loren ignored her and jumped into the tunnel in front of them.<br/>
It was the other way they came from, but they didn’t have a choice.<br/>
There was a chance that the tunnel led to a smaller space, but there were side tunnels and Loren prayed that they could use them to dodge the goblins and escape.<br/>
“How are you running so well without any light?”<br/>
Lapis asked him, sounding impressed.<br/>
Her tone was a lot more relaxed, but lacked the politeness that Lapis’ usual way of talking had and Loren wondered if she was putting on airs until now, but he didn’t answer her and continued to run.<br/>
“Don’t tell me you can see in the dark?”<br/>
“Shut up, you’re loud. I can’t focus.”<br/>
There was no way Loren could see where he was going in the dark tunnel.<br/>
But back when he was a mercenary, he learned how to figure out his surroundings by using the reflections of sounds that he made.<br/>
It was a technique mostly used during times where they couldn’t use a light, such as during an ambush, and although it helped, it wasn’t the most accurate. If he lost focus there was a chance of tripping over uneven ground or crashing into a wall, so he didn’t have any time to spare talking to Lapis.<br/>
“Getting carried around like a sack gets pretty boring.”<br/>
“I don’t have time for that. It’s a matter of life and death so please be quiet.”<br/>
“That’s true, but how about this.”<br/>
As soon as Lapis said that a soft white light shined, illuminating their surroundings.<br/>
Loren squinted and realized that the light was coming from his chest and guessed that Lapis had something to do with it. He slowed down slightly and looked down at the girl.<br/>
“Can you see now? I won’t ask you to carry me like a princess, but can you at least carry me on your back?”<br/>
Lapis asked him with her limbs still dangling.<br/>
He could’ve ignored her, but he felt an eerie tone from her voice and gently let her down from under her arm and proceeded to put her on his back.<br/>
“Ah, that’s better. Now that that’s out of the way, Loren, thank you for saving me back there.”<br/>
As soon as she got on his back, she started talking politely again.<br/>
Loren wondered what the change in her way of talking meant as he continued deeper into the tunnel, now illuminated by the light.<br/>
“But why did you decide to save me? You left everyone else to die back there.”<br/>
Loren didn’t flinch at the fact that she said he left Sarfe and the rest to die.<br/>
He knew that she was simply just asking him what she was thinking, so he answered her in a daunting manner.<br/>
“I just felt like it. You were lucky. I still owe you money. Just choose one. I’m sure one of them is the answer.”<br/>
<br/>
“Is it okay if I take it that Loren is a kind person?”<br/>
“If that were true I wouldn’t have left the others.”<br/>
He told Lapis with a wry smile and a teasing tone, but she didn’t seem to be offended at all and quietly leaned onto his back.<br/>
“But you still saved me so I’ll think of it as that.”<br/>
“Think of it as you want to then.”<br/>
It didn’t matter to Loren about how Lapis thought about him.<br/>
When Loren told her to do as she liked, she told him she would with a smile on her face.<br/>

Hey guys Kaoto here!<br/>
FINALLY!<br/>
THEY ARE GONE!<br/>
Can we get a round of applause for the goblins for doing such a great job?<br/>
Probably the most satisfying chapter I’ll translate for a while 🙂<br/>
Okay on to some other stuff.<br/>
About Lapis changing the way she talks.<br/>
It was pretty hard for me to get it right, and honestly I’m not sure if what i wrote even sounds any different.<br/>
I might just italicize the parts where it changes or something.<br/>
If you guys have any ideas let me know, ok?<br/>
For some reason Novel Updates hasn’t updated Chapter 7 so hopefully they do that soon because I think that’s why a lot of people haven’t read it yet.<br/>
I believe that this is around a third through Arc 1, and (even though it’s only like, 8 chapters) I want to thank all of you guys for reading and commenting as well as bearing with me until now.<br/>
Personally I want to translate the whole series for you guys, and hopefully I can.<br/>
This is the first time I’m translating a light novel, and honestly it isn’t as easy as I first thought it would be.<br/>
But I really want to give you guys quality translations so that you guys could read this series that I love so much.<br/>
I would appreciate it if you guys could continue to support me and Slime, wherever we may end up.<br/>
Again, thanks a lot guys and I’ll see you in the next chapter!<br/>
Aww, don’t cry, Slime. Everyone loves you. I won’t throw you away either (as long as you edit and upload my stuff 🙂 ) Here, blow you nose. Oh wait. I forgot you explode when you sneeze…Crap now I have to mop all of this up…<br/>
