Chapter 62.3 : Rondo of Light and Darkness<br/>
MVP of This ACT : Let’s give applause to Rena for being “subtle”.<br/>
===<br/>
When the light finally receded, Zarxis, Diadone, Labrys, and the Roc had long since vanished.<br/>
「What was just now?」<br/>
「That’s Diadona’s petrification gaze, Kuroki. Not even a member of the Divine race can withstand that gaze. That aside…」<br/>
Rena looked out towards the direction of where the Roc had been as she spoke.<br/>
「They managed to get away huh… Never expected that Diadona will come out of nowhere in this place.」<br/>
Rena showed a gloomy look on her face.<br/>
But it couldn’t be helped now. They’d already gone this far.<br/>
「Cheer up, Rena. Labrys’ plan has failed and he will not disturb you anymore. Victory is yours. That’s why you should smile and enjoy this victory, at least for now.」<br/>
Rena’s lips bloomed into a sweet smile when I told her so.<br/>
「You’re right… I should be happy. That’s why, please protect me if they appear again, okay.」<br/>
Rena’s face leaned in so close to mine as she spoke those words.<br/>
「Errr, that’s…」<br/>
I became extremely flustered at seeing her beautiful face so close up.<br/>
Meanwhile, Rena was smiling happily, clearly enjoying my reaction.<br/>
「Well then, it’s about time for me to go down and look at those children. I’ve to meet Reiji no matter what. See you later, Kuroki.」<br/>
Rena descended from her ship after saying her farewell.<br/>
As I looked down, I saw the scene of Reiji being surrounded by so many girls. Reiji was smiling in the middle of the group of girls that were surrounding him.<br/>
They were celebrating this reunion.<br/>
Naturally, Shirone was amongst those girls.<br/>
Shirone embraced her comrades too. She looked really happy at their reunion.<br/>
I gave my blessings upon seeing that.<br/>
Her happiness was what I wanted in the end, after all.<br/>
Shirone might not get enough attention since there were so many beauties around Reiji, but it was the path she’d chosen on her own. All I could do was pray for her happiness. Most of all, I didn’t want to have a quarrel with Shirone over this matter again.<br/>
Rena arrived at their group a moment later.<br/>
The girls opened a path for Rena upon seeing her arrival.<br/>
As soon as she approached, Reiji took Rena’s hand in his own.<br/>
When they were standing together like that, the scene was picturesque like that of a match made in heaven. I couldn’t help but feel jealous upon seeing a scene like that.<br/>
After getting his hands on Shirone and the other beauties, he’d also gotten the beautiful Goddess Rena.<br/>
I couldn’t help but feel sad at seeing this scene.<br/>
「Uuh… Let’s stop this… Seeing more than this will only make me feeling more miserable inside.」<br/>
I activated a flying spell as I muttered those words to myself.<br/>
I couldn’t help but be jealous of Reiji.<br/>
But, I also know that I should be chasing after my own happiness.<br/>
I started flying towards Nargol’s direction.<br/>
Wait for me, Kuna.<br/>
I flew alone under the lonely dusk sky.<br/>
===<br/>
◆Black Haired Sage; Chiyuki<br/>
「Chiyuki-san, what is the thing that was shining just now!?」<br/>
Nao asked with a loud voice.<br/>
「I don’t know… maybe it’s some sort of magic but…」<br/>
The snake woman had suddenly cast brilliant light as soon as she appeared and Labrys’ figure had vanished as soon as the light receded.<br/>
It seems that they’d retreated.<br/>
「Look! The angels are…」<br/>
When I turned around to look at the direction Rino was pointing at, I saw the angels becoming transparent, as though they were sculpted from gems.<br/>
「Petrification curse… they’re still alive. But we’ve to restore them later…」<br/>
Upon a closer look, the angels really were turned into gems.<br/>
Though it wasn’t a deadly curse, the petrification curse was still powerful. There should be a way to turn them back still though.<br/>
「But, that curse is so terrifyingly powerful. To think that it’s still this powerful even with Rena’s protection…」<br/>
I shuddered in fear.<br/>
I seems Rena had activated her defensive spells before that snake woman used her demon eyes. I still remember being protected by the pale blue dome at that time.<br/>
Though we were protected from the effects of the curse, the angels, who had less magic resistance compared to us, were still petrified.<br/>
But it was a normal petrification curse that would turn the target into stone. In this case, the target was turned into gem.<br/>
The petrified angels looked as though they were sculpted from emeralds. They might still be alive, but turning them back was going to be a great deal of problem.<br/>
「We’ve to fight against that kind of opponent huh…」<br/>
Nao spoke with a weary look on her face.<br/>
I also wanted to be spared from fighting against a monster like that.<br/>
Everyone’s expression turned gloomy.<br/>
「Geez, stop spitting such disheartening words already!! Look, at least everyone is save right now!!!」<br/>
Shirone embraced me when I declared loudly.<br/>
「Shirone…」<br/>
「Thanks you for being safe!!!」<br/>
Shirone’s face was messed up due to her endlessly flowing tears. It seems that she’d been extremely worried about us.<br/>
「Ah, sorry Shirone… I’ve made you worry so much.」<br/>
Everyone was smiling when the di*ck head said so with a smile on his face.<br/>
「Most of all, you’re safe and sound, Reiji.」<br/>
Rena was walking towards us.<br/>
「RENA!!!」<br/>
Reiji quickly went over towards Rena too.<br/>
「My bad, Rena!! I’ve made you worry so much!!」<br/>
Reiji took Rena’s hand while apologizing to her.<br/>
「I know that you’ll be okay. But still, I can’t help but to worry, Reiji. I always think that something bad might happen to him…」<br/>
Rena spoke with a sorrowful look on her face.<br/>
I felt that something was off about what Rena had said just now.<br/>
I mean, she should’ve said 「Something bad might happen to you」in that kind of situation, right?<br/>
But it seems that it was a trivial matter for Reiji since he didn’t notice nor care about it. On the contrary, Reiji looked like he was deeply moved by Rena’s speech just now.<br/>
「My bad, Rena!! But, no need to worry anymore!!」<br/>
When Reiji was about to embrace Rena, she suddenly dodged his arms from wrapping around her.<br/>
「Reiji… It’s true that I’m glad upon seeing you safe and sound but, you’ve to calm down for now. That’s why, let’s meet again later on.」<br/>
Rena looked seriously at the petrified angels as she spoke.<br/>
It wasn’t like all of them were turned into sculpted gems. Some were safe, while others were partially petrified.<br/>
Rena ordered the angels who were safe and sound to carry their petrified and half-petrified comrades back to her ship before returning to Elios. Rena and co. left us behind to return.<br/>
「Let’s go back to the Republic of Ariadya, Reiji-kun.」<br/>
「 Yeah.」<br/>
Euria had moved to the Republic of Ariadya before our expedition in Labrys’ labyrinth. That’s why all of us were returning there.<br/>
According to Shirone, both Kyouka and Kaya should’ve been waiting for us at the Republic of Ariadya as well.<br/>
「Come to think of it… Kuroki?」<br/>
Shirone surveyed the surroundings.<br/>
There was no one but us left in this place.<br/>
「Come to think of it, where did he go, Shirone? You should’ve managed to take him back from Nargol, right?」<br/>
I was also looking to spot his figure. I had yet to thank him for saving my life.<br/>
But Shirone shook her head upon hearing my question.<br/>
「Uurhm… not yet… he might already be on the way back to Nargol…」<br/>
Shirone was already on the verge of crying again.<br/>
「Let me hear the details later after we arrive in the Republic of Ariadya. Kyouka-san and co have been waiting for us there, right?」<br/>
There were so many things to ask Shirone regarding what happened to her when we weren’t around. In addition, I wanted to know more about him too.<br/>
I recalled the matter of Shirone’s childhood friend, Kuroki, again as I recited the chant for the teleportation spell.<br/>
