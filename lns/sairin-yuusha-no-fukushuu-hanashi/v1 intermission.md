Several days after “Hero” Amatsuki Iori escaped.<br/>
The Onriin Kingdom.<br/>
In the imperial palace enshrined at the centre of Bureion castle town, it was still dealing with post-treatment hastily.<br/>
In addition to the Hero escaping, he had also stolen the magic stones, along with the national treasure.<br/>
Furthermore, the unit which had chased after the hero was exterminated completely with  just one person surviving.<br/>
With an investigation about Labyrinth of Hades that ceased functioning, there’s a lot of things to deal with.<br/>
As such,in the royal palace, Luser Gilban, who survived after getting treatment had been summoned for an audience with the king.<br/>
With Luser’s body, that wasn’t well-balanced anymore after losing his right arm, he set foot into the throne room with uncertain steps.<br/>
It was attended by the aristocrats/nobles whose aim is the downfall of Luser.<br/>
How did the Hero escape?<br/>
How was the door of the treasure storage opened?<br/>
How was the chasing unit annihilated?<br/>
Luser answered those questions solemnly.<br/>
Even if he had to answer those questions, there’s a report that he needed to hide entirely for his own convenience.<br/>
Still, for the unconvinced aristocrats that raised a clamour, Luser just directed his gaze towards the king.<br/>
「 How will you take responsibility for this blunder? 」(King)<br/>
As the King that sat in the deepest part of the throne room, Gransill Kreuz Onriin, raised his voice seriously to control those aristocrats that were raising their clamour.<br/>
「  To arrest the Hero  ー leave it to me   」(Luser)<br/>
Is said by Luser after fixing his gaze directly to the king.<br/>
Losing the Hero and the desertion of Lucifina, who was the strongest knight thirty years ago.<br/>
Since that, the Kingdom’s war potential has gone down substantially as its national strength fell.<br/>
As talented people, such as Luser and Lucifina, have yet to appear since then.<br/>
ー  No one other than me is capable of arresting that guy, but?<br/>
On the connotation as Luser spoke to the king.<br/>
After a brief silence, the king said.<br/>
「……Luser Gilban, you will be under house arrest for ten days and have to<br/>
arrest the Hero without fail after the house arrest is over.<br/>
If there isn’t any intention of returning it’s fine to kill him.<br/>
Rather than the existence of the Hero being exposed to the foreign country it’s better to deal with it fast 」(King)<br/>
「 HA~  」(Luser)<br/>
As Luser replied vigorously before he left the throne room.<br/>
「 Your Majesty, why didn’t you punish Luser!?」<br/>
After he left, the noble who stayed protested to the king.<br/>
Though he committed such a blunder, why is there no action against him? *T/N it can read as * Although he made a mistake, why did you not punish him.<br/>
「 Although he grew old, he was a man equal to the Hero once.<br/>
When judging, the criticism from peoples should be avoided.<br/>
When it comes to that, are you capable of handling such a problem?  」(King)<br/>
「…………」<br/>
The aristocrat couldn’t answer the king words.<br/>
「 Everyone, that is present here,understands.<br/>
A man, like him, is necessary for the Kingdom right now  」(King)<br/>
It’s a fact that Luser’s existence was something irreplaceable for the Kingdom itself.<br/>
The aristocrats were dismissed as they couldn’t deny it.<br/>
◆<br/>
「 Damn. Damn! Amatsu. Amatsu! Amatsu……!! 」(Luser)<br/>
As Luser who returned to his atelier burst out his suppressed anger.<br/>
Hit the desk with his full force as the equipment lined out on the desk scattered.<br/>
Blood dripped from his fist, it couldn’t be helped, as it was caused by his hatred.<br/>
All of it was Amatsuki Iori fault.(Ed2 note: Right…who started the revenge cycle again?)<br/>
「 Hah, to arrest? Of course, I’ll KILL HIM!  」(Luser)<br/>
It can’t be helped that his mouth keeps spouting curses unstoppably.<br/>
「I   won’t forgive that woman either! 」(Luser)<br/>
To claim to not know about Luser Gilban, who was the kingdom strongest mage?<br/>
Even a joke has its limits.<br/>
AmatsuAmatsuAmatsuAmatsu as always.<br/>
It was something unacceptable for him.<br/>
「  I’ve remembered your face<br/>
and your magical power as well.<br/>
I won’t let you get away.<br/>
Next time I’ll be going all out . 」(Luser)<br/>
First, being caught off guard.<br/>
Secondly, not enough preparations.<br/>
And thirdly, I’ll take all possible measures and crush him.<br/>
「  What about “Revenge”.<br/>
It’s me who will get revenge.<br/>
It’s me who will be the one to make you be sorry, I will kill you……!! 」(Luser)<br/>
—That expression of looking down on me.—<br/>
Luser let out a laugh as he imagined how they will beg for their lives while crying as their faces distorted by pain and regret.<br/>
Regret?<br/>
Apologize?<br/>
I’ll kill you?<br/>
Those were all my lines.<br/>
「 Judging from the location, they will be headed towards the allied country, right?<br/>
KUKU, I should make my move. 」(Luser)<br/>
Wherever they are, I won’t let them slip away.<br/>
Luser began his preparations to kill Iori with an ugly smile on his face.<br/>
