Epilogue<br/>
Five days later— the fifth of the Grey month.<br/>
Grey month, another strange name. The previous month was white, and the next would be black. And so, this month was grey.<br/>
Anyway, it was the fifth of the Grey month. Ai Fa and I finally received permission to return to the Fa house. Through the efforts of Malfreed and the others, most of the bandits of the "Tempest of Death" were apprehended.<br/>
The traitors of the Townsguard also confessed their crimes after Pyschkurewuss sold them out. Pyschkurewuss’ condition had finally improved, and he was handed over to the Genos City authorities. The trial will finally begin tomorrow. Marstein already gave his word to the tribal chiefs of Forest’s Edge, Pyschkurewuss would either be sentenced to life imprisonment or death.<br/>
After that trial, Zuro Tsun and Barcia would have to stand trial next. It had already been decided that Zuro Tsun would serve ten years of hard labor, and Barcia would be pardoned.<br/>
It would take some time before everything gets resolved— but we could finally go back to our normal daily lives.<br/>
"Ara, this is so nostalgic that I’m about to cry."<br/>
I said as I prepared dinner in the Fa house’s kitchen. Ai Fa who just returned from her hunt sat down with her legs crossed a short distance away.<br/>
I was abducted by Lifuria on the fifth of the White Month. So it had been a month since then. I did make trips back in between, but Ai Fa and I would spend the night in the Wu clan— I couldn’t suppress the emotions in my heart.<br/>
And of course, Ai Fa came back to tidy the food store every day, so it probably looked the same to her. During the day, people from the Fou, Sidora and Dean house would visit from time to time, so I had a comfortable time in the Wu clan. However, the Fa house was still the place that I call home.<br/>
"The stall will finally reopen tomorrow. The trial isn’t over yet so we can’t be careless, but we can finally revert back to our usual daily lives."<br/>
The castle guards, Kamyua Yost and the others would escort our stalls. All the criminals should have been apprehended, but Marstein advised that escorts were still necessary before the conclusion of the trial.<br/>
"The guards will watch from afar, while Zashuma and me will accompany you to the inns. Asuta, you can work with ease."<br/>
That was what Kamyua Yost said.<br/>
After the trial ends, Kamyua Yost plans to leave Genos for some time.<br/>
"After escorting Sir Wellhyde back to Banam, I will look for a job there, and then tour around the western kingdom. This entire affair took three months of my time, so I want to travel for a bit."<br/>
Kamyua Yost’s words concluded this incident. This wanderer with purple eyes had a smile that put me at ease as he continued:<br/>
"The next big task would be to sculpt the image that the Forest’s Edge denizens want to present to the people of Genos. The fate of Pyschkurewuss, Shileru, Zattsu Tsun and others had finally been righted. I plan to think about how everyone in Genos would be like when I visit again as I tour around the country."<br/>
Kamyua Yost was right.<br/>
All the misunderstanding had been slowly resolved. The grudges between the Genos nobles and Forest’s Edge denizens were being slowly cleared, and all the wrongdoing exposed. Hence, now was the crucial moment.<br/>
After putting the criminals to task, the Forest’s Edge denizens were still a small conservative tribe with customs and values that differs from the townsfolk. How would the relationship between the Forest’s Edge denizens and Genos citizens develop— after eight decades, this problem took center stage once again.<br/>
However, the things I could do was limited.<br/>
"All sorts of ingredients will be available in the Post Station Town. Hence, the quality of the dishes sold in the other stalls would improve too. In order to compete with them, I need to come up with a new menu."<br/>
"You will definitely complete your task."<br/>
Ai Fa said to me with a serious face, and then lowered her gaze:<br/>
"Start with the work at hand first… I’m hungry."<br/>
The sunlight shining in through the windows were already red. Ai Fa hunted a large kiba today too, which she carried home with great effort. She was exhausted after skinning and dismembering the kiba.<br/>
As the number of kiba had dwindled a lot, and had been hunting deep in the forest. Ai Fa said that the hunting off season would be here in a few days.<br/>
"By the way, aren’t you discussing with the Fou and Sidora houses about going into the off season together?"<br/>
"Yes. All this while, the off season for each house is different. The Sidora house head proposed that the houses in the vicinity standardize their off season together."<br/>
Ai Fa rubbed her tight belly sub consciously and continued:<br/>
"Around the Fa house are the Fou , Lan, Sidora, Dean… and a kin of the Dean house."<br/>
"Yes, the Leeds house right? I had never spoken to them before."<br/>
"Yes, including the Leeds, there are six houses. We are discussing about these six houses going into the off season together. The Dean and Leeds are the subordinate house of the Zaza house, so Graff Zaza needs to grant his permission."<br/>
"Oh, the Zaza house might be far, but the Forest’s Edge value blood relations over close neighbors, so this is the logical way to go about it."<br/>
When the Tsun clan was their superior house, this proposal would probably get rejected. However, the denizens of Forest’s Edge had changed now. The proposals from small houses like the Fa and Sidora were given equal weight, and they could freely share their opinions with the tribal chiefs houses.<br/>
Be it Genos or the Forest’s Edge, both sides would usher in a period of change. After experiencing the catastrophe brought about by one of their own, what would the future bring for Genos and the Forest’s Edge— as a part of their group, I want to witness this change with my own eyes.<br/>
"Alright, it’s done! Sorry for the wait, house head. After stopping for a month, we are having dinner in the Fa house."<br/>
"Yes."<br/>
I placed the plate before my house head who gave a big nod. Thanks to the Wu clan, the Fa house had gotten new crockeries too.<br/>
Both of us had one plate of soup, while the meat, salad and grilled poitan were each served in large plates. We both had small plates to take food from the common plates, handmade chopsticks, skewers and spoons. The food wasn’t too different, but everything looked much better.<br/>
After Ai Fa said her grace, she picked up the spoon with a smirk on her lips. She then looked at the dishes with a serious face:<br/>
"Hamburg steak…"<br/>
"Yes, it’s hamburg steak."<br/>
If I present a new dish at such a time, she would definitely strangle me.<br/>
I also tried something different with this dish. The reddish brown sauce was made from a variety of vegetables, nyuushi and baam honey, while the side dish was chachi, neenon and aria grilled over a slow fire. This was the proper hamburg steak that was very nostalgic for me.<br/>
"It has been a month since you ate hamburg steak, please have more."<br/>
"Yes."<br/>
Ai Fa picked up the plate of hamburg steak with a serious expression. I sipped on my Tarapa kiba soup as I observed her.<br/>
Ai Fa cut a piece of hamburg steak and sent it into her mouth expressionlessly— and then opened her eyes wide. She looked startled at the cut section of the hamburg steak:<br/>
"Asuta, this hamburg steak—"<br/>
"That’s right. I added curd inside. Curd in hamburg steak."<br/>
"Didn’t you finished all the curd this morning?"<br/>
"Actually, Kamyua helped me buy a little more curd from the Count Turan House. I heard the Turan house was troubled because they couldn’t use up the ingredients."<br/>
For Ai Fa, putting the Camembert cheese-like curd onto the hamburg steak was a luxury. Embedding the curd inside the patty instead of over the meat must be a pleasant surprise for her. Banam honey complemented the hamburg steak just as well as Tarapa and fruit wine sauce.<br/>
"I prepared this dinner for you with all my heart, I hope you will like it."<br/>
Ai Fa ate the meat and curd as she looked at my plate and face a little anxiously.<br/>
She then reluctantly put down her plate, leaned forth and patted my head.<br/>
"It’s delicious."<br/>
"That’s wonderful, thank you."<br/>
I answered with a smile. I won’t waver because of that again.<br/>
And then— Ai Fa took the plate of kiba soup from my hands, placed it carefully on the floor, went around the food between us and hugged me.<br/>
"It’s delicious."<br/>
"I-I get it! The food is getting cold!"<br/>
"I know."<br/>
Ai Fa hugged me with enough strength to crush my bones for 5 seconds, and then went back to her seat.<br/>
She carefully scooped up the curd dripping from the meat patty, and bit the chachi together with the meat.<br/>
"… Delicious."<br/>
"That makes me glad."<br/>
"… Let’s continue later."<br/>
"Continue what?"<br/>
"The food is getting cold."<br/>
There wasn’t any change to Ai Fa’s face, but she seemed very happy.<br/>
Her blue eyes were sparkling like that of a child. On her breasts was the blue gem accessory I gifted her, shining brightly like her third eye.<br/>
What would the future hold for Forest’s Edge and Genos? I want to witness that together with Ai Fa in this ever changing world.<br/>
With that in mind, I picked up the wooden plate to savor the precious hamburg steak.<br/>
