Chapter 62.1 : Rondo of Light and Darkness<br/>
TN : FINALLY, JUST TWO MORE CHAPTER UNTIL WE CAN KISS A GOODBYE TO THIS DAMNED ACT!!!<br/>
===<br/>
◆Dark Knight; Kuroki<br/>
Cr*ap, I reflexively went and saved her.<br/>
This woman was the very same woman who’d almost killed me before. She might come again to try to take my life later.<br/>
And yet, here I am, saving this ungrateful woman.<br/>
「Are you okay, Chiyuki-san!!?」<br/>
A short-haired girl ran towards us.<br/>
「Yeah, I’m okay Nao-san… He save my life.」<br/>
The woman called Chiyuki spoke to the short-haired girl called Nao while looking at me.<br/>
Her long slit eyes were focused on me. Honestly, her eyes were beautiful, but also scary. It felt like she was glaring at me.<br/>
The girl called Nao then looked at me.<br/>
She was my main objective for this mission.<br/>
I stretched out my arm towards her.<br/>
「What’z matter?」<br/>
「Will you return my comrade to me?」<br/>
According to the information I’d received, Nut had been captured by her.<br/>
「Oya, so Onii-chan is looking for Ruby. Ruby, your ride is here.」<br/>
After she spoke, Nut dashed out from her pocket.<br/>
It seems that she’d already realized Nut’s identity.<br/>
「DIEHART-SAMA\~!」<br/>
Nut jumped up at me.<br/>
「IT SPOKEEEEEE!!?」<br/>
Nice scream, Chiyuki.<br/>
Contrary to Nao’s perception, it seems that she hadn’t realized anything.<br/>
「I NEVER EXPECTED THAT YOU’D COME PERSONALLY TO SAVE MEE!!!」<br/>
Nut was crying while clinging on my face.<br/>
「That’s only natural, right. Now please get down for the time being, Nut. I still have to fight the Evil God.」<br/>
I placed Nut back on the floor. Nut would be alright as long as he stayed inside the range of the defensive magic that was protecting the girls.<br/>
「Roger that.」<br/>
With the confirmation, Nut left my side. I looked towards Labrys.<br/>
Labrys was already back up on his feet by now as he looked towards me. He didn’t come close to me. Perhaps he was being vigilant.<br/>
「Let me assist.」<br/>
Though Chiyuki was offering her help, I put my arm to stop her.<br/>
「It’s okay. You should back down to get some rest. Leave him to me.」<br/>
I approached Labrys.<br/>
「Why are you in this place, Dark Knight!? Why are you saving the hero!?」<br/>
The Evil God Labrys shouted at me.<br/>
I wasn’t here to save Reiji. That was just the outcome of me coming to this place. In the first place, why the h*ll do I have to save Reiji?<br/>
「This fire is a hindrance huh…」<br/>
I unleashed my black flames to devour the red blaze that was filling the room.<br/>
「IMPOSSIBLE!! ERASING MY MOROK FIRE SO EASILY!!!」<br/>
Labrys was visibly surprised by that.<br/>
「But of course, God Heibos asked me to defeat you after all…」<br/>
I drew my sword and prepared myself to attack.<br/>
「WAIT A MINUTE!!!」<br/>
I turned around to face the one who’d shouted.<br/>
Reiji came forward.<br/>
「What do you want….」<br/>
「WE’LL WIN EVEN WITHOUT YOUR HELP!!! GET THE HELL OUT OF MY WAY!!!」<br/>
He readied his sword as well as he spoke. One of them was broken, though.<br/>
「It’s not like I come to save you either… 」<br/>
Do as you like, loser. In the first place, it’d be okay even if I didn’t come here to save you. I’m not interested in gaining your gratitude, either.<br/>
I ignored Reiji and pointed my sword towards Labrys.<br/>
「Why are the Hero of Light and the Dark Knight working together!!!? What’s the meaning of this!!?」<br/>
Labrys readied his tomahawk.<br/>
Both Reiji and I stood at the ready against Labrys.<br/>
Thus began the bottle royale between the Dark Knight vs. the Hero of Light vs. the Evil God.<br/>
===<br/>
◆Black Haired Sage; Chiyuki<br/>
「Hey Chiyuki-san, can you tell me what’s going on right now?」<br/>
Rino asked me while her eyes were settled on the ongoing fight.<br/>
「Honestly, even I don’t know what’s happening here…」<br/>
I also fixated my eyes on Reiji and the Dark Knight fighting against Labrys.<br/>
I’ve got no intentions of backing them up. The reason for that being that I could see that Reiji and the Dark Knight’s side were starting to gain the upper hand in the battle.<br/>
Labrys was slowly being cornered by those two.<br/>
Thus, I knew that there was no need for me to step in and assist them. Plus, it’s not like we have any leeway to be able to help them either.<br/>
My mana still needs to be restored so I need to take a break as it stands.<br/>
Sahoko’s burden this time around was especially big. She’s had to keep chanting healing and defensive magic continuously since a while ago.<br/>
I wanted to tell her to take a rest.<br/>
「I have no idea what happened but… we’ve been saved by a hair’s breadth.」<br/>
「Yeah… you’re right.」<br/>
We were able to turn the tables against Labrys after he, the Dark Knight, arrived.<br/>
Though Labrys kept using his fire and lightning on him, he didn’t seem to be affected at all by the attacks.<br/>
He was also able to easily parry Labry’s multi-weapon onslaught with a single sword in his hand. His attacks were also extremely fierce, deadly, and unblockable.<br/>
His power was clearly far above Labrys’.<br/>
Additionally, Reiji was also there.<br/>
He was attacking Labrys alongside the Dark Knight.<br/>
Watching them, it was like watching a sword dance between Reiji’s Sword of Light and the Dark Knight’s Black Flame.<br/>
It was a rondo of light and darkness.<br/>
===<br/>
◆Dark Knight; Kuroki<br/>
「SUNDERING FLASH!!!」<br/>
Reiji’s sword was going after both Labrys and I.<br/>
I bent my body backwards to dodge Reiji’s sword.<br/>
Reiji’s attacks weren’t taking me into consideration at all.<br/>
Well, from Reiji’s perspective, I’m not his ally so I’m basically being treated as an enemy just like Labrys. It’s also why he can calmly use AOE magic despite me standing right in front of him.<br/>
His sole worry was the women behind him.<br/>
Honestly, this was a highly difficult combat.<br/>
I bent my body again to dodge Reiji’s attack coming from behind.<br/>
The slash went past me and landed on Labrys’ body.<br/>
His reaction towards Reiji’s attack was delayed since he was fighting against me just a moment ago.<br/>
Labrys kneeled down on one knee from the pressure of attack.<br/>
「WHY! WHY ARE THE HERO OF LIGHT AND THE DARK KNIGHT WORKING TOGETHER!!!」<br/>
Labrys screamed at the top of his lungs.<br/>
But, of course, it wasn’t anything close to the definition of working together.<br/>
It was simply Labrys’ misunderstanding.<br/>
At a glance, it might look like we’re working together, but, all I was doing was dodging Reiji’s attacks that were coming from behind.<br/>
We’re definitely not working together.<br/>
Labrys fired lightning from his horn and fire from his mouth.<br/>
But, both of them didn’t work on me.<br/>
Labrys pointed both his spear and tomahawk at me and swung both of them, forming a wide arc with each swing.<br/>
Those levels of attack won’t be able to kill me.<br/>
I parried the tomahawk, turning my body to add more power against Labrys’ residual force and sliced his arms before dodging his spear attack.<br/>
And then, Reiji, who’d readied his sword, stabbed at where I was just a moment ago. I avoided being skewered by Reiji’s sword by a hair’s breadth.<br/>
Reiji kept charging at Labrys without pause.<br/>
Labrys reacted too late and was blown away.<br/>
「MOOOOOOOOOOOOO!!!」<br/>
Labrys was rolling on the floor.<br/>
But, in the next moment, his wounds recovered as soon as the room shone.<br/>
Labrys immediately stood up as if nothing had happened to him.<br/>
「I’M INVICIBLEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEE!!!」<br/>
Labrys screamed at the top of his lungs.<br/>
Labrys’ attacks couldn’t hurt me and the damage from our attacks against him were healed in no time.<br/>
It was troublesome, but we couldn’t defeat him within the confines of this labyrinth.<br/>
That’s why we needed to end this fight as soon as possible. And for that reason, I kept leading him little by little towards the edge of the room during the battle.<br/>
「SHIRONE, NOW!!」<br/>
I signaled to Shirone as soon as we arrived at the edge of the room.<br/>
Something then leaped out from the entrance of the room at breakneck speed all the way towards the altar located in the inner part of the room.<br/>
It was Shirone.<br/>
「WHAT THE!?」<br/>
Labrys only noticed Shirone’s presence a moment later.<br/>
By then, Shirone had already arrived in front of the altar.<br/>
