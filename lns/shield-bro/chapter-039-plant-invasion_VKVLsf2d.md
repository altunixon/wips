Chapter 39  <br/>
 <br/>
Plant Invasion <br/>
 <br/>
Naofumi: "Raphtalia, Firo, be careful." <br/>
 <br/>
Now then, the enemy is coming with a plant. <br/>
According to my vast knowledge of medical herbs, the plant in front is quite unique. <br/>
Various ripe fruits could be found from the vines and potatoes could be seen on the root. <br/>
That's not all, apparently it also has the ability to spit poison and attach parasites to the human body. <br/>
Is the herbicide even going to be effective? <br/>
Physically beating it up doesn't seem to be a good plan either… <br/>
It attacked us with vines as it advanced. <br/>
 <br/>
Raphtalia: "Haa!" <br/>
Firo: "Yaa!" <br/>
 <br/>
Raphtalia and Firo each cut down some vines. <br/>
But, we have already been surrounded by them. <br/>
Might as well try magic... <br/>
 <br/>
Naofumi: "I am the Hero of the Shield who commands the origin of power. I have read and deciphered a law of nature. May the power of nature defend me!" <br/>
Naofumi: "Fast Guard!" <br/>
 <br/>
I applied defensive magic on Raphtalia and Firo. <br/>
This magic improved the target's defence by a percentage. It is a support magic that shines when the target has high Defence. <br/>
 <br/>
Raphtalia: "Thank you Naofumi-sama" <br/>
Firo: "Thanks~" <br/>
 <br/>
The pair thanks me as they continue to decimate the attacking vines. <br/>
Although we are destroying plants left and right, it's still hard to advance. <br/>
It's got to be that. To clear a path, we must use some strong magic, I guess our only choice is to withdraw for now. <br/>
But at least, we'll annihilate the enemies here. <br/>
There is a high chance that a strong demon is lurking within the village. <br/>
According to the stories that have been passed down, there is no sure-fire way to exterminate the plants. <br/>
Then a full frontal assault... <br/>
Would be impossible, there has to be another way. <br/>
Due to the vine's lacking in attack power, my progress should be unimpeded. <br/>
 <br/>
Naofumi:"Anyway, I'll investigate myself first." <br/>
Raphtalia: "Okay!" <br/>
Firo: "Okay~!" <br/>
 <br/>
I started running towards the root of the plants in the centre of the village. <br/>
It's overflowing with plant demons. <br/>
Though, this level is still manageable by the three of us. <br/>
However, I'm quite uneasy about Raphtalia and Firo's defence. <br/>
 <br/>
Naofumi: "Humm......" <br/>
 <br/>
The names of the demons are Bio Plant, Plantriwe, and Mandoragora. <br/>
 <br/>
Bio Plant is the general name for all the common plants. Plantriwe Is a demon in the shape of a human made of vines. Mandoragora seems to be an immobile plant fortress. <br/>
According to Firo, the Plantriwe scatters poison pollen the big flower on top of its head. <br/>
The Mandoragora sprays acid from a vine to weaken and drag in its prey.  <br/>
Bio Plant is the demon that is producing these two. Occasionally, a vine swells up and these demons burst from within. <br/>
 <br/>
I smile in satisfaction as the herbicide withers these demons. <br/>
It seems the shield does not consider scattering herbicide an attack. <br/>
Is it because these are just really aggressive plants and not actually demons? <br/>
I wonder what the criteria is. <br/>
Is it the same principal as sprinkling holy water and recovery magic on Zombie-Type Monsters? <br/>
There is also the fact that my medicine can cure the parasitic state to consider.... <br/>
I don't understand. <br/>
Perhaps the parasites are pathogens and my treatment medicine is effective against sicknesses. <br/>
 <br/>
Naofumi: "So what do we do?" <br/>
 <br/>
Plantriwe and vines continued to attack me meaninglessly. <br/>
The attacks themselves do nothing, but my nose is slightly stuffed because of the poison. <br/>
The acid is also troublesome. It seems to be very effective in lowering the Defensive status. <br/>
Still, it's not as if they can break through. Snake's Poison Fang (Intermediate) makes those effects useless. <br/>
This is pretty common. The enemy is a plant and uses poison. <br/>
 <br/>
Naofumi: "Raphtalia" <br/>
Raphtalia: "Cough...! What is it?" <br/>
 <br/>
The air seems to be bad for Raphtalia... <br/>
Raphtalia's respiratory system was damaged before. Although she is cured, it might still be weak. <br/>
 <br/>
Naofumi: "Here, take this herbicide just in case." <br/>
Raphtalia: "Ah, Okay!" <br/>
 <br/>
I throw some herbicide to Raphtalia. I hope it will be useful in an emergency <br/>
 <br/>
Raphtalia is caught by vines and it looks like she's about to be violated. <br/>
 <br/>
The ways these vines wriggle about remind me of heroines from an eroge… <br/>
 <br/>
Raphtalia: "Naofumi-sama?" <br/>
 <br/>
Raphtalia: "You're thinking of something quite rude aren't you?" <br/>
 <br/>
However, when the vines wrap around Raphtalia, she tears them apart calmly. <br/>
Unexpectedly, it seems like they have no durability. <br/>
 <br/>
Raphtalia: "Naofumi-sama? Let's hurry up and go!" <br/>
Naofumi: "O-okay" <br/>
 <br/>
When I arrived at the centre of the village earlier, I saw a gigantic tree. <br/>
No wait, if I look carefully, that's a giant vine. <br/>
 <br/>
Naofumi: "That seems to be the main body..." <br/>
 <br/>
Suddenly, huge eyes appeared on the trunk and stared at us. <br/>
 <br/>
Monster: "!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!" <br/>
 <br/>
That's creepy. <br/>
But, that is the main body. <br/>
 <br/>
Firo: "Master~ Firo's going in" <br/>
 <br/>
Firo does a running jump onto an eyeball from the main body. However, she is intercepted by a giant vine. <br/>
 <br/>
Firo: "Ei!" <br/>
 <br/>
Firo kicks the vine mid-air, using it as a foothold, but the distance she gained is insufficient. <br/>
 <br/>
Firo: "Master~" <br/>
Naofumi: "I know! Air Strike Shield!" <br/>
 <br/>
I used Air Strike Shield on where Firo was falling to let her use it as footing. <br/>
Firo jumped off the shield and straight for the eyeball again. <br/>
 <br/>
Firo: "Tei!" <br/>
 <br/>
Bicha! With a squish, Firo kicked the eyeball. <br/>
That was pretty gross... <br/>
 <br/>
Monster: "!!!!!!!!!!" <br/>
 <br/>
The earth shakes as the vines tremble in rage. <br/>
Is it still not dead even after the eyeball was destroyed? <br/>
Hmm...... What happened? <br/>
 <br/>
Naofumi: "It's not falling over." <br/>
Raphtalia: "I noticed." <br/>
 <br/>
With a grotesque sound, the eyeball regenerated. <br/>
At the same time, I spotted a plant seed in the middle of the eyeball. <br/>
 <br/>
Naofumi: "Raphtalia, Firo. The main body is within that eyeball. Pour the herbicide in it." <br/>
 <br/>
The cool-down time is over. I can use Air Strike Shield again. By the way, Plantriwe and Mandoragora were attacking me together. <br/>
But it does nothing so I can take it forever. <br/>
 <br/>
Naofumi: "I understand!" <br/>
Firo: "Roger~!" <br/>
 <br/>
Raphtalia Jumps onto Firo's back while approaching the regenerating eyeball. <br/>
The eyeball must have registered them as the highest priority threat and unleashed a rain of vines at them. <br/>
 <br/>
Naofumi: "Shield Prison!" <br/>
 <br/>
I used the cage formed from Shield Prison to protect both of them. <br/>
The shield will stay in the air, unless an attack is strong enough to break through. <br/>
Effective time is 15 seconds. <br/>
Meanwhile, the vines are bouncing off the Prison. <br/>
Oops... Vines surrounded the Prison. <br/>
After 15 seconds, the Prison disperses. At that moment, I cast Air Strike Shield under Firo to be used as a foothold. <br/>
 <br/>
Raphtalia: "Tei!" <br/>
 <br/>
Raphtalia's sword flashes and the vines surrounding Firo was cut down. <br/>
The vines were cut beautifully and Firo succeed in jumping off the shield. <br/>
She kicked the Eyeball twice. <br/>
 <br/>
Monster: "!?????" <br/>
 <br/>
The eyeball's movements have stopped to repair itself. <br/>
By taking advantage of this chance, Raphtalia spreads the herbicide over the eyeball's wounds. <br/>
 <br/>
Monster: "!!!!!?????" <br/>
 <br/>
An enormous vibration which isn't exactly a voice spreads around the Bio Plant. <br/>
 <br/>
Naofumi: "Did we do it?" <br/>
 <br/>
I don't even care that I death flagged myself, these attacks aren't even enough to make me itchy. <br/>
However, the Bio Plant begins to move again. <br/>
 <br/>
Raphtalia: "I apologize. It seems I didn't spread the herbicide well enough." <br/>
Naofumi: "No, you did it properly. It seems the herbicide is not effective enough." <br/>
 <br/>
There must be something we can do... <br/>
Oh, that might work. <br/>
Personally applying medicine makes it more effective. I wonder what will happen if I apply the herbicide myself. <br/>
 <br/>
Naofumi: "Well, it won't hurt to try that next." <br/>
 <br/>
I ignored the enemies surrounding me and took out the herbicide with one hand. <br/>
Though recently, I've noticed that my defence is now ranged, I can proceed through enemies even though I’m surrounded. <br/>
However, this doesn't apply to my attacks. <br/>
I stroll through the large amount of demons like it's nothing. <br/>
At last, I've reached the Bio Plant. <br/>
 <br/>
Naofumi: "The effect might increase even more if I apply the herbicide while riding Firo." <br/>
 <br/>
I scattered the herbicide on all its roots. <br/>
 <br/>
Monster: "!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!???????????" <br/>
 <br/>
The Bio Plant convulsed violently. It seems to be its death throes. <br/>
The Bio Plant is dyed brown as its eyeballs dries up. <br/>
With a poof, the whole thing started falling apart. <br/>
The whole Bio Plant crumbles and we evacuate. <br/>
 <br/>
Naofumi: "Oooh..." <br/>
 <br/>
All the other demons started turning brown and withering. Everything is gone except for fruits that grew on their bodies and us left. <br/>
And...Where the Bio Plant used to be is a shiny seed. <br/>
... It would be dangerous to leave that here... <br/>
 <br/>
Naofumi: "I'll keep it for the time being. Maybe my shield can absorb it." <br/>
Raphtalia: "Okay" <br/>
Firo: "Food!" <br/>
 <br/>
We were collecting seeds while Firo stuffed herself with the remaining fruits and potatoes.
