Sorry for the delay, last week was very tiring for me, and I also lost a bit of motivation.I took some time to regain my motivation. I intended to post it on Wednesday but the last parts were harder than I expected so it took me some more time.<br/>
I discovered that there’s a rip off site that doesn’t give credits to translators of novel, nor linking to the original translations. Even to those who worked as editors and TL checkers.<br/>
I was pretty pissed off when I found the site and saw my translations. They don’t even ask TL if they can host their work, even if it’s only to work as archive but the best thing we can do is ignoring them, and that’s what I’ll do.<br/>
So here’s your chapter of Manuke FPS for the week. I’ll start translating chapter 3 of Himekishi to Camping Car later today and hope to finish it by the end of the week.<br/>
