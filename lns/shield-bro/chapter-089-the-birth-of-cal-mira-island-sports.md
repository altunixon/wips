I will not be putting this in the chapter due to it’s differences with the text.<br/>
Chapter 89 – The Birth of Cal Mira Island Sports<br/>
After listening to Raphtalia’s story, it was already evening, and the timing to go out has been missed.<br/>
If we go out now, it would be to another island for a night hunt.<br/>
Though time is precious, I would rather not night battle too much. It is dangerous……<br/>
Shopping at the market would be fine, but……I already went yesterday.<br/>
Till now I was making medicine and accessories, or studying magic, but as for the former, I am out of materials.<br/>
After returning I will be taught the latter by someone the queen prepares.<br/>
We who had free time were bored.<br/>
With that said, we decided to play at the beach until dusk.<br/>
Firo:"Wahoi~!"<br/>
Firo is playing in the sea.<br/>
She is having fun in water and noisily trying to dive underwater like a waterfowl.<br/>
It’s that isn’t it.<br/>
I feel that is swimming practice.<br/>
At first glance it seems she is drowning.<br/>
I mean, can you even sink?…… floating while her feet stick up through the surface. It is a very funny appearance.<br/>
Her pose reminds me of a guy that was killed in the same position somewhere. What was it again?<br/>
It was a village with a dog. I cannot remember the details.<br/>
These four months here of being separated from the Otaku culture, and originally I could only inference animes based on their titles.<br/>
Naofumi:"Levels did not rise at all. Bad Raphtalia."<br/>
Raphtalia:"Ehh……It can’t be helped. After moving it was night…… It was also trouble since we had to return the next morning."<br/>
Naofumi:"This staff exchange is evil."<br/>
Raphtalia:"That’s right……I hoped that time back then would pass faster, though it is enjoyable right now."<br/>
Naofumi:"I guess……"<br/>
We borrowed bathing suits from the hotel to play at the beach.<br/>
What can I say, a tropical country’s sea is beautiful.<br/>
Really, I’ve had this thought before, it feels like I came to Hawaii and Guam.<br/>
Naofumi:"Looking carefully, a lot of other fellows are playing on the beach like us."<br/>
Raphtalia:"Yeah, certainly……"<br/>
Naofumi:"Raphtalia, do you have the ball?"<br/>
Raphtalia:"I put it in the room at the hotel……"<br/>
Naofumi:"I see……It should be possible to rent a ball somewhere."<br/>
For some reason even though I look around, there is no shop dealing with recreational goods.<br/>
There is a resting place, like a seaside clubhouse, but there are no stores for toys in order to play at the sea.<br/>
Since it’s hot, there is a store that sells cold items.<br/>
However, a shop meant for playing at the sea doesn’t exist.<br/>
……There are no surfboards either.<br/>
For a guy like Motoyasu, surfing cannot be just a hobby. That’s it.<br/>
While thinking and looking around I spotted Motoyasu.<br/>
It seems he has recovered from earlier, and is accompanying Bitch.<br/>
He didn’t learn his lesson. It would be annoying to speak to him since Bitch is there, I don’t feel like it.<br/>
Raphtalia:"What are you thinking about?"<br/>
Naofumi:"With great pains we are finally playing on the beach. I think beach volleyball would be fine."<br/>
Raphtalia:"There is training for the lower body on the beach that requires keeping the ball in the air! I’ll get it!"<br/>
After listening to my suggestion Raphtalia ran selfishly.<br/>
……I seemed to have raised a little bit of a muscle brain.<br/>
This was not aimed at training in particular……<br/>
Raphtalia’s criteria is fundamentally mistaken……Though that’s probably my fault.<br/>
Firo:"What happened to onee-chan?"<br/>
Naofumi:"She went to fetch a ball."<br/>
Firo:"Hmm. Play ball?"<br/>
Naofumi:"It seems so."<br/>
Firo:"Firo is bored. Going to play more."<br/>
Naofumi:"Oh. Do your best."<br/>
Firo:"Yeah!"<br/>
While drawing the lines for beach volleyball……Raphtalia brings the ball.<br/>
The ball that was made from balloon for children, has been cherished by Rapthalia for a long time.<br/>
Training to strengthen the lower body on the beach, huh……<br/>
Naofumi:"Raphtalia, you got a second?"<br/>
Raphtalia:"What? Go ahead."<br/>
I take a good look at Rapthalia’s upper arm.<br/>
Always doing muscle training, though her muscles don’t seem to be in proportion to her status gained from killing monsters.<br/>
Raphtalia:"What is it?"<br/>
Naofumi:"Raphtalia, are you hiding your figure with magic?"<br/>
Raphtalia is part of the raccoon race, specializing in illusion magic, and has affinity with light and darkness systems.<br/>
In other words, it is possible to fake her own appearance.<br/>
Raphtalia:"Why would I do something so useless?"<br/>
Naofumi:"……Raphtalia, stay as you are. "<br/>
Raphtalia:"What…….? I understand."<br/>
Ratphalia’s aspiration to improve herself is excellent.<br/>
After that, I explained the simple rules of beach volleyball.<br/>
It’s not the full-fledged ones, just not dropping the ball, how to handle the ball, and passing to the other party.<br/>
Raphtalia:"Then I’m starting! Tei!"<br/>
Naofumi:"What kind of-!"<br/>
A fierce beach volleyball match on the beach began between Raphtalia and Firo.<br/>
From the beginning they start rushing to spike, it has already surpassed a competition and has become a fierce battle.<br/>
Both of their movements are quick. It’s like watching wire action<br/>
When I looked around, I noticed that people began to gather and happily mimic what they were doing.<br/>
Well, since there aren’t that many people with balls, there is one that substituted a ball with a round cloth……<br/>
Those who are imitating the offense and defense of Rapthalia and Firo can be called beach volleyball.<br/>
Raphtalia:"Is Naofumi-sama not going to do it?"<br/>
While performing a dash Rapthalia asks me.<br/>
Naofumi:"Nope…… I cannot do that."<br/>
Raphtalia:"?"<br/>
Did I say something strange? Raphtalia and Firo look like they are playing with the ball leisurely.<br/>
What a high level.<br/>
I could not keep up with their physical strength.<br/>
Naofumi:"I’m fine with just watching."<br/>
Firo:"Really? It will be more fun if Master plays together."<br/>
Naofumi:"This is closer to actual fighting than playing."<br/>
Is this is influence of Class Up, they’ve become superhuman. These guys.<br/>
If I keep them company I will have to get serious, and that’s tiring. I’m also still in treatment.<br/>
Naofumi:"Oh right. There is also beach flag."<br/>
When I say that, Firo’s eyes sparkle. The beach volleyball game was interrupted, she runs up to me.<br/>
Firo:"What is it!? How do you play!?"<br/>
Uh……<br/>
Naofumi:"Anyway, stab a stick in the ground first"<br/>
Firo:"Okay!"<br/>
I pick up a stick and stab the ground with it.<br/>
Naofumi:"Afterwards."<br/>
Walk 20 meters from the stick and turn around.<br/>
Naofumi:"In the mean time, Raphtalia and Firo, come here."<br/>
Raphtalia:"Okay."<br/>
Firo:"Okay~!"<br/>
Both of them obediently come to me.<br/>
Naofumi:"Then, face each other on the other side of the stick while lying down."<br/>
Raphtalia:’Like this?"<br/>
Firo:"This way?"<br/>
Both of them lie down according to my instructions.<br/>
Naofumi:"I’ll say Ready, and Don! After I say that, get up immediately and pick up the stick I stabbed in the ground, the one who gets the stick wins. However, you must not interfere with your opponent."<br/>
Raphtalia:"That sounds fun."<br/>
Firo:"Yup!"<br/>
Naofumi:"Now for practice."<br/>
A gallery was made. It looks like some adventurers are excitedly watching with expectations.<br/>
Is it because this is a different world? There doesn’t seem to be much playing here.<br/>
Naofumi:"Ready……"<br/>
Both of them are waiting for me to speak.<br/>
Naofumi:"Don! Go——-!"<br/>
Immediately after, I was blasted with, and buried under a mountain of sand.<br/>
Raphtalia and Firo are the criminals. Even if just a little quicker, for the sake of winning they simultaneously kicked the sand.<br/>
By the way, it seems Firo won.<br/>
I was buried in sand and couldn’t tell.<br/>
Firo:"This is Firo’s victory!"<br/>
Raphtalia:"Next time I won’t lose!"<br/>
Naofumi:"Kicking sand everywhere with such power! Know some limits!"<br/>
What we were playing at that time…… Carried on to become a major competition after.<br/>
Having said that, I did not know that this was a prototype for something else in this world though.<br/>
Rapthalia and Firo played at the beach until the day was over.<br/>
Some adventurers joined too, and the beach volleyball and beach flag ended in success.<br/>
Well, it was good for killing time.<br/>
Raphtalia seemed to be satisfied with body strengthening as a principle.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
