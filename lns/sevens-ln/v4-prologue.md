Sevens Volume 4 Prologue<br/>
<br/>
Prologue<br/>
<br/>
I think responsibility is something heavy.<br/>
The four of us who are walking in this city that looks jumbled up, are adventurers who are going to switch our base of operations from Dalien to here, the academy city Arumsaas.<br/>
There is a reason why we moved from Dalien, that is convenient for beginners, to Arumsaas, where people gather to gain both knowledge and skill.<br/>
I, Lyle Walt, am a former noble──I was the eldest son of a Count house.<br/>
I lost in a match against my little sister Celes and got chased out from the house. After that I was reduced to being an adventurer.<br/>
On top of that, I am ignorant of society because I was living a life that was like house arrest in my house for many years. Because of that I’m treated as an ignorant spoiled young master. That is the evaluation of the surroundings after they saw me.<br/>
And someone like me is the leader of an adventurer party……it’s a position with responsibility.<br/>
High buildings that pierced into the sky as though they’re competing with each other are standing in a row as though they’re boasting their novel structure.<br/>
We are walking under the shadows of those buildings, even so we who are going to the adventurer guild from the inn are sweating from the blazing sun.<br/>
When I touched my blue hair, it’s a bit wet from sweat.<br/>
I took off my jacket and held it in my arm because it’s too hot. Above my shirt is a silver pendant that is a heirloom. A blue jewel is embedded at the top of the pendant.<br/>
Today too it’s shining disgustingly bright.<br/>
We avoided the sunlight while walking on the path that is covered with bricks. The road before this was stone paving.<br/>
「It’s really all jumbled up.」<br/>
Walking behind me, Aria Lockwarde whose red hair gave a lively impression is also holding the same thought.<br/>
「I’ve thought it since when I saw this city from outside, and after seeing the inside this city really does look like a boy’s toy box.」<br/>
Toy box. Certainly before we entered into Arumsaas and looked at it from afar, we could see several buildings peeking out from behind the outer wall.<br/>
Each of them is a building with unique look. That lack of unity……makes it look like a toy box somewhat.<br/>
Wearing a black robe and carrying the battle axe that is her family heirloom on her back, Sophia Rowley wiped her sweat frequently.<br/>
Aria-san’s purple eyes are watching Sophia-san who is like that with a fed-up look.<br/>
「How about you take off that thick robe? I’m feeling hot just from looking at you.」<br/>
She has long black hair and strong-willed black eyes. Sophia-san is too serious for an adventurer. Perhaps it’s the influence of her background as a daughter of a vassal noble.<br/>
According to the person herself, it seems she has strong reluctance showing her skin.<br/>
「It’s to keep my skin from showing and to block the sunlight. Besides, under my robe I’m wearing attire that shows my body line like Aria. ……I can’t show it outside.」<br/>
Naturally she is wearing clothes that are easy to move in under her robe. In contrast with the shy Sophia-san, Aria-san showed no sign of being bothered with her attire.<br/>
Aria-san is also a former capital noble from a Baron house──even though her house had a higher social standing than Sophia-san’s house, and yet there is this kind of difference between them. Why is that?<br/>
When Sophia-san moved in a way to hide her large breasts, Aria-san who saw that looked at her own breasts. Although I think that I mustn’t compare them, as expected Aria-san is far smaller than Sophia-san.<br/>
Teasing voices came at me who is comparing the two’s breasts.<br/>
They’re male voices. The voices aren’t from people walking around us making fun of me.<br/>
The voices came from the Jewel.<br/>
The Arts that are recorded in the Jewel──also included the memories of their original owner. They are existences that taught me how to use the Arts and also talked to me like this.<br/>
But, these people──the six ancestors of the Walt House cannot be called as people of lofty virtue even as flattery.<br/>
The Second who is dressed like a hunter and knew about the early days of the Walt House is exasperated.<br/>
"What are these two idiots doing? Also Lyle, you’re staring at their breasts too much. Novem-chan will be disgusted at you."<br/>
The Third, a blond haired handsome man with a carefree personality is provoking me.<br/>
"Does Lyle like breasts? Though, as for me I think the butt is more important. But, I never did anything rude like Lyle who is staring hard like that."<br/>
Certainly all the ancestors have amazing sides to them. But, perhaps because they are my relatives or because I’m their direct descendant……the way they talk to me is merciless.<br/>
The Fourth who is wearing glasses and looking scrupulous sighed at me.<br/>
"Haa, that behavior is really rude. Lyle, think of the girl’s feeling."<br/>
I never studied anything like a girl’s feeling, or rather I was living like I was in house arrest for so long that I grew up not knowing how to interact with other people in the first place.<br/>
Strangely there is also a problem of me losing my memories of when I was around ten years old. It seems that in the past I was a lively child who was polite and intelligent. Unlike the me right now.<br/>
Even the Fifth who normally doesn’t talk much and often looks disinterested is exasperated. But, it’s not towards me but to the Fourth.<br/>
"The saying of a certain someone who couldn’t talk back to his wife is really different."<br/>
A tension was formed between the Fifth and the Fourth inside the Jewel.<br/>
These ancestors, because they have the memories of their lives, the relationships between each of them while they were alive are also continued to this time.<br/>
In other words, the family problems from the past are also continued without change even now.<br/>
Someone laughed heartily. It’s the Sixth who is like a big brother to me. He is somewhat kinder to me compared to the other ancestors.<br/>
He has characteristic bristling hair and beard. His body is the biggest among the ancestors.<br/>
"Lyle is also a man after all, so of course he will be interested in that kind of thing. I too, when I was young, was really──"<br/>
It makes me embarrassed listening to him. It felt like I’m being laughed at at a family meeting.<br/>
The last was the Seventh. My grandfather coughed.<br/>
He has a stern face and swept back hair. The Seventh has an atmosphere that is fitting for a noble.<br/>
"As expected from someone who was playing around, what he said is different."<br/>
His remark towards the Sixth is thorny.<br/>
The Jewel today is also noisy which sucked up my mana. However, this conversation──whether for good or bad cannot be heard by anyone else other than me.<br/>
The comrades around me, the people passing by me, and the people walking at the same direction as me cannot hear these voices.<br/>
And so, if I try to talk with them carelessly, then I will be treated as a dangerous guy who is talking to himself. It’s unreasonable.<br/>
When I’m going to grab the Jewel to quiet them down, my last comrade──my former fiancée peeked into my face.<br/>
Her purple eyes reflected me. I raised up my guard, wondering if she is going to warn me about staring at breasts.<br/>
「Wha, what is it, Novem.」<br/>
She is a magician with her long hair that is shiny in golden brown color tied into a side ponytail. She is wearing a navy blue robe, and her hand is holding a silver staff that she brought from her house.<br/>
Her name is Novem──Novem Forxuz. She is the second daughter of a Baron house that has a long association with the Walt House, and a former fiancée who came chasing after me.<br/>
If Novem wasn’t there, then the me right now wouldn’t exist. She has helped me so much I can say that with certainty. She is an existence who I can’t go against.<br/>
She has good looks, her skill in magic is also excellent, she is perfect in everything……well, not really but, anyway she is really reliable.<br/>
「No, it’s because Lyle-sama is making a tired face since some time ago. Also Lyle-sama, did you bring the necessary paperwork?」<br/>
I took out the paperwork and guild card──a silver plate from my bag.<br/>
The guild card is a set of two cards. One card is to be owned by the adventurer, while the other card is to be kept by the guild. If the owner dies, then the name that is carved on the guild card will get scratched with a horizontal line, notifying of the owner’s death. It’s a convenient tool.<br/>
Also, for some reason, a guild card won’t get absorbed in a dungeon. It also won’t be consumed even if a monster ate it.<br/>
「I have the paperwork for the adventurer guild with me. Don’t worry that much.」<br/>
I’m thankful for Novem’s devotion but, when I’m thinking if I’m looking that unreliable it made me feel irritated.<br/>
Novem said 「I’m sorry」 and turned forward before she started walking again. Then the Second’s voice came from inside the Jewel.<br/>
"Don’t be angry like that. She was only asking."<br/>
The Third spoke strangely understandingly.<br/>
"Is it that? You know, won’t it be the rough period for Lyle soon?"<br/>
The teasing voice of the ancestors and their instructions recently feel really annoying to me.<br/>
The Fourth was in understanding.<br/>
"Aa~, that’s possible. It’s a difficult age after all."<br/>
I rolled the Jewel with my fingertips so that the ancestors would be quiet.<br/>
.<br/>
「Eh? We cannot enter the dungeon?」<br/>
I presented the necessary paperwork for doing activity in Arumsaas to the adventurer guild’s reception and took care of the procedures while receiving an explanation.<br/>
But, there I’m notified of the fact that Arumsaas’s famous underground dungeon──the large scale dungeon that is evaluated as giving good earnings, it cannot be entered by us.<br/>
The guild staff member who is wearing round frame glasses is thin and slightly bald. Unlike Dalien’s staff who gave kind and polite treatment, this staff member is obviously looking down on us.<br/>
「Adventurers who don’t have any trust or strength cannot enter inside the dungeon. That is the rule here.」<br/>
This is troubling.<br/>
We have some leeway with the money at hand and we only come to Arumsaas in order to learn various things, so there is really no problem even if we don’t enter the dungeon──is not actually the case with us.<br/>
「Can’t you do something about it? What should we do so we can enter the dungeon?」<br/>
The staff member answered me in irritation.<br/>
「You can obtain trust if you diligently defeat monsters outside and sell a certain amount of magic stones to the guild. Other than that your number is lacking. Are you planning to enter the dungeon with only four people? Even if you have good equipment your number isn’t enough.」<br/>
Number. The staff member said that a four man party is too little.<br/>
In the first place we planned to search for comrades in Arumsaas.<br/>
I hung my head down. At any rate, if it’s like this…….<br/>
「You’re telling us to defeat monsters outside under this blazing sun?」<br/>
When I unconsciously muttered that, the staff member’s reaction is cold.<br/>
「Isn’t that an adventurer’s job? Please gather magic stones without complaining. Good grief, it’s troubling that the magic stones’ gathering is decreasing when it’s summer or winter.」<br/>
Yes, the season is summer. It’s really difficult to fight against monsters under this blazing sun.<br/>
I imagined carrying heavy luggage while walking around under the blazing sun to search for monsters. Naturally we would have to take more rest than normal in that situation. If not we would collapse.<br/>
It will consume stamina intensely, and then although it would depend on what kind of monster it is……I don’t think we will be able to earn much money.<br/>
After the staff member finished the procedure, his gaze told me to get lost from the reception right away.<br/>
The staff here are terribly cold towards adventurers.<br/>
The guild is a two-storied building. It’s not really big. Several display boards to put up requests are placed in the reception lobby at the first floor.<br/>
I left the reception and headed to the three who are waiting. I explained the situation.<br/>
Novem’s expression clouded.<br/>
「That’s, quite troubling. I didn’t hear about such circumstance before.」<br/>
However, Aria-san and Sophia-san seem to not understand. Aria-san tilted her head and asked Novem.<br/>
「We earned a lot of money at Dalien didn’t we? We will be alright for a while right?」<br/>
Certainly before we left Dalien, we participated in a dungeon subjugation and earned a lot. However, I can’t say that it will be enough with that.<br/>
Novem explained to Aria-san.<br/>
「Just like in Dalien, we will have to stay at an inn here in Arumsaas. If we’re searching for an inn of a certain standard, then the price will be quite high as expected. Besides, we also came here to learn various things.」<br/>
Sophia-san nodded.<br/>
「Yes. That’s why, isn’t it alright even if we aren’t really fixated with working?」<br/>
The Second inside the Jewel spoke with a slightly rough voice hearing that. The Second’s attitude towards Aria-san and Sophia-san is strict no matter what.<br/>
"Don’t they understand that they aren’t so well-off that they won’t be able to study without doing anything else? Besides living like that will cause their fighting sense to dull right away. Are they planning to play around in Arumsaas the whole time huh?"<br/>
There are a lot of reasons to work.<br/>
In the first place, we’re planning to search for comrades in Arumsaas. In that case, it’s better to regularly visit the guild to gather information.<br/>
Also, doing nothing but studying will dull our senses in regards to battle just like the Second said.<br/>
Besides, right now there are only four of us, but perhaps our number will soon increase by four or six.<br/>
We are using an inn and on top of that we’re mostly eating out. Our living expenses are really high.<br/>
The tools that we’re using habitually also use up money. Even if we don’t use them, we will still need to give them maintenance. For me it’s my saber. Just because I don’t use it doesn’t mean that it won’t need maintenance.<br/>
It’s an important tool that I’m entrusting my life to. It needs to be taken care of everyday. And then, money is also necessary to take care of it. It’s the so called maintenance cost.<br/>
「……Whether it’s knowledge or skill, the more advanced and the more necessary it is, the more it will take time and money. We will have to work moderately but……it will be difficult to work outside.」<br/>
Novem also seems to understand just how difficult it would be to go outside in this season.<br/>
Sophia-san seemed to understand. Her face is tensing.<br/>
「Now that you mention it, it will be difficult from here due to the season. Thinking that it will still become even hotter after this, going outside is……」<br/>
But, if it’s inside a dungeon, that kind of problem will be resolved even though there is also a lot of danger there.<br/>
Actually, there are a lot of dungeons with relatively well ordered environments that people can easily enter in order to lure humans into it. I heard that Arumsaas’s underground dungeon is also that kind of dungeon.<br/>
In addition, because there will definitely be a fixed number of monsters within the limited space, it’s extremely easy to earn money there.<br/>
Rather than going outside to search around for monsters, entering a dungeon is absolutely more efficient.<br/>
If we can enter the dungeon once or twice per month, we will be able to solve our money problem but…….<br/>
「I never thought that the guild’s permission will be needed to enter the dungeon. No, perhaps in this case the problem is the strict judging?」<br/>
We are lacking the number of people and trust from the guild.<br/>
Aria-san understood the situation and muttered.<br/>
「Arumsaas is a troublesome place huh.」<br/>
I agree.<br/>
However, really, just what are we going to do?<br/>
A commotion happened while the three of us are feeling bewildered due to things that are contrary to our expectations.<br/>
When we turned our gaze toward the commotions, we saw a group of adventurers.<br/>
The Third whistled inside the Jewel. He explained the situation to me with a carefree tone.<br/>
"Looks like they are spoiled young nobles. Did they hire adventurers to enter the dungeon? It seems like they are having a quarrel from the look of it."<br/>
The Seventh spat out without interest.<br/>
"Lyle, it’s not something for you to get involved with. Get out of here right away."<br/>
He said that, but the atmosphere is obviously dangerous. It attracted my attention.<br/>
Haughty looking young people are talking on and on in front of a girl. The surroundings are trying to not get involved with the group. The staff that left the counter are also obviously allied with the haughty young people.<br/>
It gives me an unpleasant feeling seeing that.<br/>
Sophia-san also heard the commotion and made a displeased face.<br/>
The reason is simple.<br/>
「A mere supporter should feel grateful just from being able to receive a reward. We were risking our life protecting you!」<br/>
A high-handed young man is wearing expensive looking equipment. The reason why I can clearly understand they’re expensive is because there are a lot of decorations on them.<br/>
There are too many unnecessary decorations for fighting there.<br/>
In contrast, the adventurer girl who was called a supporter has a peculiar equipment.<br/>
She looks like she is wearing only the arm part of armor from her upper arm until her fingertips. However only her left arm is wearing that, other than that she is wearing clothes made from cloth or leather that are easy to move in.<br/>
Her blue hair is cut sloppily. It’s disheveled looking like they aren’t really cared after. Her red eyes that are visible from the lenses of her glasses made her look sleepy because they are half-closed.<br/>
Her petite body looks delicate, but that body is carrying a large and heavy looking rucksack that looked like she could enter herself into it. Her face is composed despite that.<br/>
Each of her hand is holding to the bag’s shoulder belt. The girl doesn’t look like she is carrying any weapon that stood out.<br/>
「I carried out my work as a supporter. Besides, if the reward I receive is subtracted with the necessary expenses like the items I prepared and the like, the left-over will only be a meager amount. I’m asking you to pay the amount that was promised.」<br/>
Her tone is strong-willed, or rather it’s apathetic.<br/>
A vein formed on the haughty young man’s forehead and he fell silent. Then the staff member interrupted.<br/>
「Don’t you speak rudely like that! You were able to do work with this noble young master. Having him remember you for the future──」<br/>
However that girl doesn’t back away. No, she is in a situation where she can’t back away.<br/>
「I was made to participate in this half forcefully because of the guild’s request. This is the third time. I also have my livelihood to think about.」<br/>
The petite girl’s way of speaking irritated the staff member this time.<br/>
The Sixth is laughing.<br/>
"Even though she is small she’s got quite the mouth to her. But, she is making too many enemies like that. She is a clumsy type in her way of living."<br/>
Sophia-san opened her mouth.<br/>
「From their talk, that girl isn’t in the wrong. Why is something like this……」<br/>
Then the haughty young man raised his voice, drew out his sword and pointed it at the girl. The girl twitched in reaction.<br/>
Her sleep looking eyes opened wider, even so she doesn’t move from that place.<br/>
「So you won’t listen to me! I used you just because you’re a bit famous. A one-armed brat like you should be satisfied with just that!」<br/>
One-armed. Hearing that I looked at the girl’s left arm. I used the Second’s Art and focused on the girl’s arm. What I saw is──<br/>
「……artificial arm?」<br/>
The arm that I thought looked like a suit of armor’s left arm is an artificial arm. But, that hand is firmly gripping her bag’s shoulder belt.<br/>
It’s not just an unmovable artificial arm.<br/>
I’m curious how it moved, but my body moved before that.<br/>
Then the Third made fun of me.<br/>
"Eh? You’re going to get involved? The opponent is a noble with high pride, don’t you think it’s better to not do that? If you want to help her than it doesn’t need to be now──"<br/>
But before the Third finished speaking, my arm got caught and I stopped.<br/>
When I turned around, Novem is shaking her head.<br/>
「Lyle-sama, we shouldn’t get involved when we don’t really know the situation. Besides, that girl is no good.」<br/>
The 「no good」 that Novem said──that is also a big problematic point of her.<br/>
Novem is perfect and really reliable but, she is an owner of a harem idea. She is trying to put women around me. What’s more, because the Walt House has requirements when taking a wife, she is choosing women who fulfill those family precepts to put at my side.<br/>
In fact she already put two people……Aria-san and Sophia-san around me.<br/>
I cannot understand that side of Novem.<br/>
「It doesn’t matter if she is no good or not. I…….. Enough, I’ll go.」<br/>
I stopped explaining and shook off Novem’s arm. When I approached the noisy group, everyone’s gaze gathered on me.<br/>
Without stopping I kicked away the sword the haughty young man is holding.<br/>
「Wha-! What’s with you! Who do you think I am! I’m the son of a Viscount house that is serving in the palace. How dare you do such thing to──」<br/>
I looked at the man and spoke apathetically.<br/>
「If you have formed a contract, then you should carry it out to the letter. Did she demand the wrong amount from you?」<br/>
The face of the haughty young man twitched at my words.<br/>
「Who is going to pay several gold coins to a mere supporter huh!? Silver coin is enough for her!」<br/>
The young man’s face went red. In contrast the Third is laughing.<br/>
"This is why capital nobles are bothersome. This is why I hate them. Lyle, say this to him……so even a son of a capital noble feels that several gold coins is too much to pay is it?, like that."<br/>
Nobles are largely divided into two categories.<br/>
Nobles that are acting as feudal lords in the provinces, and nobles that are serving the king in the palace. But, because of various things, the relation between these two kinds of nobles is bad.<br/>
It seems it’s also the same for the Walt House.<br/>
「Is the honorable son of a splendid Viscount house feeling it too much to pay several gold coins?」<br/>
The face of the haughty young man became even redder hearing those words. His blood vessel on his forehead was becoming even more visible. I’m worried that his vein will burst from him getting too agitated.<br/>
At the same time laughing voices came from the surroundings. The onlooker adventurers are laughing at my words.<br/>
The haughty young man who thought that he is getting laughed at took out gold coins from his wallet.<br/>
「Do, don’t look down on me! I’ll give you this if you want it that much!」<br/>
The girl gathered up the gold coins that were thrown to the floor, then she took out silver coins and bronze coins from her own wallet and handed it to the haughty young man.<br/>
「What is it now!?」<br/>
The haughty young man is irritated from me making fun of him and also getting laughed at on top of that.<br/>
「The reward is too much with this amount, so here is the change.」<br/>
In other words, she is saying that she won’t accept more than the promised reward. But, the haughty young man slapped away the girl’s hand.<br/>
「Who needs that, don’t look down on me!」<br/>
He spat those words and then the group left the guild. After that the surroundings gave applause. However, the staff member immediately glared at the onlookers to shut them up before looking at us and yelling angrily.<br/>
「Just what have you done! That person is a noble! Even though I had especially introduced him to you……think more about your position next time!」<br/>
The staff member walked with large strides and returned to inside the guild. We’re see off his back with a dumbfounded look, and then the girl bowed her head to me.<br/>
「Thank you very much.」<br/>
「Ah, no, such thing is」<br/>
I’m a bit embarrassed getting thanked like this. It feels good doing good things……is what I’m thinking but,<br/>
「But──」<br/>
The girl lifted her head and warned me.<br/>
「The situation just now……I believe that you shouldn’t get involved with me.」<br/>
The person I helped said 「shouldn’t get involved」, I definitely heard her saying that.<br/>
.<br/>
We changed places to a restaurant that is located distantly from the guild.<br/>
The guild is established right beside the gate of the outer wall. The traffic of people coming and going is heavy and the dust cloud there is terrible. Because there is a horse stable nearby, the smell of animals and animal waste made the condition there really unsuitable for talking.<br/>
The girl I helped, Clara Bulmer said that she wants to show her gratitude and showed us to this restaurant.<br/>
Seeing how many adventurers there are in this restaurant, it’s clear that this restaurant is popular among adventurers.<br/>
What Clara who guided us to this place said is──<br/>
「The one with the most authority in Arumsaas is the academy. The people who are called professors there also carry out the management of the city. Although, it seems the professors doing the city management aren’t even half of their number.」<br/>
Clara-san is giving a simple explanation of the situation in Arumsaas. It seems that normally she wouldn’t act like the attitude she showed at the guild. The same thing has happened to her several times until now. Each time it happened she said that she would cry herself to sleep.<br/>
「The next one with authority are the nobles. Arumsaas is an academy city, so their official stance is that they came here to endeavor in their pursuit of knowledge. It is said that many of the academy students are young nobles because they want to raise their prestige by studying here. Well, the majority of them are only playing around in here though.」<br/>
The young nobles who cannot inherit their house can obtain jobs in the royal court by saying that they had studied in Arumsaas. Or they would become independent and found their own house.<br/>
They can also make connections by getting acquainted with the heirs of the noble houses that enrolled to the academy. It’s also not impossible to marry into a noble house through their connection here. It seems that the academy is also a convenient place for that kind of encounter.<br/>
Recently many of that kind of young noble became Clara-san’s employer. This time too the guild half forced her to take the job.<br/>
Because of that she was unable to receive proper rewards and got troubled. This seems to be the reason for the situation just now.<br/>
As expected, if it happened that she couldn’t receive a proper reward multiple times, she won’t be able to live. And so, only this time she argued with her employer. It seems that she herself understood that she was doing something she isn’t used to that she normally wouldn’t do.<br/>
While we’re talking about that, Clara-san is eating a lot of the lined up food one after another. Where is she putting up all those food in her small body? I can’t help but find it mysterious.<br/>
「And the last is the adventurer guild. The characteristic of the Arumsaas guild is their extremely weak position towards the academy and the nobles.」<br/>
Aria-san is feeling surprised at the amount Clara-san ate while asking a question.<br/>
「Isn’t it strange for them to make light of adventurers because of that? They won’t be able to obtain magic stones and materials without us, they should treat us with more care……」<br/>
Clara-san used the napkin on the table to wipe the stain on her mouth.<br/>
「There is a dungeon in Arumsaas. This city is profiting enough from the magic stones and materials obtained from there. The academy is employing their own combat group to enter the dungeon, so the adventurers here tend to get belittled. They only think of the adventurers going out to gather magic stones as mere extras. I think it’s even to the degree they grumble that adventurers earning money outside in summer and winter as not doing their job.」<br/>
The Seventh seems happy listening to that explanation.<br/>
"That’s right. It’s the height of folly to leave a dungeon that has to be managed only to the guild and adventurers. They said that there is no feudal lord in Arumsaas but, in spite of that it’s making a very correct decision."<br/>
Sophia-san tilted her head.<br/>
「In other words, you’re saying that the guild won’t really be troubled even without us here?」<br/>
Clara-san corrected Sophia-san’s interpretation.<br/>
「To be more precise, as long as there are adventurers who are able to enter the dungeon. Although, they won’t say that other adventurers are unneeded, but they will think of them as mere extras. Even if they don’t do anything a lot of adventurers will still gather here, so the guild doesn’t need to make any effort to keep adventurers from leaving. Well, the problem is that the parties that have grown skilled are leaving Arumsaas one after another.」<br/>
Arumsaas’s adventurer guild seems to have a lot of problems one way or another.<br/>
「Even the qualifications to enter dungeon, the guild will recommend adventurers who will be judged by the academy and it’s the academy who decides whether to give permission or not. But……from the academy’s viewpoint, the young nobles are students, but at the same time they’re also existences that will use a lot of money in the city.」<br/>
The way the explanation is going is becoming ominous.<br/>
「If you all are thinking to enter the dungeon, it’s a mistake to have helped me at that place. After all by doing that you incurred the displeasure of the guild and the nobles.」<br/>
Novem concluded the talk after hearing that.<br/>
「In other words, you are saying that now it has become difficult for us to enter the dungeon.」<br/>
Clara-san nodded, and then she expressed her feelings towards me.<br/>
「I honestly feel happy that you helped me out, I’ll also thank you. Thank you very much. But, if you’re thinking about the future then as expected it’s a problem for all of you to turn the guild and nobles into enemies. Do you have some kind of connection with the academy?」<br/>
I powerlessly shook my head.<br/>
The Third’s provocative voice came from inside the Jewel.<br/>
"It became a big trouble now after you went against Novem-chan like a kid in his rebellious age. But, this too is you reaping what you sow……you’ve got to do something about it by yourself."<br/>
Clara-san sighed while giving me a suggestion. She added 「I can’t really recommend this but」 at the beginning.<br/>
「If you want to enter the dungeon as fast as possible, then as expected perhaps it will be faster to approach a noble. I can enter the dungeon by asking my acquaintances so I can go together with them, but I personally don’t have the qualifications for it. Besides, most of my acquaintances are also not thinking of increasing the number of their members, so I can’t introduce you to them. Here you should ask for a request from a noble who is an academy student.」<br/>
The method that Clara-san taught me is to accept a noble’s request. And from there I’ll have to become personally acquainted with that noble.<br/>
「A noble’s request?」<br/>
Clara-san nodded.<br/>
「Yes. All the academy’s students have the qualification to enter the dungeon. If you can have a noble take a liking to you and they hire your party as guards then……but, if you pick the wrong person」<br/>
Novem sighed.<br/>
「It might become like what happened to Clara-san.」<br/>
「Yes. That’s why, I don’t really recommend that. There are decent people among them but, I really cannot say that all of them are decent people. I’ll also cooperate with all of you as much as I can but, I’m just a supporter who is doing freelance most of the time. So perhaps I won’t really be reliable.」<br/>
Clara-san is an adventurer who specialized as a supporter. She won’t fight but, her role is mainly to carry the baggage and support her comrades by doing other work for them.
