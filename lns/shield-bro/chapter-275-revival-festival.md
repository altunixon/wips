Chapter 275: Revival Festival<br/>
A little while after the Heroes held their conference.<br/>
Recently, Ren’s curse’s effects have been lessening. His loss of luck, and his decrease in EXP has gone below levels where we have to worry about it.<br/>
The Status reduction from my curse is almost trivial as well.<br/>
There’s around one month left until the next wave…<br/>
Imya’s uncle was quite a skilled craftsman,and he’s been making weapons and armor for everyone.<br/>
As his disciple, Ren and his group are going around the country looking for materials.<br/>
Now, the villagers have become quite strong. The Granny also carries out training to increase their combat abilities as high as possible.<br/>
Isn’t it about time for me to go raise my level as well? I guess I should go on a quest to some monster infested dungeon or something.<br/>
As I was thinking that…<br/>
"Revival Festival?" (Naofumi)<br/>
Melty came to my place carrying a stack of documents.<br/>
"Yeah." (Melty)<br/>
"What’s that supposed to mean?" (Naofumi)<br/>
"Well, we’ve pretty much finished reviving the villages, and we resolved the Three Hero Church brainwashing incident, right?" (Melty)<br/>
"Hmm… Do we have the time to be doing such things?" (Naofumi)<br/>
Houou will attack in one month’s time. Should we really be holding a festival?<br/>
Is what I think, but in a world like this one, it’s probably best to have fun while you have the time.<br/>
"Then just go and hold one by yourself." (Naofumi)<br/>
"Are you sure? If you joined, you could expect quite a bit of profit." (Melty)<br/>
"How much?" (Naofumi)<br/>
"If you want a rough estimation, about this much." (Melty)<br/>
Melty presents a numerical estimate to me.<br/>
It was an absurd amount.<br/>
"Why this much?" (Naofumi)<br/>
"Because we’re going to host quite a few attractions, and we’ll be managing a bit of healthy betting." (Melty)<br/>
Gambling.<br/>
I don’t hate that sort of thing.<br/>
Don’t get me wrong. I hate participating in it.<br/>
I enjoy gambling others out of their money.<br/>
But that presents a problem.<br/>
"Isn’t that dangerous?" (Naofumi)<br/>
"There’s no problems. We’re planning some Filo Rial races similar to the ones at the Coliseum. Naofumi’s place has an abundance of good steeds." (Melty)<br/>
(TL: Melty uses a word to describe good racing horses here.)<br/>
So we’re using the Filo Rials.<br/>
I get the feeling they’re living sedentary lives, so perhaps an event like this is a good opportunity.<br/>
"We’re having other people challenge them. The earnings will definitely be great." (Melty)<br/>
"…Fumu. Got it." (Naofumi)<br/>
"We also have a music show by Firo-chan planned." (Melty)<br/>
"Music?" (Naofumi)<br/>
"Yeah, Firo-chan’s had experience singing in bars. She’s become quite famous by word of mouth. If you find her, go call out to her." (Melty)<br/>
Yes, Firo’s definitely good at singing.<br/>
If there’s music playing, she can make words and tunes to complement the song perfectly, and she’s got a nice sense of rhythm.<br/>
She also likes dancing, and in human form, she’s a bishojo.<br/>
It’s as if she’s a…<br/>
"She seems to have a lot of fans. Last time Firo sang in the village bar, the bar was so packed that no one could fit through the door anymore." (Melty)<br/>
"Is she some sort of Idol?" (Naofumi)<br/>
"Some people even settle in that village for Firo-chan. Painters have sent in requests to use her as a model. Should I permit them? I think we’ll be able to rake in quite a bit." (Melty)<br/>
I can’t wait to see what sort of face Motoyasu will make.<br/>
Will he snap, and try to monopolize Firo?<br/>
No, his wallet will probably go to the great bin in the sky as he buys all her merchandise.<br/>
"In this case, should we open up a photography session, and sell each photo crystal for 1 gold?" (Melty)<br/>
"Fumu. That sounds good." (Naofumi)<br/>
Excess gold is never a problem.<br/>
I’ve started instating small taxes in the village as well, so my finances are rising.<br/>
Well, making Imya’s Uncle’s workshop, miscellaneous costs relating to weapons and armor, maintaining Rat’s equipment, procuring medicine, and a lot of other things have cut it by quite a bit.<br/>
Still, Melty plans to exploit her best friend to earn money…<br/>
It seems she hasn’t realized it herself, but she definitely carries the blood of her parents.<br/>
No, she’s creating a place for Firo to shine… If you look at her like a Producer, I guess she’s trying to benefit her friend.<br/>
"Got it. The merchant association has already began progress, so we should be able to hold it in around three days." (Melty)<br/>
"Should I participate as well?" (Naofumi)<br/>
"You’re the lord, so that goes without saying. Though things should proceed just fine as long as you signal the opening and closing." (Melty)<br/>
"Understood. You can permit any event that guarantees profit." (Naofumi)<br/>
And stuff happened, and three days passed.<br/>
"Then the Revival Festival will henceforth commence!" (Naofumi)<br/>
A grand opening ceremony was held in the town plaza, and the Revival Festival began.<br/>
The neighboring town’s started expanding on a large scale, and it’s becoming a town of magnitude second to only the Castle Town.<br/>
I’m amazed that it’s made this much progress in the two months since its founding.<br/>
Even though it was supposed to have suffered quite a bit of damages from the Three Hero Church brainwashing incident…<br/>
Well, the damaged buildings have all been supplemented with Camping Plants, so it’s more of a temporary town.<br/>
The people give a loud applause in response to the starting signal.<br/>
I haven’t heard a single good thing about this country’s state of affairs.<br/>
Perhaps attractions like these are good for the people to vent off steam<br/>
"Then Firo will sing~!" (Firo)<br/>
Melty nods, and Firo races onto the special stage we erected for this event, in special clothes we prepared for it.<br/>
"YEAH!" (Crowd)<br/>
A cheer much greater than the previous one echoes through the area.<br/>
As I look over the people, I see many of them reminiscent of Idol Groupies I saw only too often in my world scattered here and there.<br/>
Hold on… Just how many fans does that bird have?<br/>
Are those people behind her musicians?<br/>
A large number of people carrying instruments begin playing to match Firo’s song.<br/>
The instruments seem to be gentle harp-like ones, but somehow, I get the feeling of a live concert here.<br/>
"L. O. V. E. Love Me! Firo-tan!" (Motoyasu)<br/>
… Behind all of the fans, Motoyasu is waving around a flag.<br/>
I feel disgusted.<br/>
Oh, the people around him are Kuu, Marin and Midori, I think.<br/>
The three Filo Rials are staring into space with extremely bored expressions on their faces.<br/>
The contrast in enthusiasm between them and Motoyasu is amazing.<br/>
"Ah… It’s good to be alive."<br/>
"Since the first time we layed ears on Firo-tan’s singing, we couldn’t work up our motivation to do work until we heard it again."<br/>
"Yeah, who cares about Humans and Demi-Humans. We’re all simply people united in listening to her voice. "<br/>
This was an unexpected result.<br/>
Because of my orders, fighting between races has stopped. I was also trying to end discrimination, but it seems some people have completely abandoned their discriminatory mindsets to pursue Firo.<br/>
Are they saying that whilst knowing her true form?<br/>
"Ah, I hope the curse that turned Firo-tan into a divine bird gets dispelled soon. We’re praying for you, Firo-tan!"<br/>
… They’re under the impression that she’s under a curse.<br/>
How convenient.<br/>
When I asked Melty later, she said that Firo’s backstory was arbitrarily decided by the fans.<br/>
Aparently she has to act as an idol and earn money in order to break her curse… or something.<br/>
It’s a setting that seems possible for a certain TS Idol protagonist. (TL: Apparently an Idol Pretender reference.)<br/>
Though in truth, her true form is the bird one, people.<br/>
"Now, everyone! Let’s cheer with all our might!"<br/>
"Yeah~!" (Crowd)<br/>
The village plaza’s completely become a concert hall.<br/>
Hmm? In a distant corner, a person wearing worn out clothing is cheering for Firo as well.<br/>
I quietly leave the plaza.<br/>
"Firo’s popularity is amazing." (Raphtlaia)<br/>
Raphtalia breaks out of the crowd, and follows behind me.<br/>
I nod honestly at her statement.<br/>
"That’s true. Melty told me beforehand, but the sales of her goods are also quite something." (Naofumi)<br/>
Since he was convinced they would sell, the accessory merchant started producing and selling official Firo goods.<br/>
He set the price quite high, but with that many fans, they’ll sell out in no time.<br/>
With this much popularity, perhaps we can have a handshake event, and charge one gold per time.<br/>
And finally, we can start producing dakimakura… or not.<br/>
"Ah… If I were to buy this… tomorrow’s food will…"<br/>
The person in the worn down robes hesitates over his purchase<br/>
He obviously has not the financing… value your life more, dude.<br/>
It’s not my problem if you starve.<br/>
By the way, I was informed afterwords that Motoyasu’s three stole the stage and did a concert of their own.<br/>
Firo’s show became really heated.<br/>
"It seems today’s going to get really hectic." (Naofumi)<br/>
The people from my village wanted to participate as well, so they’ve taken various jobs…<br/>
It seems that Kiel’s stall is quite crowded.<br/>
What was she selling again?<br/>
When I look over, I see it’s a crepe stand.<br/>
"Ah, Nii-chan!" (Kiel)<br/>
"Oy, you knew how to make crepes?" (Naofumi)<br/>
"Of course!" (Kiel)<br/>
An excited Kiel, in dog form, dexterously handles the crepe skins on the pan. She’s selling them with the slaves usually on kitchen duty.<br/>
Hmph. I thought she was growing to be a gluttonous battle maniac, but she was able to cook as well.<br/>
I never expected to find a girly aspect in her at this point.<br/>
"Using Nii-chan’s crepe as a base, and adding new ideas, this is my original crepe." (Kiel)<br/>
And what Kiel brought out was grilled fish…<br/>
She cuts the body into a texture like canned tuna, adds on sliced Bioplant fruit, and wraps it into the crepe skin.<br/>
"Crepes aren’t just dessert, you know." (Kiel)<br/>
"Ah, yes, yes." (Naofumi)<br/>
That sort of crepe existed in my world as well, so it’s not like I find it surprising.<br/>
It’s a way of cooking befitting of Kiel.<br/>
"Imya-chan’s also opened up a store." (Raphtalia)<br/>
In the Bazaar area, I found the stall Imya had opened.<br/>
The walls were lined with clothes she made especially for this day.<br/>
After appraising them, I find they are all of High Quality. Even so, the price is reasonable, and they’re selling like hot cakes.<br/>
"Ah, Hero of the Shield-sama." (Imya)<br/>
"If they’re selling this well, why not raise the price?" (Naofumi)<br/>
"But the cost of production was quite low, so selling it at any more than this would make me feel…" (Imya)<br/>
"Ah, so it’s about virtue. But the cost of your work itself needs to be included, so you should charge higher. Take note of that." (Naofumi)<br/>
"Yes." (Imya)<br/>
She’s quite an obedient child.<br/>
Raphtalia is carefully inspecting the cheap clothing. Wait, that’s underwear.<br/>
I feel like I’m looking at something I shouldn’t be.<br/>
It’s that. The feeling I would get if I enter a lingerie shop. Perhaps.<br/>
"Is there anything you want?" (Imya)<br/>
"Let’s see. Can you use slightly better materials to raise the defense?" (Raphtalia)<br/>
"Um… Does underwear need defense? For Raphtalia-san, I would recommend these ones." (Imya)<br/>
And what Imya brought out was bright red… Victory Panties?<br/>
(TL: It’s stuff you wear when you wanna get lucky.)<br/>
There’s a hole in a strange area.<br/>
"Why are you selling something like that, Imya?" (Naofumi)<br/>
"Ah, yes. Master told me that these items would be in high demand, so it would be beneficial to stock them. I have something for Hero of the Shield-sama as well." (Imya)<br/>
"…Why is there a hole in the one you’re recommending me as well?" (Naofumi)<br/>
And this one is around the anal region.<br/>
Even for a tailed Demi-Human, the placing is strange.<br/>
"That’s odd… Master said the Hero of the Shield-sama would want something like this…" (Imya)<br/>
Damn Tailor. Just how rotten is her brain?<br/>
And for such depravity to exist in this alternate world where such a genre shouldn’t exist yet…<br/>
How frightening. The Tailor is a genius. That wasn’t a compliment.<br/>
Let me just declare this. If she were to come to my world, she would have no problems putting food on the table.<br/>
"Does it not look cool to you?" (Imya)<br/>
"Imya… I’m definitely raising you in a way that you won’t learn that garment’s true meaning." (Naofumi)<br/>
"…? Understood." (Imya)<br/>
"Naofumi-sama! If I were to wear this, what would you think!?" (Raphtalia)<br/>
Raphtalia inquires with an excited expression. She’s holding the Victory Panties.<br/>
No matter how I look at it, she’s still a child on the inside. For her to see such a stimulating item, there’s no helping if she gets strangely excited.<br/>
"Raphtalia is already good looking, so I don’t think you have to dress up with things like that." (Naofumi)<br/>
"Is that true!? Wait, Naofumi-sama?" (Raphtalia)<br/>
"I think Raphtalia would do fine with a normal pair. How about it?" (Naofumi)<br/>
I point to a pair of undergarments similar to the one she usually wears.<br/>
"Um, Naofumi-sama. This may sound slightly rude, but you’re not getting aroused at all?" (Raphtalia)<br/>
"Meaning?" (Naofumi)<br/>
Is it like a daughter asking their father?<br/>
I think it would be best for her to look natural, rather than wearing those overly-stimulating items.<br/>
"Ah, never mind. You don’t have to answer that one." (Raphtalia)<br/>
Before I can say anything, Raphtalia puts the underwear back.<br/>
What’s wrong?<br/>
Did she guess my intentions?<br/>
It helps that Raphtalia’s so understanding.<br/>
