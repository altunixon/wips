Hello, this is Norva, I’m sorry for the long absence… and I have some bad news and good news for you guys……The bad news is, I appreciate if there anyone who wants to continue this translation because of I hardly have some free time to do the translation anymore…..However, don’t be sad yet, because if there nobody gonna continues this translation, I will continue to translate it but in a mass quantity of episode like I did in this volume 4.<br/>
Note:<br/>
Aa = Yeah, right, got it and used when you agree with something/someone.<br/>
Un = Colloquial way of saying “yes” and is closer to the English word “yeah”<br/>
Umu = I see, hmm<br/>
Onii-san = Elder brother<br/>
Onee-san = Elder sister<br/>
