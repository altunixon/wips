17-32. World Crisis (2)<br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
Satou here. I have been on the receiving end of a table flip at the final stage because I did not confirm what our client wanted. But thanks to those experiences, I never forgot to ask during the meeting with our clients, reducing frequency of such tragedies.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
◇<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
"We will protect Aze-sama!"<br/>
"Un, Shiro. We will definitely carry out the mission masita gave us."<br/>
<br/>
Two reliable guards stand before Aze-san.<br/>
The wingkin little girls, Shiro and Crow in the latest version of silver equipment.<br/>
<br/>
『Cheeky little--』<br/>
『Beat? Let's beat them up?』<br/>
<br/>
And it's not the demon god that's pointing their blades at Shiro and Crow, but pink-haired little girls, demon god's familiars. Those little girls are brandishing purple-colored equipment including giant scythes.<br/>
<br/>
Since there have been a lot of traffic in and out of Solitary Island Palace lately, they must have invaded by matching their timing.<br/>
<br/>
『Who's this Aze anyway?』<br/>
『That high elf maybe?』<br/>
『Who--, cares--』<br/>
<br/>
--Hm?<br/>
<br/>
Are they not here to kidnap Aze-san as ordered by Demon God?<br/>
<br/>
That was when Core Two rushed in.<br/>
Along with the green infant dragon, not sure how they got through the gate.<br/>
<br/>
"Shiro, Crow! I brought infant dragon with me!"<br/>
<br/>
--ＫＹＥＷＷＲＯＵＵＵＮ.<br/>
--Pipiru! Piru! Piru!<br/>
--Chuiiiiiii!<br/>
--Kaaaaaa.<br/>
<br/>
Looking again, they're also with the godbird Hisui, and the sage mice Raven Riders.<br/>
Unlike the green dragon, you lot will be in a serious bind if you get hurt so please get back.<br/>
<br/>
『Gyaa, it's a dragon!』<br/>
『I hate those things, they bite!』<br/>
『Geez, and we found no egg girl and no demon lords here.』<br/>
『Let's head back before it bites us!』<br/>
『Un, let's!』<br/>
<br/>
The pink-haired little girls seemed to be afraid of dragons, they rushed back into the gate they used to invade while falling onto themselves.<br/>
<br/>
My little clone jumps out of Aze-san's shadow and speaks.<br/>
<br/>
"Are you alright, Aze-san?"<br/>
"Yes, all thanks to these children protecting me."<br/>
<br/>
'Ehehe', Shiro and Crow laughed, after thanking them and the slightly triumphant looking Core Two, infant dragon, Hisui and sage mice, I asked them to keep guarding Aze-san.<br/>
<br/>
Apparently Demon God is targeting reincarnated people like Arisa and demon lords like Shizuka.<br/>
<br/>
He's probably trying to retrieve the [God's Fragments] he handed out to them during their reincarnations.<br/>
<br/>
Arisa and the former sword demon lord foxkin girl have my little clones on standby so they're fine, but Shizuka is shutting herself in the sub-space and won't come out, while the squirrel Hamsaemon and the retired former rat demon lord Nezu-san that are in the same sub-space have had their [God's Fragments] removed when they stop being demon lords, so they should be fine.<br/>
<br/>
The ones in danger would be the reincarnated people in labyrinth's lower layer, the vampire progenitor Ban, little oni princess Yuika, [Iron Stalker] Armor, and [King Mummy] Corpse, four of them--no, and one more.<br/>
<br/>
The reincarnated person, Kei who's working as an apprentice priestess of Zaikuon Temple at Makiwa Kingdom.<br/>
I've gotta instruct the member dispatched to Makiwa Kingdom to guard Kei.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
◇<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
"Lyuryu, rout them up nodesu!"<br/>
<br/>
--ＬＹＵＲＹＵＲＹＵＵＵ.<br/>
<br/>
Pochi and her dragon steed, Lyuryu, are overwhelming their opponents at Makiwa Kingdom.<br/>
She's already done dealing with the stampedes at the capital and four neighboring points, and now she's going around demolishing the purple towers' stampedes at various locations.<br/>
<br/>
Pochi was quickly done dealing with this one also, so I talk to Pochi via my little clone hiding in her shadow.<br/>
<br/>
"Pochi, I need your help to protect Kei."<br/>
"Yes nanodesu. --Where is Kei at nodesu?"<br/>
"Lyuryu's wings will take you there."<br/>
<br/>
I asked through my little clone.<br/>
<br/>
After getting the direction from me, Pochi pointed Lyuryu's nose toward it.<br/>
Kei should be fine now.<br/>
<br/>
I changed my consciousness to the little clone attached to Hikaru.<br/>
<br/>
"Hikaru, I need you to do something."<br/>
"OK. Where should I go help?"<br/>
<br/>
Looks like Hikaru is done already dealing with the stampedes at Bishtal Dukedom, she's currently patrolling around the central small country group.<br/>
<br/>
"Please deliver a warning to the reincarnated people living in the labyrinth's lower layer."<br/>
"That's fine with me, but wouldn't it be better to do that through Arisa-chan's Telephone?"<br/>
"That place's got Yuika's barrier up, you see."<br/>
"Ah, guess Telephone won't reach them then."<br/>
<br/>
She's quick to catch on thankfully.<br/>
<br/>
"Getting there from here would be a hassle. Need me to ask Arisa for a shortcut?"<br/>
"Ahaha, I'll be fine. I can go reasonably fast by making good use of acceleration circles. That aside, can I count on you to take care of the countries around here?"<br/>
"Ah, I'm going to ask Tama who's been dispatched to the southern part of Saga Empire to deal with things here."<br/>
"Ah with Cat Ninja Tama on the case, there's nothing to worry about then."<br/>
<br/>
After saying that, Hikaru produced acceleration circles mid air and flew off in the direction of labyrinth city.<br/>
<br/>
『--It's here.』<br/>
『--It's here.』<br/>
<br/>
Reports from little clones attached to the former sword demon lord and Arisa.<br/>
<br/>
After hesitating for a bit, I changed my consciousness to the little clone attached to Arisa.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
◇<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
"Fuhahaha, where do you think you're going to, huh."<br/>
<br/>
『『『Unyaa!』』』<br/>
『『『Bully demon lord is scary--』』』<br/>
『『『We're gonna tell milord on you!』』』<br/>
<br/>
Arisa wearing sunglasses on top of her golden helmet is chasing around the purple-armored pink-haired little girls while laughing loudly.<br/>
I understood that reference, but please don't forget that we're facing a world crisis right about now.<br/>
<br/>
"Oh my, Master. I haven't forgotten you know. Since there were nothing but mobs, I've put <<Vortex Traps>> around all the towers I'm in charge with. There should be almost nothing left of the enemy by now, I think?"<br/>
<br/>
I see, so she was ambushed by these little girls during a downtime.<br/>
<br/>
"Should I go capture one of them?"<br/>
"Nah, we don't want to attract Demon God's attention. Did you remember to check out their goals?"<br/>
"Oh yes, I sure did. Those girls are going for the Authorities (Unique Skills) given to us by demon god, they're apparently collecting it for the sake of Demon God."<br/>
"--For the sake of Demon God?"<br/>
"Un, it sounds super bad."<br/>
<br/>
Must be the Disintegration Factor booby trap inserted by those gods--.<br/>
<br/>
『『『Retreating for now--』』』<br/>
<br/>
The little girls ran away.<br/>
<br/>
"Ah, they ran off. How is it coming along on your side, Master?"<br/>
"It should be be done by sunset today."<br/>
"I see, so the last battle ground will still be at the highest purple tower near Saga Empire's [Hero's Labyrinth]?"<br/>
"Yeah, no change in plan as of now."<br/>
<br/>
After telling her my progress, I changed consciousness to the little clone dispatched to the former sword demon lord.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<TLN: If you're reading this novel at any other site than Sousetsuka .com you might be reading an unedited, uncorrected version of the novel.><br/>
◇<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
"You ought to train more degozaru."<br/>
<br/>
『『『Kyu~』』』<br/>
<br/>
The former sword demon lord, foxkin girl said in triumphant as she trampled down the dizzy pink-haired little girls.<br/>
Just like Arisa, her demon lord form has come undone, but her Unique Skills--[God's Fragments] are still residing in her. <br/>
<br/>
『An openiiiiing!』<br/>
<br/>
A pink-haired little girl swung down a huge scythe from behind the former sword demon lord.<br/>
<br/>
The scythe's blade looked as if it had successfully cut the former demon lord's body in two, but then her body faded before turning into light brown fur.<br/>
<br/>
"That is but an illusion degozaru."<br/>
<br/>
She failed to learn Primeval Magic like the beastkin girls, but in exchange, she managed to use the illusion art passed down in foxkin family a bit.<br/>
She told me that she could only produce one illusion of herself for a short period of time, but I think it's more than potent enough paired with her swordsmanship.<br/>
<br/>
『Migyaa』<br/>
"Judgment, degozaru."<br/>
<br/>
The little girl that was hit by the sword's hilt got beaten down to the ground.<br/>
She's probably not gonna die with just that much, but the scene reeks of crime, visually speaking.<br/>
<br/>
"You can let them go if you're done with their chastisement."<br/>
"Ui, I got it degozaru."<br/>
<br/>
I gave an instruction to the former sword demon lord through the little clone.<br/>
<br/>
『Don't think you've won yet!』<br/>
『Right right!』<br/>
『We won't lose next time, you hear us.』<br/>
<br/>
The little girls freed by the former sword demon lord cursed out.<br/>
<br/>
"I welcome a revenge match any time degozaru."<br/>
<br/>
Noticing former sword demon lord battle junkiness from her reaction, "I can even go at it now", the little girls ran off toward a magic circle they produced to flee, "Noo, no more."<br/>
<br/>
How do I say it, it's like watching subordinates getting pushed around by their superior.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
◇<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Since Hikaru seemed to have arrived at the labyrinth's lower layer, I changed my consciousness to the little clone lurking in her shadow.<br/>
<br/>
"So even Ancestor King Yamato is used as a gofer now eh?"<br/>
"Ahaha, Satou doesn't think that at all."<br/>
"Hyo hyo hyo, that's just how all men are like, y'know?"<br/>
<br/>
They seem to be at [King Mummy] Corpse's domain.<br/>
<br/>
She's talking to the master of the domain, Corpse and his sworn friend, [Iron Stalker] Armor.<br/>
<br/>
"But still, how did you maintain the same looks as you were 700 years ago despite being a human?"<br/>
"Oh but it hasn't been 700 years yet. I repaired a magically induced cold sleep facility from Furu Empire and went into a long sleep until just recently, you see."<br/>
"Cold sleep in a sword and magic world? What the heck is this SF."<br/>
<br/>
An energetic voice resounded as Armor and Hikaru chatted.<br/>
<br/>
"Corpse! I brought Ban-sama and Yuika with me!"<br/>
<br/>
Behind the vampire princess Semeri who shouted that, a tentacled creature, ropers, carrying a portable shrine with vampire progenitor Ban and little oni princess, Yuika riding on it, followed.<br/>
<br/>
"I heard you have got a business with me, who knew it was a visit by Yamato dearuka."<br/>
"Long time no see, Hikaru-san."<br/>
"Hi Yuika-cchi, last time was at the Solitary Island Palace wasn't it. And Ban, that curly hair still looks as wonderful as Rau-kun's."<br/>
"It's about time you stop praising my point of similarity with characters from shoujo manga every time we meet dearu."<br/>
<br/>
After renewing their old friendship, Hikaru got to the point.<br/>
<br/>
"--So please, be on your guard."<br/>
"Demon God coming for our fragments, dearuka..."<br/>
"Whoa, it sounds so fun above ground."<br/>
"An all out war between gods and demon god huh. --Yuika, what do you think."<br/>
"Eh, um, you mean Founder-sama? Please wait a moment."<br/>
<br/>
Suddenly getting talked to, Yuika shut her eyes.<br/>
Her expression saw a complete change when her eyes reopened.<br/>
<br/>
"There have been many signs of that from Demon God's behaviors before, I see that he finally acts on it."<br/>
"And on the outset, he is making an attempt to deprive us of our fragments dearuka."<br/>
"Hmph, he's got a big mistake if he thinks we're just gonna take it lying down without a fierce one."<br/>
"Hyo hyo hyo. How long has it been since I played with demons I wonder."<br/>
"How about we loosen up Yuika's barrier and invite them into the minefield huh."<br/>
<br/>
With a nasty smile on his face, Corpse brandished his skull wand and weakened the barrier.<br/>
<br/>
"Hyo hyo hyo, can't wait fer' it."<br/>
<br/>
"...Not having anything to do brings ruins to men dearuna."<br/>
"You tell me nanoja."<br/>
<br/>
Armor and Corpse smiled back to back, while Ban and Yuika looked astonished.<br/>
<br/>
"Armor, Corpse, you're mistaken."<br/>
<br/>
Hikaru who was late to react at the series of events corrected Armor and Corpse's misunderstanding.<br/>
<br/>
"--Mistaken?"<br/>
"Un, it's not demons that are coming, it's going to be little girls who are demon god's familiars."<br/>
"Little girls huh... I can't fight that."<br/>
"Boring. I got no interest in harassing kids."<br/>
<br/>
"Worry, not, Cerulean Blue the first, correcting dayo."<br/>
<br/>
A flat paper-like demon intruded from between the crack in the barrier Corpse was going to close.<br/>
<br/>
"Greater demon--level 63. Posses Water magic and ice magic. It uses deadly poison and plague as well, careful noja."<br/>
"Tch, just a lone level 63 eh. Corpse and Ban will gonna make a short work out of it. Lemme go first."<br/>
<br/>
"Worry, not, Cerulean Blue the second, correcting dayo."<br/>
"You guys, have no chance, Cerulean Blue the third, proclaiming dayo."<br/>
"Perish here, and return your fragments to milord. Cerulean Blue the fourth, condemning dayo."<br/>
<br/>
The flat demon unraveled into tens of demons.<br/>
Fortunately, there's only four greater demons, the remaining tens of demons appear to be support-type mid-class demons.<br/>
<br/>
"Armor, Ban, Yuika, buy me time. I'm gonna cast a forbidden spell."<br/>
"My turn first--"<br/>
<br/>
Armor took out a weird magic sword furnished with gears and protuberances.<br/>
<br/>
"<<BELLOW>> Magic Sword Machinery Heart!"<br/>
<br/>
With the activation verse recited, the gears on the magic sword began to spin as the blade transformed while making sounds.<br/>
I don't get the point of this transformation, but it's a pretty good gimmick that raises your tension high just by watching it unfolds. Had Arisa and Pochi seen this, they would definitely want to mimic it.<br/>
<br/>
"<<DANCE>> Claiomh Solais!"<br/>
<br/>
Hikaru unleashed Claiomh Solais to guard Armor while she herself began chanting the lesser version of anti-god magic to be used against demon lords.<br/>
<br/>
"Foirnis, use this."<br/>
"A jet black katana with a blood-colored line huh--my friend, Ban, you know your stuff noja."<br/>
"Hmph."<br/>
<br/>
Progenitor Ban fetched two japanese katanas from Item Box.<br/>
He handed over one of the swords while calling the soul name of Yuika to her, and drew the other, a red katana with a black line for himself.<br/>
<br/>
"Ban-sama, leave your back to me!"<br/>
<br/>
Semeri shouldering a scythe ran up to Ban's side as if emphasizing her glamorous body.<br/>
<br/>
There were several other shadows hot on her heels.<br/>
<br/>
"Audacious."<br/>
"Shiki is right! Try to score a win against us first before you claim Ban-sama's back!"<br/>
<br/>
It's the wives of Progenitor Ban, the vampire princesses.<br/>
<br/>
"Right right!"<br/>
"Hey wait, I already scored lots of wins against fatty!"<br/>
"I am not fat! Just a bit well-rounded!"<br/>
"Leave playing around for later dearu."<br/>
""YES! BAN-SAMA!""<br/>
<br/>
Warned by Ban, the vampire princesses cut up their wrists to produce blood swords before attacking the mid-class demons.<br/>
The demons skilfully used their flat bodies to evade the slashes.<br/>
<br/>
"I shan't lose to Armor and Ban noja--Divine Sight."<br/>
<br/>
Purple light swept over Yuika's body.<br/>
<br/>
"These demons' weak points are the crest on their waist nanoja! Break that point and they can no longer dodge to 2D!"<br/>
<br/>
Hearing that, the vampire princesses started aiming at the crests on the waists, felling the mid-class demons one after another.<br/>
<br/>
"As expected of my sworn friend Foirnis! 『Concentration』--Phantom Blade."<br/>
<br/>
Ban sheathed his red katana, then after a purple light swept over his body, he unleashed a draw-slash sword skill toward one of the greater demons.<br/>
<br/>
"--Water Blades."<br/>
<br/>
The greater demon produced countless swords made of water stream in an attempt to block Ban's sword.<br/>
<br/>
"Meaningless."<br/>
<br/>
Shiki who was following Ban like his shadow muttered.<br/>
As if proving her word, the stream swords got smashed into pieces, and the upper half of that greater demon got finely chopped into pieces before it could find out how.<br/>
<br/>
"Amazing as always Ban-sama!"<br/>
<br/>
Semeri jumped gleefully like it was her feat.<br/>
<br/>
"--A shallow cut dearu."<br/>
"Correct dayo. Eat counter dayo."<br/>
<br/>
The greater demon that should have been pulverized turned into a cerulean blue mist and blew away the upper half of Ban's body.<br/>
<br/>
"""BAN-SAMA!"""<br/>
"Fret not."<br/>
"Shiki is right. I mean Ban-sama is immortal after all."<br/>
<br/>
The younger vampire princesses were beside themselves worrying over Ban, while the older generation princesses including Shiki watched attentively, convinced of Ban's safety.<br/>
<br/>
"Ah! In the purple whirl!"<br/>
"Will Ban-sama's blood win, or will it greater demon's water current--"<br/>
"Pointless question."<br/>
"--Good grief. Like Ban-sama would lose against a mere greater demon."<br/>
<br/>
The vampire princesses watched over the inhuman fight between Ban and the greater demon while they clashed with the mid-class demons themselves.<br/>
<br/>
The fierce fight between water and mist finally came to a conclusion, a filthy blue water splashed down the ground.<br/>
The red water that had remained in the air turned back into Ban.<br/>
<br/>
The older vampire princesses were right, Ban came out victorious in the inhuman fight.<br/>
<br/>
"Don't think you've won just yet dayo."<br/>
"Hmph. Should you really focus fully on me dearuka?"<br/>
<br/>
Progenitor Ban spoke to the regenerated but tattered greater demon.<br/>
<br/>
At the end of his jerked chin, three of the greater demons were locked in Yuika's trick.<br/>
<br/>
"Kuhahahaha, nothing less to expect from greater demons, they even survived Death Game! Next is Death Counter nanoja!"<br/>
<br/>
Yuika is cornering the greater demons using Unique Skills which I've never seen before.<br/>
When she's this strong at her current lowered level, I can't imagine just how powerful Yuika is in her prime.<br/>
<br/>
"Come now, quickly undo your curse noja. If you don't do it in the next three seconds, your souls are gonna be broken into pieces, no matter if you're a demon noja."<br/>
<br/>
One greater demon that couldn't undo the curse in time disappeared into blue mist while wailing ghastly.<br/>
<br/>
"Yuika, I'm good now!"<br/>
<br/>
Corpse who was done reciting forbidden spell shouted.<br/>
Hikaru is about done with her chant as well.<br/>
<br/>
"I see that Corpse is done preparing. You play along with Corpse now. Out of goodness of my heart, you'd better be ready with defensive magic, hear me?"<br/>
<br/>
--ＢＺＬＵＵＵＵＵＵＵＵＵＵＵＵＸＹＥ.<br/>
--ＢＺＬＵＵＵＵＵＵＵＵＵＵＵＵＸＹＥ.<br/>
<br/>
"Gnaw upon them, <<Hell Beast Jail>>"<br/>
<br/>
Hundreds, thousands of wolf-shaped specters welled out from within darkness in ceilings and grounds, and then they rushed toward the greater demons with their ink-like lower halves.<br/>
Two of greater demons that survived their match against Yuika amassed thick blue barriers around themselves, but those barriers were quickly getting bitten down into pieces by the wolf specters.<br/>
The wolf specters eventually bit and tore the barriers down, and flooded onto their next target, the greater demons.<br/>
<br/>
The specters are gnawing on the greater demons.<br/>
<br/>
Quite a wicked magic.<br/>
No wonder it's got classified as a forbidden spell.<br/>
<br/>
--ＢＺＬＵＵＵＵＵＵＵＵＵＵＵＵＸＹＥ.<br/>
--ＢＺＬＵＵＵＵＵＵＵＵＵＵＵＵＸＹＥ.<br/>
<br/>
The demons blew apart the specters with their magic and peculiar ability, but unfortunately for them the difference in numbers is simply staggering.<br/>
No matter if a swing of their fists and tails break several wolves, no matter if their magic and peculiar ability swallow dozens of the wolves, they're up against an army of thousands.<br/>
<br/>
There's no way to repel it easily.<br/>
<br/>
"Tch, these greater demons sure are sturdy."<br/>
<br/>
Corpse's grumble is right on the money, two greater demons survived through the forbidden spell.<br/>
Only the demon that missed its chance to put up defensive barrier died by Corpse's forbidden spell.<br/>
<br/>
"Yuika, yer' gonna take responsibility for this ya hear me?"<br/>
"Aye, understood noja. But, your worry is unwarranted, no?"<br/>
<br/>
Yuika glanced at Hikaru.<br/>
<br/>
"Ban! Withdraw the vampire princesses! Yuika! Take Armor to a safe zone!"<br/>
<br/>
As instructed by Hikaru, the vampire princesses who were fighting off mid-class demons fell back, and Yuika activated her [Unparalleled Arm Strength] Unique Skill to drag the sitting Armor that had used up his stamina back.<br/>
<br/>
"Lesser Mythology Extinction."<br/>
<br/>
Hikaru's delayed anti demon lord forbidden spell burst out, the remaining two greater demons and several mid-class demons vanished beyond the flash.<br/>
<br/>
"What the heck, those demons got evaporated just like that."<br/>
"That's one amazing forbidden spell nanoja."<br/>
"First I've seen this forbidden spell dearu."<br/>
<br/>
Everyone besides Corpse clamored when they saw Hikaru's forbidden spell.<br/>
<br/>
"Yamato. That a modified version of the forbidden spell I taught Satou, yeah?"<br/>
"Un, that's right. --Interested?"<br/>
<br/>
"...Hell naw. Seeing that is enough. I'm gonna make one myself now."<br/>
"Ahaha, Corpse you haven't changed at all from back then, still really hate to lose."<br/>
<br/>
Hikaru's laughter echoed in Corpse's domain.<br/>
<br/>
This side looks to be fine.<br/>
<br/>
Next, let's check all the girls one by one starting from Lulu.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
◇<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
"Awesome, those monsters just went poof with every shot."<br/>
"The buckshot that purged the swarm in front of the rampart was already amazing, but that sniping is just something else."<br/>
<br/>
Lulu is sniping down the purple tower's vanguard monsters from on top of a tower connected to a rampart.<br/>
The wind brought murmurs from guards stationed on top of the rampart to her, yet Lulu was unaffected, she just kept sniping on.<br/>
I'm sure she's concentrating so much she couldn't hear a word.<br/>
<br/>
--Crisis Perception.<br/>
<br/>
I felt danger from a distortion in space in the sky.<br/>
Looking up, I saw something trying to come out of a purple distortion in the sky.<br/>
<br/>
"Oy! Look at that!"<br/>
<br/>
People looked up at the sky as they noticed it.<br/>
<br/>
"Demons!"<br/>
<br/>
It seems like the second round of stampedes sparked by Demon God will be an army of demons.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
