Chapter 59.1 : Tarasque<br/>
◆Dark Knight Kuroki<br/>
At the outskirts of the freedom city, Teseshia.<br/>
The sound of an explosion resounded in the plains that was slightly separated from the highway.<br/>
「I DID IT, KUROKI-SAN!」<br/>
The one who exclaimed with such a delighted voice right now was Kyouka.<br/>
She was currently firing her magic to hit the target.<br/>
After many tries, she managed to land a hit on her 36th attempt.<br/>
Though this seemed natural for other magicians, it was a huge achievement for her.<br/>
Mainly because her magic couldn’t even properly activate prior to this.<br/>
「E\~r… Midou-san. I think you can train by yourself afterwards, just to let your body get used to this sensation.」<br/>
I told Kyouka about the plan for her future training.<br/>
「You’re Kyouka’s best teacher, Kuroki-san!!!」<br/>
Kyouka grabbed my hand.<br/>
「Eh, no… I don’t think my little advice is worthy enough for you to call me as your teacher…」<br/>
I felt really embarrassed when she called me “Teacher” just now.<br/>
I mean, I simply guided her a bit, it wasn’t like I taught her some kind of heaven defying secret art.<br/>
The cue that led to all of this happened during last night’s dinner, Kyouka-san suddenly asked me out of the blue to teach her magic.<br/>
However, I personally don’t think I’m suited for that job.<br/>
At first, I turned down her request but I was forced to compromise and limit it to advising her after she sincerely bowed to me.<br/>
This led us to our current situation. We departed in the morning towards the outskirts of Teseshia for Kyouka’s training.<br/>
Kaya and Shirone tagged along with us.<br/>
Once Rena returned to Elios, it seemed that she couldn’t remain absent for any longer than this.<br/>
At present, Regena and the lizardmen were waiting on standby at Quiche river.<br/>
Novis and the others were banned from traveling outside of Teseshia, it was simply to prevent them from creating more trouble for us.<br/>
Kyouka looked for a place to practice her magic, but there was no need for that.<br/>
I mean, the reason for her failure in activating spells was simply because she injected too much mana in, it caused the magic to explode instead.<br/>
This was why I only told her to relax her shoulders when invoking a spell.<br/>
Naturally, telling her this and her actually doing it were two completely different matters.<br/>
Even when she tried lessening the amount of mana, she would still subconsciously inject too much.<br/>
If this was the root of her problem, then the only way to fix it was to let her get used to casting spells. This was a matter of feeling it proper after all. It was something that she had to realize herself.<br/>
Thus, she finally got the “feel” on her 36th try.<br/>
「Let me to try it once again, FIREBALL!」<br/>
With these words, the fireball that came out of Kyouka’s cane went in the wrong direction.<br/>
「MAGIC ERASER!」<br/>
I hurriedly erased her magic that strayed from its supposed orbit. It would be disastrous if a passerby accidentally got hit by that magic.<br/>
「Another failure…」<br/>
Kyouka slumped down. Her mood swings were basically from one extreme pole to another far end.<br/>
「I think failure is a part of the natural process. I mean, not everything goes according to your will in the real world too.  You don’t need to feel down just because you failed.」<br/>
I’m consoling Kyouka.<br/>
I felt that I needed to inform her that failure was normal in life. Someone who paved their way through hardship would do better than people who never experienced it.<br/>
「But… Onii-sama and Chiyuki-san can use magic so easily on their first try. It seems like it’s easy as breathing for them…」<br/>
Kyouka complained with a gloomy look on her face.<br/>
「It doesn’t mean that everyone can achieve such a feat on their first try. I mean, I myself failed so many times in the past…」<br/>
According to Kyouka, Reiji seemed to have been able to do everything ever since he was a child.<br/>
However, that didn’t mean everyone could be the same. Every human was born with their own gifts after all.<br/>
I mean, I wasn’t able to succeed on my first try too. My talents were a tad below Reiji’s.<br/>
However, nothing would change if you only kept envying another person.<br/>
All you could do was fight back with whatever means you had in your disposal. Any other parts that felt lacking could only be supplemented with training and more training.<br/>
This was the conclusion that I came with from my slump after I got miserably defeated by Reiji years ago.<br/>
Kyouka was clearly impatient. I mean, she was surrounded by a genius when she alone couldn’t do anything, this making her irritated.<br/>
Her approach in things was wrong from the very beginning, she should’ve taken things slowly. The more she got impatient, the more likely would fail in her attempts.<br/>
This was the lesson that I learned during my training, never be impatient.<br/>
That’s simply why I think telling this to Kyouka would make her realize that her perspective on things were wrong.<br/>
Suddenly, Kyouka made a surprised look on her face.<br/>
「Really? Even though I feel that Kuroki-san seems to be really powerful to the point that you can do anything?」<br/>
「I have no intention to become that kind of broken character. The me in the past was even weaker than Shirone… Will you believe me if I say that in the past and even until now, I still train really hard so I wouldn’t experience defeat anymore?」<br/>
I laughed as I told her about my true feelings.<br/>
I recalled that Shirone used to be stronger than me in the past, I always cried alone in the dojo while mulling over my weak self.<br/>
Even now, I still don’t really feel all that strong<br/>
After I won the fight against Reiji in front of Demon King’s Palace, it felt more like he got defeated by his own carelessness.<br/>
「No, I trust you. I mean, all I hear about you from Shirone-san are the moments when you show your uncool sides. That’s why I know you’re telling the truth.」<br/>
Kyouka was smiling this time.<br/>
I looked back at Shirone and Kaya, both were standing behind us.<br/>
Shirone turned her face to the side, she was clearly avoiding my gaze.<br/>
What was with that reaction?<br/>
「NO WAY! SHIRONE?! WHAT IN THE HELL ARE YOU TELLING OTHERS WHEN I’M NOT THERE\~!」<br/>
「Ahahahahaha! My bad, Kuroki!」<br/>
Shirone smiled apologetically.<br/>
「SHIRONE! WHAT KIND OF STORIES ABOUT MY PAST DID YOU TELL THEM?!」<br/>
「Let see\~, It’s mainly about the type of porn you hid under you bookshelves and bed…」<br/>
Shirone did her usual scratch on the cheek while looking away whenever she felt guilty about something.<br/>
「W-WAIT A MINUTE! WHERE’S MY PRIVACYYYYYYYY?!」<br/>
「AHAHAHA!」<br/>
Don’t dodge the topic with that wry smile of yours, please.<br/>
Ever since a long time ago, Shirone had always turned my bedroom upside-down.<br/>
On the other hand, she would always get pissed off whenever I tried entering her room. Isn’t that kinda unfair?<br/>
Now, look. Your stories made both Kyouka and Kaya think that I’m a pervert, right?<br/>
I tried looking at the two women’s expressions…<br/>
Kyouka didn’t really seem to be affected by it.<br/>
Kaya… was a little bit scary.<br/>
「Uhm, may I…. Ask a question for you, Kuroki-sama?」<br/>
She suddenly called out to me, I could feel the boiling anger beneath her seemingly calm voice.<br/>
「Uhm, is something…. The matter?」<br/>
I asked timidly.<br/>
「Could it be that you were looking at Milady’s certain parts with lewd thoughts in your mind during training a while ago?」<br/>
Although she was smiling while saying those words, but damn, her smile was so scary.<br/>
「N-No way! I-I definitely wouldn’t look at someone who was doing their best with those kind of lewd thoughts in my mind!」<br/>
I gave an honest answer.<br/>
I couldn’t deny the fact that Kyouka was an extremely charming woman.<br/>
Since the current weather in the western part of the continent was hotter than the eastern part, Kyouka was lightly dressed. For that reason, I couldn’t help but keep glancing at her extremely well developed chest.<br/>
However, I wasn’t lying about the part where I didn’t want to look at someone who was doing her best with a lewd gaze.<br/>
This was why I was definitely saying the truth about the fact that I wasn’t looking at her chest with lewd thoughts!<br/>
I looked into Kaya’s eyes without darting my gaze around.<br/>
「…I see. My apologies, it seems you really are telling the truth.」<br/>
Kaya bowed as she apologized to me.<br/>
「No, I don’t really mind…」<br/>
This woman called Kaya was truly caring towards Kyouka.<br/>
She kept continuously serving Kyouka even after being summoned to another world.<br/>
Their relationship wasn’t merely master and servant, they had something more special in between.<br/>
I was rather interested in learning about these two women’s relationship with each other.<br/>
「But then, that’s really amazing, Kuroki. I mean, not even Chiyuki could teach her magic, and yet, with a single advice from you, she managed to reach this level in just a short while.」<br/>
Shirone told me as she started patting my back.<br/>
To be honest, I was doing my best in suppressing this urge of mine to interrogate Shirone of her deed in telling the others about my past.<br/>
In addition, the one she referred to as Chiyuki just now might be Mizuouji Chiyuki, the one who went to the same high school as us.<br/>
She was a well known figure in our school. A woman with long and beautiful black hair.<br/>
Mizuouji Chiyuki was known as a prodigy. However, I often heard rumors about her stern personality.<br/>
Though I met her before, anyone would lose their willingness to study once they gazed into her cold, piercing eyes.<br/>
Maybe the same things happened to Kyouka. Just like becoming a swordmaster doesn’t equate to them being a good teacher, this also meant that even if a person was a prodigy, it didn’t mean that they would be good at teaching others.<br/>
According to Shirone, in fact, Chiyuki was a truly kind woman. Well, that might be true for the current Chiyuki.<br/>
It also doesn’t change the fact that she had a rather stern personality. That might be why I was so sure that Chiyuki got too scared of her eyes.<br/>
「Well, all I did was just give her some simple advice…」<br/>
It was too simple to the point that calling it ‘teaching’ was an overstatement.<br/>
All I did was tell her to relax her shoulders. I thought that she was already good enough as she was. As for the next stage of her training, people from the magician association could teach her better than me, right?<br/>
Kyouka simply feared failure too much and ended up loading too much mana when invoking her spell<br/>
And here I was, wondering why the other girls in their group didn’t teach Kyouka something as simple as this…<br/>
Then, I suddenly remembered what kind of people were around her. The women around Kyouka were those who often hung out with Reiji.<br/>
In addition, both Reiji and those girls, all of them were prodigies.<br/>
Everyone else in their group might be the type who could do anything on their first try.<br/>
This might be the reason why they couldn’t do anything regarding Kyouka’s situation.<br/>
In addition, she herself started losing confidence upon seeing what the other girls around her could do.<br/>
The reason why she couldn’t practice magic properly was because she was constantly under pressure.<br/>
In a way, she was kind of unlucky…<br/>
「Not at all, the one who helped me use magic is you, Kuroki-san!」<br/>
Kyouka took my hands and jumped in joy as she thanked me.<br/>
「Er, that is…」<br/>
To be honest, I don’t think I did something that great which deserved this much gratitude. But I guess I really couldn’t win against a beauty’s smile/<br/>
「I’m all fired up now! I mean, even the super-duper useless Kuroki-san can win against my dear brother, this is the result of him always striving to be better than before!」<br/>
When Kyouka said these words, I couldn’t tell whether it was praise or not due to the carefree smile on her face.<br/>
