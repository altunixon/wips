BBQ USAPIRU. <br/>

Reward <br/>
Firo is wearing my mantle as we head to the weapon shop. <br/>
 <br/>
Old Man: "Hey lad." <br/>
 <br/>
The old man waves as we approach. <br/>
 <br/>
Naofumi: "Did something happen?" <br/>
Old Man: "Yea. Wait a moment." <br/>
 <br/>
The old man closes the weapon shop and guides us. <br/>
We arrived at the magic shop where I received the magic book. <br/>
 <br/>
Magic Shop SK: "Oh my." <br/>
 <br/>
The aunt from the magic shop beams when she sees the old man. <br/>
 <br/>
Magic Shop SK: "Why don't you guys come in?" <br/>
Naofumi: "Right, Firo, don't change into your true form until I permit you to." <br/>
Firo: "Okay." <br/>
 <br/>
At the back of the magic shop, there was a workplace that smelled of nature. <br/>
We were guided to the workplace. <br/>
The ceiling was quite high, about 3m. <br/>
In the middle of the floor was a magic square with a crystal. <br/>
 <br/>
Magic Shop SK: "I'm sorry it's a little crowded because I’m working." <br/>
Naofumi: "No it's fine. Anyway, is there any clothing for children here?" <br/>
Old Man: "This aunty from the magic shop is an acquaintance that could help you." <br/>
Magic Shop SK: "That's right~" <br/>
 <br/>
She removed the crystal and puts an old design sewing machine on a pedestal. <br/>
Remember the bobbin machine? That one from Sleeping Beauty. <br/>
(Tl note: http://i.imgur.com/fsS6plV.png ) <br/>
 <br/>
Magic Shop SK: "Is that child really a demon?" <br/>
Naofumi: "Yeah, let me take off the mantle first before she changes. Firo, return to your original form." <br/>
 <br/>
There should be enough room in here for her original form. <br/>
 <br/>
Firo: "Ok" <br/>
 <br/>
When I gave the command, Firo removed the mantle and returned to her original form. <br/>
 <br/>
Magic Shop SK: "Oh my, Oh dear" <br/>
 <br/>
The magic shop aunty looked up at Firo who returns to her Philorial Queen form in surprise. <br/>
 <br/>
Firo: "Is this all right?" <br/>
 <br/>
The scene is very strange to do Firo's voice contrasting with her body. <br/>
Even though this is a fantasy world, it's still weird... <br/>
I looked towards Raphtalia <br/>
 <br/>
Raphtalia: "What is it?" <br/>
Naofumi: "Nothing" <br/>
 <br/>
That reminds me, Raphtalia is also a Demi-human. <br/>
Now that I think about it, in the past when I could feel something like romance, I might have been be very excited, it seems Motoyasu is the same, though that's in the past. <br/>
 <br/>
Magic Shop SK: "So what clothes do you need?" <br/>
Naofumi: "Can you make something that won't break when it transforms?" <br/>
Magic Shop SK: "Strictly speaking, I’m not sure I can make clothes." <br/>
Naofumi: "What!?" <br/>
Magic Shop SK: "Hero-sama, what do you see?" <br/>
Naofumi: "Magic shop... And a witch." <br/>
Magic Shop SK: "That's right. I only have some knowledge on transformation." <br/>
 <br/>
Though I don't really understand the common sense of this world... I know that witches can transform into animals. <br/>
 <br/>
Magic Shop SK: "Oh my, it takes a great amount of magical power and a very troublesome procedure to transform yourself into an animal. Wouldn't it be bothersome to put on clothes every time you transformed?" <br/>
 <br/>
Hm? So it seems it is possible for witches to transform. <br/>
The aunty answered while working on the bobbin. <br/>
By appearances alone it resembles a sewing machine from my world. <br/>
 <br/>
Magic Shop SK: "Staying in her true form at home is fine, but if she transforms in a crowded place, it would be pretty serious." <br/>
Naofumi: "Yeah, that's right." <br/>
 <br/>
Clothes are my main concern. Walking around naked would stand out. <br/>
 <br/>
Magic Shop SK: "Therefore, it would be best if the clothes could be stored safely when transformed and re-equipped when reverting" <br/>
Naofumi: "I see." <br/>
 <br/>
True, if the clothes just disappear after transforming, the problem would be solved. <br/>
 <br/>
Magic Shop SK: "It’s a technique passed down by demon category of Demi-humans. A famous one is a vampire's mantle." <br/>
 <br/>
Yeah, like when they transformed into bats or wolves. That is in this world too? <br/>
 <br/>
Magic Shop SK: "Well, this bobbin machine makes the materials for those clothes." <br/>
Naofumi: "Interesting... What do the clothes transform to?" <br/>
Magic Shop SK: "Strictly speaking, what are clothes? Something visible to others, correct?" <br/>
 <br/>
I tilted my neck and gave the aunty of the magic shop a puzzled look. <br/>
What does that mean? <br/>
 <br/>
Magic Shop SK: "What I mean is, this item can transform thread to magical power and magical power to threads. Therefore, the user can change a thread to magical power at any time." <br/>
Magic Shop SK: "To put it simply, the user can change the thread to magical power and vice-versa." <br/>
Naofumi: "Oh, I understand." <br/>
 <br/>
Now I understand why the old man from the weapon shop brought us here. <br/>
It'll certainly be weird to call these clothes. When not in human form the magical power circulates the body, and takes shape once back to human form. <br/>
 <br/>
Magic Shop SK: "This is Firo-chan right? Turn the wheel on this slowly." <br/>
Firo: "Ok" <br/>
 <br/>
Firo begins to slowly turn the wheel on the bobbin machine. <br/>
A thread comes out immediately and the aunty wraps it around a spool. <br/>
Then, thread starts to gather on the spool. <br/>
 <br/>
Naofumi?: "Hmm? It feels weaker." <br/>
Magic Shop SK: "This changes magical power to threads. It should be tiring, but I just need a little more to make clothes." <br/>
Naofumi: "Hmm... Interesting." <br/>
 <br/>
Firo is still a child who is barely one week old. <br/>
Firo looks tired while spinning the machine. <br/>
 <br/>
Naofumi: "Endure it, I'll promise you something." <br/>
Firo: "Food? Delicious food?" <br/>
Naofumi: "Yeah" <br/>
 <br/>
I am a man who keeps his promises. I’ll let you eat your fill of delicious food later, Firo. <br/>
 <br/>
Firo: "I'll do my best!" <br/>
 <br/>
Firo begins to energetically turn the bobbin machine. <br/>
 <br/>
Firo: "Yay, I'll do my best!" <br/>
 <br/>
The aunty seemed surprised at the speed. <br/>
 <br/>
Naofumi: "Old man, I owe you a meal. Are you free after this?" <br/>
Old Man: "I left a note at the shop explaining I’ll be closed till early afternoon. What're you going to treat me to, lad?" <br/>
Naofumi: "How about this, can you prepare a big iron plate? <br/>
Old Man: "What're you going to use that for?" <br/>
Naofumi: "I'm going to cook." <br/>
Old Man: "The lad's home cooking? I was expecting something different." <br/>
Naofumi: "What was that?" <br/>
 <br/>
I am slightly offended by the old man's disappointed expression. <br/>
 <br/>
Old Man: "Oh well, what did I expect." <br/>
Naofumi: "Raphtalia, go to the market to get meat, vegetables, and charcoal. Firo can eat enough for 5 people." <br/>
Raphtalia: "Understood" <br/>
 <br/>
I handed some silver coins to Raphtalia to go shopping. <br/>
 <br/>
Firo: "Food~ Food~" <br/>
 <br/>
Firo is in high spirits while spinning the bobbin machine. <br/>
 <br/>
Magic Shop SK: "That's enough. You can stop spinning now." <br/>
 <br/>
After awhile aunty told her to stop. <br/>
 <br/>
Firo: "Will there be more food if I turn it more?" <br/>
Naofumi: "No. you can stop." <br/>
Firo: "Yay~" <br/>
 <br/>
Firo returned to her original form. <br/>
 <br/>
Firo: "Master~ food~" <br/>
Naofumi:"Hold on a bit." <br/>
Firo: "Eh-..." <br/>
 <br/>
Firo sounded very disappointed. Raphtalia hasn't returned yet, so there is no food. <br/>
 <br/>
Naofumi: "When we leave the shop, return to your humanoid form." <br/>
Firo: "Ok" <br/>
 <br/>
Do you really understand? <br/>
 <br/>
Magic Shop SK: "You can use this to make your clothes." <br/>
 <br/>
The magic shop aunty shows us the thread. <br/>
Old Man?: "I'll go ask someone who knows how to weave this." <br/>
Naofumi: "I have high hopes for that fellow. Firo, let's go." <br/>
Magic Shop SK?: "What should I tell the young lady who went shopping?" <br/>
Naofumi: "Tell her we'll be waiting at the gate that leaves castle town." <br/>
Magic Shop SK?: "Understood." <br/>
 <br/>
Following the old man from the weapon shop, we left the magic shop. <br/>
 <br/>
Magic Shop SK: "As for the fee, I’ll be sending it to the weapon shop~" <br/>
Naofumi: "How much would that be…?" <br/>
 <br/>
I asked a little anxiously. <br/>
 <br/>
Magic Shop SK: "Making the magic string? Because the crystal is expensive, I’ll charge Hero-sama 50 silver." <br/>
 <br/>
Damn! Firo is expensive. <br/>
In the future, we need to be careful with clothes, it's like wearing money. <br/>
We head to the weaver with the thread. <br/>
 <br/>
Weaver: "This is some unusual material, I could do a lot with this. Go to the dressing room and measure your size. I should be able to complete the dress tonight. You can pick it up later." <br/>
 <br/>
We went straight to the dressing room. <br/>
Although there is only a mantle, it still took a while. <br/>
 <br/>
Sales Clerk: "Wow...... that's a very cute child." <br/>
 <br/>
The sales clerk is a girl with glasses and a scarf. <br/>
She seems a little plain. By that, I mean she looks like the kind of girl from my world who would write doujinshis. <br/>
 <br/>
Sales Clerk: "Her wings are just like an angel. She seems similar to a Demi-human... I'll work on your order now." <br/>
Naofumi: "Is that so?" <br/>
 <br/>
The old man puts a hand on my shoulder. <br/>
 <br/>
Old Man: "There are Demi-humans who have hands or feet that resemble birds. But this child only seems to have wings, so it's pretty great." <br/>
Firo: "Hm~?" <br/>
 <br/>
Firo tilted her neck while looking up at the sales clerk. <br/>
 <br/>
Naofumi: "Yeah... This fellow is a demon that can transform into a humanoid. When she reverts to her true form, her clothes break." <br/>
Sales Clerk: "Interesting...... So that's why you need clothes made from magical power." <br/>
 <br/>
Her glasses gave off a dangerous light. <br/>
As I thought, this girl reminds me of an Otaku. <br/>
I feel a little nostalgic because I had an acquaintance selling doujinshis within a circle. <br/>
She would often give me admission tickets for the circle and was quite friendly. <br/>
Sigh... There's no such thing in a different world. <br/>
 <br/>
Sales Clerk: "This material is perfect for a one piece dress, It will be unaffected as well since it'll just turn to magic." <br/>
Naofumi: "Eh? Uh sure?" <br/>
 <br/>
Firo is measured again after she puts on her mantle and then the clerk starts designing something. <br/>
 <br/>
Sales Clerk: “I want to see her true form!" <br/>
 <br/>
Firo looked at me with a troubled face. I gulp and looked around. <br/>
 <br/>
Naofumi: "It seems to just barely fit here." <br/>
 <br/>
Firo's changed form will just barely fit under the ceiling less than 2m. <br/>
 <br/>
Sales Clerk?: "Can you sit down?" <br/>
Sales Clerk?: "Yea, that's good." <br/>
 <br/>
Firo changed back to her demon form while paying attention to the ceiling, and stared at the girl. <br/>
 <br/>
Sales Clerk: "Oh-... This gap is good!" <br/>
 <br/>
Not even being shaken by Firo's true form... This dressmaker can do it! <br/>
As expected of a character who sells doujins. I'm glad this is a different world. <br/>
 <br/>
Sales Clerk: "I'll bet a ribbon will suit her." <br/>
 <br/>
Firo's neck size is measured by the dressmaker and she begins to design clothes again. <br/>
 <br/>
Sales Clerk: "Well I’m going to wait for materials to arrive!" <br/>
 <br/>
She seems excited while answering. <br/>
 <br/>
Old Man?:"This fellow is a good craftsman." <br/>
Naofumi: "I guess…" <br/>
 <br/>
She is the type to be absorbed in her work and will accomplish it by all means. <br/>
 <br/>
Old Man?: "Well, it will be completed tomorrow." <br/>
Naofumi: "That's fast. How much is this going to cost in total?" <br/>
Old Man?: "I recommended you to this place so it should be around 100 silver pieces." <br/>
 <br/>
Ugh... I received a shock. <br/>
 <br/>
Naofumi: "Firo, do you understand? I spent a large sum of 400 pieces of silver on you. I expect you to work diligently." <br/>
Firo: "Okay!" <br/>
 <br/>
Do you really understand? We left the shop with Firo in her human form. <br/>
We joined up with Raphtalia, who was waiting at the gate of the castle town. <br/>
 <br/>
Raphtalia: "Naofumi-sama, I bought the ingredients you asked for.” <br/>
Naofumi: "Firo costs 400 pieces of silver. Raphtalia was cheaper." <br/>
Raphtalia: "Please don't say it like I'm a cheap woman!" <br/>
 <br/>
Sigh... Is this going to be okay? <br/>
 <br/>
Naofumi: "Alright, old man, bring the iron plate. Firo, get a cart and carry it from the weapon shop." <br/>
Firo: "Ok!" <br/>
Old Man: "Alright…" <br/>
 <br/>
Firo left with the old man for the weapon shop and came back pulling a cart. <br/>
Why is she pulling it in her human form? <br/>
An iron plate within the size I was imagining was within the cart. <br/>
 <br/>
Naofumi: "Alright, let's leave the castle town and go to the riverbank near the grassy plains." <br/>
 <br/>
We arrived at the riverbank. <br/>
I took out the iron plate, put it on a griddle and immediately put charcoal under it. <br/>
 <br/>
Naofumi: "Raphtalia and Old man, take care of the fire." <br/>
Old Man: "Yeah yeah.” <br/>
Raphtalia: "Okay" <br/>
 <br/>
As expected of the old man of a weapon shop, it seems managing fire is his forte. <br/>
 <br/>
Firo: "What about Firo?" <br/>
Naofumi: "Stand watch so that balloons don't approach us..." <br/>
Firo: "Okay~!" <br/>
 <br/>
I told Firo to do something else because she would likely fail doing anything here. <br/>
I cut the meat and vegetables that Raphtalia brought into appropriate sizes and put it near the grill. <br/>
 <br/>
Old Man: "Lad, the charcoal is ready" <br/>
Naofumi: "Yeah" <br/>
 <br/>
Raphtalia and the old man heated the plate as per my instructions, so I put the fatty meat onto the grill for the oil. <br/>
Then I spread out the vegetables and meat so they aren't directly on top of the fire. <br/>
 <br/>
Old Man: "You sure are skilful" <br/>
 <br/>
I used a stick and a knife to turn the meat and vegetables so they don't burn. <br/>
 <br/>
Naofumi: "Well, this should be fine." <br/>
 <br/>
Yup. Today's lunch is a barbecue by the riverbank. Firo's reward. <br/>
 <br/>
Naofumi: "Firo, it’s ready." <br/>
Firo: "Okay~" <br/>
 <br/>
Firo was already drooling from the smell when she took the skewer I handed her. <br/>
 <br/>
Firo: "Yaay~! This is delicious!" <br/>
 <br/>
Firo starts throwing meat and vegetables that were just cooked into her mouth. <br/>
 <br/>
Naofumi: "Hey don't eat everything, this is for everyone." <br/>
Firo: "Mfkay~" <br/>
 <br/>
Firo nodded while stuffing her mouth. <br/>
Do you really understand? <br/>
 <br/>
Naofumi: "Let’s eat I guess…" <br/>
Raphtalia: "Okay" <br/>
Old Man: "Sure" <br/>
 <br/>
I distributed the meat and vegetables onto some leaves and hand it Raphtalia and the old man. <br/>
 <br/>
Old Man: "Oh this is delicious. I'm surprised grilled meat tastes so good." <br/>
Raphtalia: "For some reason, this dish that Naofumi-sama makes is strangely delicious." <br/>
Naofumi: "I'll take that as a compliment" <br/>
Old Man: "I'm not flattering you. Why does it taste so good?" <br/>
 <br/>
The old man looked at his plate with a puzzled expression. <br/>
 <br/>
Naofumi: "It's probably the result of the cooking skill from my shield." <br/>
Old Man: "The power of the shield?" <br/>
Naofumi: "Well, at least I think so." <br/>
 <br/>
From the corner of my sight I see, Barbeque is now available. Quality: Good -> Great quality. <br/>
To think that such a strange icon would exist. <br/>
 <br/>
Old Man: "That's such a mysterious shield. I'm quite envious." <br/>
Naofumi: "I can't take it off so it's quite inconvenient." <br/>
 <br/>
Not to mention the non-existent offensive power. <br/>
Oh right, there was the special effect from the Bee Needle Shield that I can counter attack enemies with called [Shield of the Needle].  <br/>
Although the enemy would have escaped before I beat it, unless it's slow like a balloon. <br/>
As expected, even if the demon runs away, I’m at a disadvantage. <br/>
Sometimes, a smart monster would ignore me and aim for Raphtalia. <br/>
 <br/>
Old Man: "Haven't you become quite strong?" <br/>
Naofumi: "I don't know... Compared to the other heroes…" <br/>
Old Man: "Is that so, are the legendary weapons that powerful?" <br/>
Naofumi: "That’s right, I learned from experience.” <br/>
Old Man: "I see" <br/>
Naofumi: "Then-" <br/>
 <br/>
Because skills could be acquired in various ways, the power of a legendary weapon is way above average. <br/>
Moreover, accumulating status improvements whenever a shield is unsealed is good. <br/>
There are a bunch of conditions that unseal new shields, such as absorbing monsters and other materials, levelling up and the skill tree. <br/>
Besides, any exclusive effects any shield that was released gives permanent bonuses. <br/>
Even a weak shield could be helpful if I unseal it. <br/>
Due to the Equipment bonuses carrying over, the more shields I unseal, the stronger the skills I use. <br/>
I can see how many bonus stats I got. My stats in general are higher than Raphtalia's. Maybe it's because I’m a hero. <br/>
 <br/>
Especially in the aspect of defence. I have 3 times more and that's not including the permanent bonuses from unsealing other shields. <br/>
Because I originally never attack, all the gear went to Raphtalia. After all, the potential ability as a Hero of the shield is in defence. The price for that is 1/10th of ATK. <br/>
 <br/>
The difference between a resident of this world and a hero would be from any effects granted by this shield. <br/>
Otherwise, I can never beat a monster with just defence. <br/>
After all, the only reason a hero is different from a normal person was because of the legendary weapon. It could be considered that you are only a hero because you have the legendary weapon. <br/>
I hate it, but I am only a hero because of this shield. <br/>
It seems there is an influence from being the companion of a hero. <br/>
Raphtalia is superior to normal Demi-humans because of the ability from Slave trainer Shield and Firo's abilities are on par with her despite the level difference. <br/>
I don't know how much effect Growth Correction had, but it seems to be quite large. <br/>
The effects of Slave Trainer Shield and Demon Trainer Shield are good. I wonder what effects Friend Shield would have, if that even exists. <br/>
It seems the existences called companions are essential for a hero. <br/>
 <br/>
Friend huh...... an existence I don't have. <br/>
 <br/>
Old Man: "I see... It seems heroes really are different from us commoners." <br/>
Naofumi: "That seems to be the case." <br/>
 <br/>
Travelling around the world, absorbing various demons and materials to grow stronger. <br/>
Honestly, there’s just so much more to examine. <br/>
I don't understand how much I can improve the shield. <br/>
But if I don't do anything, the wave of disaster will strike. <br/>
I don't know how many times it will come either. <br/>
It’s been twice already. Maybe 5 times, 10 times, or even 100 times, I don't know. <br/>
Whatever it is, I can't just sit around and do nothing. <br/>
That reminds me...There seems to be a worrisome shield called Curse Series. <br/>
At that time when I almost lost Raphtalia, the Curse series was released and started eroding the shield. <br/>
I've looked for that skill tree many times. <br/>
However, I can't find it no matter how hard I look. <br/>
I’ll try asking for help. <br/>
 <br/>
Curse Series <br/>
I hesitated to ask. <br/>
 <br/>
I only type in that sentence. Besides, I checked many times. I feel a shock and the letters change. <br/>
 <br/>
Curse Series <br/>
Armour that grants power and consumes the user. Hero! Do not use it. <br/>
 <br/>
Therefore, I decided to stay away from this topic. <br/>
When I need it, the power will appear. This shield seems to have many limitations. <br/>
 <br/>
Firo: "Master~ there's no more meat" <br/>
Naofumi: "What!" <br/>
 <br/>
When I look there is no more meat. Everyone has already finished eating the stuff I prepared. <br/>
All that's left are vegetables. <br/>
 <br/>
Firo: "Is it already over? Firo still wants to eat more." <br/>
Naofumi: "Uhmm, well... Go to the forest and catch 5 Usapiru. I’ll cook those too." <br/>
Firo: "Okay~!" <br/>
 <br/>
Firo rushed to the forest at full speed. <br/>
 <br/>
Old Man: "Oh man, that was delicious. Totally worth it." <br/>
Naofumi: "If you think that, then discount the price of clothes." <br/>
Old Man: "Lad, there's already a heavy discount, it'll be a large loss if I discount any more." <br/>
 <br/>
Oh well, we barbecued next to the riverbank till evening and then called it a day. <br/>
By the way, Firo caught 10 Usapiru. <br/>
I barely had time to eat. Mostly managing the barbecue and dismantling Usapiru to roast.
<br/>
