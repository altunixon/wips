Someone asked for a poll, so here.<br/>
Take Our Poll<br/>
Chapter 208: Shortcut<br/>
"Fube-" (Firo)<br/>
With Firo’s acrobatic kick, the carriage was shot to the other side of the ravine.<br/>
The people inside, us, are all slammed against the sides of it. We’ve all developed some mental traumas now.<br/>
"To-!" (Firo)<br/>
Running up the collapsing bridge, Firo is able to catch up to the carriage at an amazing speed.<br/>
I knew that crossing the bridge would be an extreme shortcut, but it was outside the bounds of human ability.<br/>
… Well, Firo is a monster.<br/>
"Uu… I don’t think I had enough lives to spare for that." (Melty)<br/>
"What a coincidence. I think the same." (Naofumi)<br/>
"If you think that, then choose the route more carefully!" (Melty)<br/>
"We have to use this route if we want to win." (Naofumi)<br/>
I leave it at that.<br/>
Honestly, I don’t care whether we win or lose.<br/>
But this was a great shortcut. We’ve pretty much caught up with Motoyasu’s group.<br/>
I pull out the map and check it again.<br/>
Let’s see, Motoyasu is… If I rely on the light of the torch, he’s quite ahead.<br/>
"Next comes five devilish hairpin turns. Be careful." (Naofumi)<br/>
One wrong step will send us hurtling down the cliffs. Truly a devilish series of turns.<br/>
… When did my mind shift into Race Game mode?<br/>
"Yeah!" (Firo)<br/>
Firo takes the turns perfectly.<br/>
Yeah, this would be impossible with a car.<br/>
The carriage shakes up and down, and sways from side to side.<br/>
"Uge… Aga…" (Melty)<br/>
"Fue… Muwa…" (Rishia)<br/>
"This is quite amazing." (Atlas)<br/>
Why is Atlas perfectly fine when we’re shaking this much?<br/>
I’m relatively fine, though.<br/>
Is it because of Magic Flow or Chi?<br/>
No, Rishia is no good, so that’s probably not it.<br/>
"Uu… I’m going to die. At this rate, we’re all going to die." (Melty)<br/>
For once, Melty acts like a child.<br/>
You’re the one who wants to win. Deal with it.<br/>
Be thankful you were born in a world where this much isn’t enough to kill you.<br/>
"Fueee…" (Rishia)<br/>
"If you hate it so much, then let Firo become Motoyasu’s." (Naofumi)<br/>
"No…" (Melty)<br/>
"To prioritize friendship over your life, you’ll become a fine Queen." (Naofumi)<br/>
"That doesn’t make me happy. If you tell me that now, that doesn’t make me happy at all…" (Melty)<br/>
I’m surrounded by corpses. Perhaps I should have taken Taniko and Gaelion.<br/>
They could evacuate the people here…<br/>
"Now that I think about it, can’t you just get off?" (Naofumi)<br/>
"How am I supposed to do that!?" (Melty)<br/>
"Use magic?" (Naofumi)<br/>
"There’s no way I can chant Magic in this situation!" (Melty)<br/>
"It’s not like anything’s preventing you. Right. Can’t you use water Magic, and use the recoil to fly?"<br/>
"Quit joking around!" (Melty)<br/>
The other option is to send them off with Portal Shield.<br/>
But if I do that, I won’t be able to get back.<br/>
"Can’t you even act a little motivated?" (Melty)<br/>
"Not with Motoyasu as my opponent." (Naofumi)<br/>
"I can understand your feelings, but don’t you care what happens to Firo?" (Melty)<br/>
Ehehe. Master~.<br/>
… I guess Firo has been helping me quite a bit.<br/>
And I can’t deny that looking at her soothes me.<br/>
But I can’t forget how she looked at me as if I were her prey this morning.<br/>
Her head is only filled with thoughts of violating me. And food.<br/>
As I think that, my head seems to cool down.<br/>
"What? Even if Firo becomes Motoyasu’s belongings, we’ll still interact with her the same way." (Naofumi)<br/>
"After thinking, that’s your conclusion!? Do you really hate doing it with Firo-chan that much?" (Melty)<br/>
"Isn’t it obvious? I care for Firo, but I don’t have the time to be doing things like that." (Naofumi)<br/>
"Ah… I never thought the day would come when I wished the creepy Naofumi were here." (Melty)<br/>
"Fuee, My head is spinning. I think I’m going crazy…" (Rishia)<br/>
"To say such a  thing here. Rishia, you’re quite a pervert." (Atlas)<br/>
"Why are you only speaking up to that!?" (Melty)<br/>
Even though I say that, we’ve almost caught up.<br/>
But we’re also closing in on the goal.<br/>
At this rate, we’ll lose.<br/>
Ah, the light is shining on Motoyasu from the torch on the cliff.<br/>
There’s quite a turn before we can reach his location. If we were able to jump to the other side of the curve, we would be able to win, but I don’t think that’s possible.<br/>
"Firo, you can see a light on that cliff, right? That’s the goal. At this rate we will lose." (Naofumi)<br/>
"No!" (Firo)<br/>
Firo veers off the road!<br/>
"Cliff! Firo, that’s a cliff! We can’t fly, you know! We’ll Faaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa-!" (Melty)<br/>
"Fueeeeeeeeeeeee!" (Rishia)<br/>
It’s over. Everything is over.<br/>
Was I satisfied with my short life?<br/>
It would be nice if we could survive.<br/>
Hm?<br/>
There’s still something we can do… but there probably isn’t enough time.<br/>
"To-!" (Firo)<br/>
Firo grabs onto the top of the carriage, and starts flapping her wings. The wind begins to pick up.<br/>
The wind whistles loudly.<br/>
Could it be that Firo is going to fly?<br/>
I recall how she was trying to beat Gaelion. Did she practice to be an aerial mount?<br/>
I forgot the obvious fact that Firo is a bird.<br/>
If she pushes herself, she should be able to fly.<br/>
Oh? We seem to be gliding for a bit.<br/>
"Wauuuuuuu…" (Firo)<br/>
What sort of island is this? (TL: this is a reference, but I don’t know to what.)<br/>
Though she may fit, being a gluttonous character.<br/>
Does she plan to take a shortcut like this?<br/>
But I’m not sure if this will go well. There’s a high chance of failure. We’re slowly losing altitude.<br/>
Firo’s body is not one modelled for extended flight.<br/>
Is it her weight? I’m surprised Gaelion can even fly with his massive body.<br/>
Could it be because physics work differently in this world? Then what of the usually flightless Filo Rial?<br/>
… I should probably lend a hand.<br/>
「E Float Shield! 」「Second Shield!」<br/>
I deploy these shields at the very end of my range.<br/>
And…<br/>
「Change Shield!」<br/>
I choose the rope shield. It can be used as a grappling hook.<br/>
This was an ability that unlocked when I awakened it.<br/>
Using it, I can send a rope out of the Shield and pull things closer.<br/>
The Chimera Viper Shield has a similar effect, but its range is smaller.<br/>
Pretty much, I will be able to attach the carriage to the floating anchors.<br/>
After we swing on the first shield like a pendulum, I send the hook towards the next one.<br/>
「Shield Prison!」<br/>
My shield prison manifests below the carriage.<br/>
"Firo!" (Naofumi)<br/>
"Yeah!" (Firo)<br/>
When we get close enough, I release the Shields, and Firo Kicks the carriage with all her might. We arrive at the other side of the cliff. And Firo uses the Shield Prison as a platform to reach us.<br/>
We once again start heading for the goal.<br/>
"I definitely didn’t have enough lives for that one…" (Melty)<br/>
Melty is collapsed on the floor of the carriage in exhaoustion.<br/>
I feel the same.<br/>
I’m never racing with Firo again.<br/>
Next time a race comes up, I’m abandoning her with Portal Shield.<br/>
But I don’t think a race will come up again in the foreseeable future.<br/>
"I’m dying. I’ll definitely die." (Melty)<br/>
"I withstood the Spirit Turtle’s attacks. I’m here with you." (Naofumi)<br/>
"Is that supposed to make me feel better?" (Melty)<br/>
What’s bugging her so much?<br/>
Worse comes to worst, I’d at least use a technique to cushion our fall.<br/>
Though we’d be left in pitch black at the bottom of the cliff.<br/>
Anyways, we’ve taken a massive shortcut. Motoyasu should be behind us.<br/>
We pass by the torch that marked the goal, and stopped.<br/>
"Victory." (Naofumi)<br/>
Since we fell behind in the start, we had to desperately grasp for victory. As expected of Firo.<br/>
The fact that Motoyasu’s three Filo Rials were able to take on Human form, means they’re probably Queens as well, though.<br/>
But they don’t have Ahoges.<br/>
"Uu…" (Melty)<br/>
"Fue…" (Rishia)<br/>
"I won!" (Firo)<br/>
While surprised with her victory, Firo climbs onto the roof of the carriage and begins singing.<br/>
What sort of ritual is this?<br/>
She’s really excited. Has she forgotten the resentment she had against me?<br/>
But our carriage is now on the verge of collapse.<br/>
The wheels can barely be called as such, and the frame is severely warped.<br/>
I’ll have to buy a new one.<br/>
Wasted money…<br/>
Should I request it from Motoyasu?<br/>
No… I don’t really want his beat up carriage either…<br/>
"It’s Firo’s win! Firo is number one. Firo is the fastest. She won’t lose to the likes of Gaelion!" (Firo)<br/>
She’s getting loud.<br/>
I have a feeling she’s looking at me like I’m prey again.<br/>
"The only one Master will ride is Firo! The only one Master will ride is Fi-… ouou." (Firo)<br/>
I tolerated the first half, but I couldn’t forgive the second one. She was swaying her hips.<br/>
Until Motoyasu arrived, Firo kept singing of her victory.<br/>
Does she really hate Gaelion that much?<br/>
And soon after, Motoyasu and his noisy three come storming in.<br/>
"I-I lost…" (Motoyasu)<br/>
Motoyasu confirms that we arrived first, as he falls to his knees and places his hands on the ground.<br/>
—Author Note—<br/>
By the way, one of Motoyasu’s Filo Rials is male.<br/>
