Hatoken experienced some Technical Difficulties.<br/>
Chapter 151: Camping Plant<br/>
"It’s going quite well." (Naofumi)<br/>
"Right. For me to make this much progress in just 2 days, could I possibly be a genius?" (Rat)<br/>
"Naofumi-sama…" (Rafatalia)<br/>
It’s been two days since then. Rafatalia is facing me with a serious face.<br/>
I think I overdid it as well.<br/>
I had tried to modify the Bioplant with Rat’s help. Because of this, quite a few people are watching our work.<br/>
Having a specialist really helps.<br/>
Rat has already been registered as one of my slaves. I have set the crest to punish her if she tries to lie to me.<br/>
The punishment has been set to the highest level. Based on the severity of her actions, she may die.<br/>
I can’t be negligent. Though for now, she seems to be satisfied while being immersed in research.<br/>
The real work starts from here on out.<br/>
First, I modified a Bioplant seed to be more like the original monstrous variety in order to grant it sentience, and registered it as a monster under my control. I handed it over to Rat for research purposes.<br/>
Rat takes out some complex machinery and begins to perform further modifications on the plant.<br/>
There was the danger that it may have been able to break the seal, as Firo did, but this time it was a success.<br/>
As we plant the seed, the Bioplant begins to come to life and move as commanded.<br/>
The Bioplant we tried to make today was one that would be able to act as a house.<br/>
We’ll be getting more slaves soon, so it would be useful if we could speed up the building process.<br/>
Which is why we began working on this interesting project.<br/>
The experiment was a success. As long as we issued the order, the Bioplant would take the shape of a house.<br/>
The new creation was dubbed, ‘Camping Plant’.<br/>
Rat went off and arbitrarily named it on her own. I don’t really care so I’ll leave the name as is.<br/>
Flowers bloom to form an effective roof, and as long as we give a specific layout, the plant can take on the form of any building.<br/>
The flowers absorb light during the day, and can emit magic light at night if needed.<br/>
The slaves had high adaptability, so they readily moved into the dangerous-looking house.<br/>
I planned to use them for temporary lodging, but Kiel enthusiastically claimed the house as her own, so I guess it is what it is.<br/>
Are you sure you want the house of your dreams to be one built so easily?<br/>
A strength of these houses is that they can be easily cleared with herbicide and rebuilt if they got in the way.<br/>
This makes them exceedingly easy to manage.<br/>
And… Rafatalia is currently questioning me on the influx of green houses in the village.<br/>
"I’m sorry." (Naofumi)<br/>
"About what?" (Rafatalia)<br/>
"The village you lived in now looks like the dwelling of an evil sorcerer." (Naofumi)<br/>
"Well… there’s nothing we can do about that… I understand. I just thought that you were trusting Rat too easily." (Rafatalia)<br/>
"I think she’s the one trusting me way too easily." (Naofumi)<br/>
She had been staring at me intently while I modified the plant.<br/>
I thought that our methods of modification were the same, but it seems that she has taken a great interest in my general modification method. I think she called it ground-breaking or something.<br/>
(TL: as in how he can change entire attributes without taking the steps leading up to that into account)<br/>
Even if you say it’s ground-breaking, it’s the Shield’s capabilities so I can’t really help her on that.<br/>
It seems I can only make general modifications, so I have to leave the finer details to Rat.<br/>
The next thing to work on is a plant to produce medicine.<br/>
It seems that this will be quite difficult.<br/>
Up ‘til now I have made no progress in this field.<br/>
By the way, the prototype house we made was carnivorous.<br/>
I continually cautioned Rat not to enter it, but Firo and Taniko suddenly rushed in only to get eaten. Rafatalia and the rest had to cut it open and rescue them.<br/>
The villagers have been eyeing me with strange looks since then.<br/>
I also had Rat check the identity of the Monster eggs we had collected.<br/>
Additionally she checked the growth of the monsters I had under my watch. I explained my Monster User Shield’s ‘Growth Correction’ ability, and she began examining the Legendary Shield with zeal.<br/>
It seems that the Monster User seal had awakened, but I didn’t get any extra growth enhancements from it.<br/>
I was hoping for something that would raise my monster’s intelligence.<br/>
"I had heard that the Hero of the Shield’s monsters had abnormal strength. So this was the cause?" (Rat)<br/>
"Probably. And I’m quite sure the other heroes should be able to unlock these abilities as well." (Naofumi)<br/>
It’s not like I had this function from the beginning. The others should be able to unlock a Slave Series and Monster Use Series as well.<br/>
It’s even more likely that they will be able to get weapons that allow modification of plants like the Bioplant.<br/>
However plants like this are hard to come across.<br/>
I’ve only ever seen them in the Bioplant’s origin town, and this one.<br/>
"I won’t claim to be an expert, but I’ve never heard of such abilities coming from the other heroes." (Rat)<br/>
"I see." (Naofumi)<br/>
To put it bluntly, we don’t get along.<br/>
However from what I’ve heard, the Seven Star Heroes are supposed to be good people.<br/>
It seems that modifying monsters goes against the Church. Such straight-laced heroes probably wouldn’t delve into such subjects.<br/>
I don’t really want to trouble Rat further, and I honestly don’t care so I won’t ask what sort of people they are.<br/>
… If you look at this village objectively, how many laws are we breaking?<br/>
Now then, our food supply has become quite steady. The taste is also guaranteed, and it seems that Rat will be able to produce some variation in the fruits.<br/>
I’m leaving the training of the monsters to the slaves, and my peddling enterprise will soon be able to start in earnest.<br/>
The slaves have all passed level 30, so our fighting prowess isn’t a problem either.<br/>
In just a few days, we’ve made quite some progress.<br/>
"I was able to create a research lab so easily. This seed really is miraculous." (Rat)<br/>
Rat’s lab… it is a large building made of Camping Plant.<br/>
She had brought lab equipment with her from the start, so it seems that the lab is now usable.<br/>
From the building, I can hear the screams of a monster. It’s reminding me of a few Science Fiction stories.<br/>
At that moment, I had a few doubts about letting her set up shop here.<br/>
By the way, Taniko and Rat have become rivals in their treatment of monsters.<br/>
Taniko believed that monsters should get strong through battle and experience, while Rat opted for strengthening them through modification. Their opinions often clashed.<br/>
Due to their differing ideals, they often argued. It appears that they hate each other.<br/>
However, Taniko’s education is severely lacking so most of the time it seems that Rat is just toying with her.<br/>
"Then I shall work on the Bioplants until I get bored. After that, do you agree to assist me in my goals?" (Rat)<br/>
"Yeah, I also hold an interest in Monster Modification." (Naofumi)<br/>
If we have monsters that can stand on equal footing with those brought by the wave, then fighting will get a lot easier.<br/>
I need to scrape a fighting force together no matter what, so modification may prove to be a useful asset.<br/>
I learned from that incident with the Spirit Turtle that having more comrades is always useful.<br/>
If they’re strong then even more so.<br/>
It seems there was a Balloon egg mixed in with the rest.<br/>
No… It wasn’t an egg. It seems that a hibernating Balloon had been mistaken as an egg and carried off.<br/>
According to Rat, Balloons usually fly. They break off from a larger being called Balloon Legios, and can henceforth freely float in the sky.<br/>
If you see a strangely colored object in the sky, it is probably a Balloon Legios.<br/>
Though Balloon Legion rarely come to the ground, the numerous Balloons born from come down quite often.<br/>
They become completely independent after separating from the Legios.<br/>
After the Balloon awakened, I quickly had a monster seal placed on it, and it is now my subordinate.<br/>
As the Balloon levelled up, it got bigger as if it were being inflated. I tied it to the carriage and attached a banner onto it.<br/>
With this, it is connected to the carriage and will receive a portion of the EXP gained by Firo, who is pulling it.<br/>
The banner on it read ‘Hero of the Shield’s Peddling’<br/>
Its monster name appears to be Ad Balloon.<br/>
What sort of bad joke is this?<br/>
It seems that Ad Balloon had previously been cared for by a human.<br/>
I’m a bit afraid of a large floating balloon-shaped monster, but… (TL: Balloon is usually in English, in this line it is said in Japanese.)<br/>
Taniko readily mounted the Balloon and rode it into the sky with both arms outstretched. Seriously, what Valley did she crawl out of?<br/>
It’s really slow, but I guess I can assign it to guard duty.<br/>
I hold Balloons in high esteem.<br/>
I haven’t forgot my debt to them from when I first fought Motoyasu.<br/>
"You are hereby deemed Test Subject #1." (Rat)<br/>
"Garu!" (Ad Balloon)<br/>
"Quiet." (Naofumi)<br/>
Perhaps due to the Shield’s influence, this monster seems to possess a higher level of intelligence than other Balloons<br/>
"… Now then, I will be leaving for peddling." (Naofumi)<br/>
"Understood." (Rafatalia)<br/>
"Then I will be continuing with my research. If you need me, you can find me in my lab, Count." (Rat)<br/>
Count… That’s right, I got a title.<br/>
I had completely forgotten.<br/>
"Hmm? I had heard that you were a Count. Am I wrong?" (Rat)<br/>
"No, you’re correct." (Naofumi)<br/>
"Anyways, if you have any business, please stop over." (Rat)<br/>
"Yes, Yes. Oh, and remember that just because I’m not here doesn’t mean you can cause trouble." (Naofumi)<br/>
"I know. I won’t do something that foolish." (Rat)<br/>
"I wonder." (Naofumi)<br/>
I think about how to produce a medicine generating Bioplant as I call Firo over. I get on the Carriage and set out for the neighboring village.<br/>
