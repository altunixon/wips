Stalling for Time <br/>
 <br/>
 <br/>
“Illumination magic should be fired after the troops finish mounting the Spirit Turtle. Please hop on then, Iwatani-sama” (queen) <br/>
“Understood. Then, operation start!” (random soldier) <br/>
“Roger that. Everyone! We're going!” (shield) <br/>
“Okay” (raphtalia) <br/>
“Oka~y” (filo) <br/>
“I'll do my best!” (rishia) <br/>
 <br/>
Ans thus Filo and I faced the Spirit Turtle for another assault. <br/>
During that time, Raphtalia, Rishia and half of the Allied forces circled around the Spirit Turtle's back to mount it. <br/>
 <br/>
“Together with Master~” (filo) <br/>
 <br/>
Filo let me ride on her in good humour, and ran towards the Spirit Turtle. <br/>
Such a fearless kid. <br/>
I checked the number of Mana Potions and.... medicine.... and stood before the Spirit Turtle. <br/>
 <br/>
“――――――――――!” (turtle) <br/>
 <br/>
As the Spirit Turtle detected us, it simultaneously released a swarm of familiars. <br/>
And then it used its body to trample down on us. <br/>
 <br/>
“Zweite Aura! Meteor Shield!” (shield) <br/>
 <br/>
I chanted protective magic while raising my voice, and deployed Meteor Shield. <br/>
The Spirit Turtle's foot rained down on us and caused an earthquake. <br/>
As if I'm going to take that obediently! <br/>
Just like that, we evasively dodged its foot before Meteor Shield could be broken. <br/>
Fissures formed in the ground. <br/>
In the midst of a dust cloud being raised, I used my whole body to grasp the Spirit Turtle's foot before it could lift its gigantic leg. <br/>
 <br/>
“―――――――――――!?” (turtle) <br/>
 <br/>
It seemed that the Spirit Turtle raised its voice in surprise at being unable to raise its leg at will. <br/>
Such a sorry state. <br/>
gu....gu gu...... *clench* <br/>
Nevertheless, if I show even a little hint of an opening then the Spirit Turtle will try to raise its leg. And in terms of strength, I don't have nearly enough to prevent from being thrown out into the air.  <br/>
The good thing is that the neck didn't extend up to the tip of the forefoot that we were on. I'll try to make use of that. <br/>
 <br/>
“―――――――――――!” (turtle) <br/>
 <br/>
Familiars were released in our direction. <br/>
Now! <br/>
A large number of magic circles were deployed in the sky, and fire came raining down incessantly.  <br/>
A wave of supporting magic swept down from the rear and descended upon the familiars, stitching up that interval. <br/>
 <br/>
“Tahh!” (filo) <br/>
 <br/>
Filo kicked the familiars away, protecting me. <br/>
 <br/>
“How long do we hafta wait?” (filo) <br/>
“Who knows” (shield) <br/>
 <br/>
gu gu....... *clench* <br/>
This is bad, if I lose even a bit of focus I won't be able to restrain the Spirit Turtle's foot. <br/>
All the same, it's only focusing in my direction so the rear was defenceless. <br/>
 <br/>
“Master......that” (filo) <br/>
 <br/>
I looked behind the Spirit Turtle, through the gap in its legs. Well, what I could see was no larger than a speck. <br/>
A ladder or rope hung in order for the army and Raphtalia's party, who had circled to the rear, to climb onto the depths of the Spirit Turtle's shell. <br/>
It appeared that there were also wyvern-riding soldiers who boarded the Spirit Turtle favourably and were lending a hand. <br/>
All right...... <br/>
A crackling vibration transmitted through the Spirit Turtle. <br/>
This is....... <br/>
The Spirit Turtle turned to use and tried to fire its special move. <br/>
 <br/>
“Filo!” (shield) <br/>
“Kay!” (filo) <br/>
 <br/>
Filo hid behind my back. <br/>
The Spirit Turtle opened its mouth and fired that intense thunder, intending to wipe out its own foot together with us! <br/>
I immediately changed to the Wrath Shield. <br/>
Anger ignited in the depths of my heart <br/>
 <br/>
“Master” (filo) <br/>
 <br/>
Filo's arms and legs were covered in black flames. <br/>
Not yet..... I could endure it. Because Raphtalia and Filo were lending me their strength. <br/>
There was a dazzling flash, which was immediately followed by a loud roar one beat later. <br/>
I held out the shield and defended with the Wrath Shield. <br/>
...... There wasn't any pain like the last time. <br/>
As expected from the Wrath Shield. I'm unharmed. <br/>
As I thought that, and waited for the Spirit Turtle's attack, I realised a time counter had appeared in the corner of my vision. <br/>
 <br/>
4 : 37 <br/>
 <br/>
This number that was decreasing every second...... <br/>
What the? <br/>
When the number fell to just below 4:30, the Spirit Turtle's attack ceased. <br/>
All right, I withstood it. And then I realised. Somehow strength wouldn’t enter my body. <br/>
 <br/>
“Master?” (filo) <br/>
 <br/>
What just occurred? <br/>
I checked my status. <br/>
......My SP became 0!? <br/>
What the? Why was my SP 0? <br/>
It couldn't be that that Spirit Turtle's attack also drains SP, can it? <br/>
I changed to the Soul Eater Shield and recovered SP by stealing it from the swarming familiars with a counter-attack. <br/>
 <br/>
I summoned Meteor Shield. <br/>
The number that appeared when I changed into the Wrath Shield has disappeared...... <br/>
I have a bad premonition. <br/>
Could it be that that number was the duration that the shield couldn't control me, or otherwise Filo, converted into a numerical value? <br/>
It seems like something bad would happen if it reached 0. <br/>
The Spirit Turtle regenerated its burnt foot and trampled down on us. <br/>
 <br/>
“No way!” (shield) <br/>
 <br/>
Like before, I seized the Spirit Turtle's foot to halt it. If I changed to Wrath Shield, the Dark Curse Burning S would activate from the neighbouring attacks and Filo would be caught up in it. I can't change it until the very last moment. <br/>
When I did, the Spirit Turtle took a breath as though to say it was waiting. <br/>
No matter how much, wasn't this a bit quick!? <br/>
 <br/>
Sweat dripped down my face unpleasantly. <br/>
It had an ability to drain SP.... would spit out a lightning attack with that recovered SP, and then sucked away the SP I acquired again. <br/>
I could remain uninjured with the Wrath Shield but my SP would be absorbed. I'd receive a lot of damage with the Soul Eater Shield but, because it invalidates the drain and steals SP, it would take time before the lightning attack could be fired. <br/>
So it's like this? <br/>
 <br/>
“Tsk! Shield Prison!” (shield) <br/>
 <br/>
I aimed at the Spirit Turtle's head and summoned a cage. <br/>
However, the cage was broken as soon as it appeared. <br/>
As expected, I can't encase something as large as that. <br/>
Well, it looks like I can't attack with Iron Maiden. <br/>
 <br/>
I withstood the next lightning attack by changing into the Wrath Shield. <br/>
However, I lost all the SP I had as compensation. <br/>
I changed back to the Soul Eater Shield to counter but........ <br/>
When I look to the vicinity, the familiars hadn't finished assembling together. <br/>
 <br/>
“Are you alright, Master?” (filo) <br/>
“Gu......” (shield) <br/>
 <br/>
Should I get on Filo and flee? <br/>
The power of that attack is no joke. If it misfired and hit the allied troops, it would have caused a serious loss. <br/>
I deployed Meteor Shield with the SP I just managed to recover. <br/>
 <br/>
“Filo, it might be painful but bear with it” (shield) <br/>
“Kay!” (filo) <br/>
 <br/>
I caught the lightning attack with Filo supporting me up. <br/>
 <br/>
“Guu.....” (shield) <br/>
 <br/>
The lightning attack pierced through me for about 30 seconds. <br/>
It's a pain I've never felt when I was in my original world. This feeling was like receiving an electric shock together with the pain of my whole body being roasted. <br/>
..... My consciousness took a leap. <br/>
I chanted recovery magic concurrently with supporting magic invoked by the troops behind me. <br/>
My wounds healed but I lost physical strength and accumulated fatigue during the time I was recovering from the injury. <br/>
 <br/>
“Filo's also gonna go” (filo) <br/>
“I'll leave it to you” (shield) <br/>
 <br/>
If Filo could blow away the head, that would buy us some time. <br/>
Filo took the stance for her special move, established her aim and attacked. <br/>
 <br/>
“Spiral Strike!” (filo) <br/>
 <br/>
Filo's assault arrived at the Spirit Turtle's throat and pierced through. <br/>
And yet, it may be because Raphtalia wasn't there but, it didn't manage to sever the head. <br/>
Before our eyes, the Spirit Turtle's wound repaired itself with an unpleasant tearing sound. <br/>
 <br/>
“Fuee....” (filo) <br/>
 <br/>
Filo sought refuge in my barrier as she landed and dropped her shoulders in fatigue. <br/>
The Spirit Turtle once again opened its mouth to spit a lightning attack. <br/>
Wha...... did the time for the next attack shrink because of the damage!? <br/>
 <br/>
“Filo, get away the next time this guy tries to stomp on us” (shield) <br/>
“Kay!” (filo) <br/>
 <br/>
I braced myself so that Filo could have time for her magic to recover; Filo's feathers bristled as she concentrated. <br/>
Speaking of which, the duration of the Spirit Turtle's lightning attack and the time it takes for Filo to accumulate magic power is equal. <br/>
The Spirit Turtle spat out its lightning attack and I changed to the Wrath Shield to resist it. <br/>
And then, the Spirit Turtle's blackened leg regenerated again and it attempted to stomp on us. <br/>
 <br/>
“Now's the time!” (shield) <br/>
“Oka~y!” (filo) <br/>
 <br/>
Filo retreated back at a high speed and I stopped Spirit Turtle's trampling with the Wrath Shield, then started running towards its face. <br/>
Dark Curse Burning S activated and black flames coiled around with me as the centre. <br/>
The Spirit Turtle's leg and face was thoroughly burned by the cursed flames. <br/>
 <br/>
“How's that!” (shield) <br/>
 <br/>
Dark Curse Burning S has an effect of diminishing recovery. It might be able to seal that miraculous regeneration power. <br/>
If that's the case then stalling for time will be easy. <br/>
However.....the blackened leg and part of the face regenerated as if nothing happened. <br/>
 <br/>
“――――――――――！” (turtle) <br/>
 <br/>
W-What vitality. <br/>
 <br/>
“Master” (filo) <br/>
“Yeah, I know” (shield) <br/>
 <br/>
I changed the Wrath Shield into the Soul Eater Shield to economise the time. <br/>
This will turn into.... quite a drawn-out battle. <br/>
 <br/>
Once again, I instructed Filo as I endured the lightning attack. <br/>
 <br/>
“Filo, please go and ask the queen, who's monitoring the timing, for the state of progress. This is quite relentless. Make them hurry up as much as possible” (shield) <br/>
“If I do that then Master will.....” (filo) <br/>
 <br/>
Filo replied with a voice that seemed like it would break into tears at any moment. <br/>
 <br/>
“I'll be fine.....” (shield) <br/>
“......okay” (filo) <br/>
 <br/>
That Spirit Turtle let out a mortifying cry, possibly because it couldn't steal any SP. <br/>
I think I can endure until the next discharge. <br/>
Filo kicked the enemy away. <br/>
 <br/>
“High Quick!” (filo) <br/>
 <br/>
With high speed, she ran down to where the queen was. <br/>
I materialised Meteor Shield with SP taken from the familiars, and repeated the action of pinning down the Spirit Turtle's foot. <br/>
It was difficult, because all the lightning attacks made the footing worse. There were fissures caused by the earthquakes as well as crater ruins. <br/>
 <br/>
This is harder than I thought..... <br/>
The Spirit Turtle's familiars forcefully attacked the barrier made by Meteor Shield. <br/>
.......If I didn't learn those strengthening methods from the other heroes, wouldn’t I have died? <br/>
Well, this situation is the fault of those other heroes. <br/>
 <br/>
<As one worthy of the origin of power, Filo is commanding: She's reread and understands the terms, blow away those creatures with a tornado of intense vacuum> <br/>
“Zweite Tornado!” (filo) <br/>
 <br/>
The familiars surrounding me were blown away by a tornado <br/>
 <br/>
“I'm back~!” (filo) <br/>
“How was it?” (shield) <br/>
“They're hurrying but said to hang in there for a bit longer” (filo) <br/>
“I see.......” (shield) <br/>
“Ah, also, this is medicine to recover stamina” (filo) <br/>
 <br/>
Filo took out some medicine from a bag she wasn't carrying when she left, and gave it to me. <br/>
It was a candy-like medicine. <br/>
When I put it in my mouth, there was a minty taste. I felt like a bit of strength had returned to me. <br/>
 <br/>
“And this was also set aside for Master's use” (filo) <br/>
“What?” (shield) <br/>
 <br/>
....it was a Lukor fruit [T/N: Remember that alcoholic grape thing? See ch93 for more detail] <br/>
 <br/>
“Yes, yes” (shield) <br/>
 <br/>
I also put that in my mouth. <br/>
......I felt more strength return than from the candy. When I checked the status magic, SP and MP was recovered.  <br/>
The Lukor fruit had a recovery effect. I'll remember that. <br/>
With this, the curtain closed on the long battle of suppressing the Spirit Turtle <br/>
I don't want to do this offense-defence thing a second time. <br/>
This repetition of sometimes using the Wrath Shield to resist, sometimes using the Soul Eater Shield to endure. <br/>
The barbarian's armour had become tattered here and there. <br/>
Its self-repairing was no longer able to catch up. <br/>
So intense. <br/>
 <br/>
“Haa......Haa......” (shield) <br/>
 <br/>
The Wrath Shield's time counter had dropped to below 0 : 30. Around this point, Filo also started tearing at her head seeming to be enduring something. <br/>
I also had a dark emotion taking over my heart, which made my mind start to become strange. <br/>
“M-Master....... Filo is already.......” (filo) <br/>
 <br/>
Filo, who wanted to release the anger that didn’t have anywhere to strike, and I. We're almost at the limit. <br/>
I can't change to Wrath Shield any more. <br/>
 <br/>
“I understand. I won't change it any more! Endure it!” (shield) <br/>
“Okay” (filo) <br/>
 <br/>
I endured Spirit Turtle's lightning attack with the Soul Eater Shield. <br/>
How many times have I endured this roasting sensation. I'm already fed up with just this. Should we flee? <br/>
Just when I thought that, the illumination was fired at last. <br/>
 <br/>
“Alright! Let's go!” (shield) <br/>
“Hooray! Filo will do her best!” (filo) <br/>
 <br/>
The Spirit Turtle regenerated its foot, and in the instant it tried to stomp down, I got on Filo's back and passed through its legs at high speed. <br/>
Tsk! That Spirit Turtle, it's trying to crush us with its whole body. <br/>
The Spirit Turtle's stomach drew nearer second by second, as the ceiling was lowering. <br/>
 <br/>
“High Quick!” (filo) <br/>
 <br/>
Filo changed her course midway using a high speed movement, turned her back and escaped from the front, dodging earthquakes by leaping over them and changed direction as she landed. <br/>
And with a huge leap, she jumped onto the Spirit Turtle's shell.
<br/>
