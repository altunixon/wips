Thank you, everyone, for purchasing the third volume of "Cooking with Wild Game".<br/>
Before I realize it, the number of volumes increased again.<br/>
This is thanks to all the readers who had supported me so far.<br/>
And this time, I’m very honored that the author of "School-Live!" Norimitsu Kaihō has written a comment on the book’s band.<br/>
Speaking of Norimitsu Kaihō sensei, the party scene he wrote for a certain anime left a deep impression on me.[4]<br/>
The female characters adorned their dresses and danced more energetically than usual, and displayed a sensual side of them, unlike their usual self. In my description of the wedding, that scene would show up in my mind from time to time.<br/>
However, the banquet in my story had an unexpected ending… Asuta fell asleep before the girls started to dance. When this part was posted online, one reader commented with: 「This main character is too dense!」.<br/>
Anyway, Asuta’s life in another world is going to start officially.<br/>
I hope everyone can look forward to future installments of this series.<br/>
Then, as usual, I want to thank my editor from Hobby JAPAN, the illustrator, all the staff involved in the publishing of this work, and the readers who bought this book.<br/>
I hope to see everyone in the next volume!<br/>
