Title explanation: Trial Conqueror<br/>
A Title given to those who have conquered a difficult trial given to them by a god. In most cases, these trials are given by gods such as Alda, the god of law and fate, and those who conquer these trials are respected by the gods who gave them the trials and the people who knew about the trials.<br/>
In Vandalieu’s case, he conquered the Trial of Zakkart imposed upon him by Gufadgarn, the evil god of labyrinths, so this effect is limited to only within the Boundary Mountain Range.<br/>
Many who possess this Title go on to live complicated lives with drastic events after they are noticed by the gods, but it is unclear as to whether this is an effect of the Title itself.<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
Title explanation: Transgressor<br/>
A Title given to a being who creates something new by transgressing and disturbing the boundaries between good and evil, between god and man, between one world and another, between man and monster, between one region and another. It symbolizes a trickster of myths and legends, and a cultural hero.<br/>
One who possesses this Title cannot be said to be absolutely good, but it also cannot be said that they are evil.<br/>
In Lambda’s mythology, Zuruwarn, the god of space and creation, has often played this role, which conflicts with Alda, the god of law and fate who rules over order, and his followers.<br/>
The Title provides bonuses to boundary-transgressing acts… such as the appearance of previously-unknown Jobs, acquiring unknown Skills and inventing new things. On the other hand, it also has the side-effect of making encounters with unusual problems more frequent, but those who possess this Title are unlikely to be the type of person who would struggle in such situations.<br/>
However, as this Title is almost always granted by the gods, there are almost no humans in history who have acquired this Title while they were alive. Because of this, most people do not understand its meaning and effects.<br/>
In Vandalieu’s case, he is transgressing and disturbing the boundary between life and death in addition to the above-mentioned boundaries. To those who believe in the current world order, he would be considered evil, but he is unmistakably good to those who receive the blessings of his actions.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
Skill explanation: Superior Skills<br/>
Skills have a Level limit of 10. Superior Skills are Skills that have passed that limit and become new Skills with new names. Their bonuses, effects and the martial skills and spells they make possible are incomparably superior… or so it is widely considered.<br/>
They are generally awakened in those well-accomplished masters of combat or expert mages who have studied over a long period of time; there are no humans who innately possess a superior Skill.<br/>
The most common name change that Skills undergo is the word “King” being added to the original Skill’s name. (For example, the ‘Sword King’ Borkus’s Swordsmanship becoming Sword King Technique.)<br/>
There are also superior Passive Skills that have no relationship with the Skill owner’s actual ability, such as Monstrous Strength, which transforms from Superhuman Strength, and Super Rapid Regeneration, which transforms from Rapid Regeneration. These are individuals that innately possess these superior Skills, but they are almost always monsters.<br/>
As monsters are inferior to humans in the aspect of handing down and preserving their abilities, there are almost none that awaken superior Skills other than these Passive Skills. This is one of the advantages that humans have over monsters.<br/>
However, this does not apply to humans that acquire superior Skills and then become Undead, Vida’s races or true Colossi and Elder Dragons.<br/>
Incidentally, a Skill becoming a superior Skill is called an awakening.<br/>
Because the acquisition of a superior Active Skill requires long years of training and a talent in the relevant area of expertise, it is thought that there are almost none who possess multiple.<br/>
(Due to this, Bone Man is considered an irregular existence in human society.)<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
Vandalieu Zakkart – Dhampir (Dark Elf), 10 years old, male<br/>
Now a teenager, he has become the emperor who rules the area within the Boundary Mountain Range, had an audience with Vida and the other gods, and conquered the Trial of Zakkart, acquiring a surname and gaining an evil god as a new companion. (He later froze in shock upon learning that ten-year-old children were still not yet considered teenagers.)<br/>
<br/>
TLN: In Japanese, ages are usually grouped in groups of 10 years – 0-9, 10-19, 20-29, etc. It is apparently surprising to Vandalieu that the English word “teenager” does not correspond exactly to the 10-19 category.<br/>
<br/>
As of the end of the 8th volume, he is waiting for the resurrection of Darcia, who is growing inside a capsule.<br/>
Inside the Trial of Zakkart, he distributed his divine protection among his close companions and personally developed even further, awakening multiple superior Skills.<br/>
He tamed countless Demons through fear (though he did this unconsciously); these Demons represent a fighting force capable of destroying a large nation without the protection of S and A-class adventurers… though it is unclear as to whether Demons would faithfully obey Vandalieu’s commands when they are separated from him.<br/>
He has acquired the Disease Demon Job, and through the Group Thought Processing Skill, it has become possible for even transformed objects from his own body to possess his thoughts. Combined with the Long-distance Control Skill, he can manipulate Demon King fragments released from his body like homing missiles.<br/>
… When fired using Artillery Technique, the projectile speed of the fragments is too fast and they reach their destination before he can do any manipulation, so this ability is currently limited to use with the Throwing Skill.<br/>
Outside of combat, this ability is useful for manipulating pathogens generated from his own blood to make them infect only targets that he designates. The result is a 100% natural (self-created), ecologically-friendly pesticide.<br/>
His acquisition of Earth’s Dark Gods’ Divine Protection has influenced the Jobs that he is able to change into. However, he does not know what kind of deities the gods of Earth are and he only possesses a partial knowledge of Earth’s myths and legends, so he does not understand the true meaning of the divine protection.<br/>
However, this does not mean that he is not grateful. He once offered hayashi rice to the statue of Zuruwarn, the one who had negotiated for this divine protection.<br/>
Vandalieu is living a fulfilling life, having gained new friends such as Oniwaka of the Kijin nation, and succeeded in raising a second child (Quinn).<br/>
At this point in time, one month after the conquering of the Trial of Zakkart, he is waiting for the members of the Storm of Tyranny. In the meantime, he is dealing with the work and domestic affairs that had accumulated in Talosheim during his absence, putting efforts into the development of the various nations and testing whether the effects of Blood Potion can be improved by dissolving the Demon King’s claws in it. He is also spending time around the capsule inside which Darcia’s body is developing, doing prenatal-care-like things. In other words, he is talking to the capsule.<br/>
Rather than being a heartwarming scene between a mother and child, it looks more like a mad scientist talking to a mysterious artificial life-form. The presence of Gufadgarn and Luciliano only adds to that effect, but… not a single one of them have noticed this.<br/>
He had once wondered, Is Gufadgarn really happy serving me, considering that I am not actually Zakkart himself? I don’t have his memories or anything. Now, he does not pay much attention to this, as Gufadgarn herself does not seem to mind.<br/>
He has been summoned for audiences in the Divine Realms of great gods, an event that is rare even in the entire, long history of Lambda. However, his religious views have not changed drastically. He simply has a few religious customs in his everyday life, such as putting his hands together before and after each of his three daily meals.<br/>
But as he has become aware that Vida and the other gods do indeed love him and his companions, his sense of faith in them has grown deeper.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
(adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({});<br/>
<br/>
What troubles him these days is the question of what kind of Undead to make out of the corpse of Martina, which he brought back with him from the Trial of Zakkart. He has been considering asking Luciliano or Legion (Isis) to remodel her.<br/>
 <br/>
Darcia – Race unknown, female, currently undergoing reincarnation<br/>
The powerless spirit of the Dark Elf who was Vandalieu’s mother. She was an adventurer while alive, using a bow and spiritual magic. However, her abilities were only that of a D-class adventurer; she was not particularly strong.<br/>
But at this point in time, a new body is being created for her, using the root of life that was one of the relics left behind by Zakkart, as well as the materials of high-Rank monsters, fragments of the Demon King, an Orichalcum skeleton and Vida’s crystallized blood.<br/>
Her mind has been summoned to Vida’s Divine Realm, where she is receiving direct training from heroic spirits that left their names in myths and legends.<br/>
It is considered to be certain that when she is resurrected, she will have transformed into something new, neither her body nor mind confined within the limits of a Dark Elf.<br/>
Perhaps because she has spent about ten years simply watching Vandalieu develop, she is not very aware of the fact that she herself is growing stronger. It can be assumed that her sense of development is so warped that she would not consider herself to have become stronger unless she becomes Rank 10 or an A-class adventurer.<br/>
 <br/>
Gufadgarn – Evil god, ? years old, hermaphroditic<br/>
The evil god of labyrinths, previously a part of the Demon King’s army. She was blessed with the unusual destiny of becoming a god from a member of a primitive race that moves solely on their natural instincts. However, because of her origin, the natural instincts that she lost left behind a sense of emptiness that was hard to fill. She adored and worshiped Zakkart for being able to fill that emptiness.<br/>
She possessed a nihilistic personality; she was the type of god who obeyed any order (including those of the Demon King) because she could not see any reason to disobey them.<br/>
Ever since she came to adore Zakkart, her sense of values and beliefs became based upon him, her worship of him becoming the center of her personality.<br/>
Before that, she saw no value in anything in the world, not even herself. But after meeting Zakkart, she realized that the world was amazing just by existing and that life was a beautiful thing.<br/>
However, with Zakkart’s destruction at the hands of the Demon King Guduranis, she lost the core of her personality and entered a state of mental anguish.<br/>
She was focused on taking revenge against the Demon King during the war against the Demon King’s army. She cooperated with Vida, the goddess who had chosen Zakkart. She served the Vampire True Ancestor after Vida gave birth to him. After Vida was defeated by Alda and sealed away, Gufadgarn wielded her power to help the members of Vida’s races that had fled to the region within the Boundary Mountain Range. Gufadgarn did all of this in an effort to distract herself from her sense of emptiness.<br/>
But in the end, she could not do so. Unable to bear the emptiness any longer, she fell into slumber.<br/>
However, a hundred years ago, she received Divine Messages from Vida and Ricklent. Misinterpreting them, she created the Trial of Zakkart and began Teleporting around the world to search for Zakkart’s successor.<br/>
As a result, countless followers of Alda faced the trial and lost their lives, though this hadn’t been a part of Gufadgarn’s intentions… She always wondered why they kept misunderstanding the Dungeon’s purpose and ventured inside despite the sign that she had created.<br/>
However, she didn’t want endless waves of capable adventurers and believers of Alda entering the Dungeon with the objective of destroying Zakkart’s relics, so she did not post any further explanation outside the Dungeon beyond the sign.<br/>
She has generally treated the followers of the gods of Vida’s faction with courtesy, listening to them and taking action based on their circumstances. However, she is rather impolite towards the gods other than Vida.<br/>
Among Vandalieu’s companions, she considers herself as a newcomer and believes that it is only natural for her to show them respect.<br/>
It is thought that the behaviors described above are a result of her not having a strong sense that she is a divine being, and because she respected Zakkart’s past of having worked for a long time as the second manager of a small-town factory.<br/>
However, as her mental structure is fundamentally different from that of a human, she often misinterprets things. This causes no small number of incidents where she becomes a “polite, crazy troublemaker” towards those around her.<br/>
As a god, she rules over the space attribute, and her original appearance is one that contradicts the laws of physics in Lambda; she was a spider or scorpion made of blocks in the shape of equilateral heptahedrons.<br/>
At the request of the first Zakkart, she took the form of a human-shaped Golem, and now she inhabits a vessel that resembles an Elf girl.<br/>
The vessel is not actually an Elf girl; it is an object disguised as an Elf girl, created with one of his Dungeon’s functions.<br/>
Gufadgarn is recognized as a girl and participates in the bust ranking.<br/>
 <br/>
Zadiris – Ghoul Wizard High Princess, 299 years old, female<br/>
The protagonist’s magic instructor who has now become a princess. She is the oldest female mage among Talosheim’s Ghouls. She even has a grandchild.<br/>
She is developing rapidly as a mage, but she spends her days troubled by the fact that she is a princess despite the fact that she is the oldest Ghoul and has a granddaughter.<br/>
She is envious of Quinn and Eisen, as they acquired race titles with Queen and Empress when their Ranks increased. She is experimenting with various things using trial and error in order to figure out how she can graduate from being a princess, but this has produced no results so far.<br/>
However, she is popular as a magical girl among the young children of Talosheim including her own granddaughter Jadal, and the transformation staff that Vandalieu made functions exceptionally and cannot be replaced.<br/>
Over time, she has acquired the ‘Magical Girl’ Title and the ‘Magical Girl’ Job appeared during her next Job-change. There weren’t any other available Jobs that she could change to, so she chose it.<br/>
In fact, the thing she is most worried about might be the fact that she has started to find herself thinking, “Maybe this is not so bad after all.”<br/>
In terms of her ability, it is now difficult for even an A-class adventurer to defeat her. Although she has not awoken any superior Skills, she is a powerful mage.<br/>
Incidentally, her race title and Job contained “princess,” but she hasn’t grown any shorter, nor has her body become any less womanly. Also, she has acquired a mysterious (?) divine protection.<br/>

Basdia – Ghoul Amazoness ■■■■, 27 (33) years old, female<br/>
She had hit a wall in her development, but when she left the Trial of Zakkart, she had become Rank 10. However, for some reason, she has kept quiet about this and not told anyone.<br/>
She seems to be troubled over something; there is an unusual sorrow in her eyes when she watches her mother Zadiris from behind.<br/>
But I have to reveal it eventually, she thinks as she looks at her daughter Jadal, who excitedly shouts, “Grandma is a magical girl!”<br/>
After the conquering of the Trial of Zakkart, she has spent less time hunting and more time with Jadal and helping her friend who is also a mother, Bilde, raise her child. She interacts with the other Ghoul women who are raising their small children as siblings with different mothers while scolding her father Vigaro, looking at him sternly and saying, “I think you should do some better family planning.”<br/>
She is respected by the Ghoul women who were living in the Sauron region and the region within the Boundary Mountain Range. Why do they respect me instead of Mother, our elder? she wonders, but even so, she sometimes hosts lectures and oversees the training of those who apply for them.<br/>
Perhaps because of this, there have recently been other Ghouls becoming Ghoul Amazonesses.<br/>

Vigaro – Ghoul Soul Tyrant, 173 years old, male<br/>
He became a Ghoul Astral Tyrant and although he is not an Undead, he acquired the Spirit Form Skill, which he uses to create a fifth arm that he uses to hold a shield or for stability and mobility by gripping the ground.<br/>
After that, a vertically tall, thin Vandalieu appeared in his dreams once more inside the Trial of Zakkart, offering a piece of flesh that was dripping with blood. Once Vigaro ate it, he gained a mysterious (?) divine blessing. His Rank increased and his race changed, and he is now a Rank 11 Ghoul Soul Tyrant.<br/>
After that, he changed Jobs to a previously undiscovered Job called ‘Dark Axeman.’<br/>
He has awakened Death Lion Axe Technique, a superior Skill of Axe Technique, and his strength in battle is surpassing A-class and entering the realm of S-class.<br/>
He sees the progress of the magical girl Zadiris and continues training hard to reach new heights… He has become even more popular with the women because of his strength, but Basdia angrily told him that he should do more proper family planning, so he has not put his hands on any new partners… and he will likely not do so for another twenty years or so.<br/>

Borkus – Zombie Legend Hero, male<br/>
Borkus’s Rank has increased to a legendary race title after having fought with the incarnation of an evil god. But he struggles more with the unexpected wedding proposals being thrown at him than he did with the evil god’s incarnation.<br/>
He was an A-class adventurer and reasonably popular with women while he was alive, but that was after diplomatic relations began between the former Talosheim and the Hartner Duchy. Before that, he was a master swordsman who was considered one of the five most powerful warriors in the nation, but as the former Talosheim was a city state with a population of only about five thousand, it was not an environment where men took multiple wives.<br/>
Thus, even though he was an A-class adventurer, he was not used to this aspect of the occupation that other A-class adventurers of human societies would experience.<br/>
His current fighting strength is unquestionably equivalent to that of an S-class adventurer.<br/>
Incidentally, the Vandalieu that appeared in his dream apparently had normal proportions, but had grown to be the same size as Borkus himself.<br/>

Jeena – Zombie High Saint, female<br/>
The ‘Saint of Healing’ who lives a fulfilling life, being part of activities such as organizing the first bodybuilding competition in Talosheim and accompanying Vandalieu’s party in the Trial of Zakkart. Her Rank increased inside the trial, and she is now a Rank 11 Zombie High Saint.<br/>
Vida, the goddess she worships, has been revived, so she believes that Talosheim has at least a thousand years of future prosperity guaranteed.<br/>
But she does not voice this opinion, as she would be scolded by Vandalieu, whom she refers to as “Your-Majesty-kun,” and Chezare, who serves as both prime minister and general.<br/>
After returning from the Trial of Zakkart, she has been spending her time reexamining the judging criteria for bodybuilding to improve its quality as a competition and stopping Nuaza, who seems to not be learning his lesson, from constructing more statues of Vandalieu.<br/>
The reason she stops him is because she prefers the small Vandalieu to big ones.<br/>
Incidentally, the Vandalieu that appeared when she received her mysterious (?) divine protection was small enough to fit in the palm of her hand, but had split into countless numbers.<br/>
 <br/>
Zandia – Zombie High Princess, female<br/>
The old Talosheim’s Second Princess who reached Rank 10 and became a Zombie High Princess inside the Trial of Zakkart.<br/>
Her personally-tailored transformation staff is not yet complete, but she will likely be the next magical girl after Zadiris. She does not have any objections to transformation itself, but she wants to become more adult-like in the future.<br/>
She ranks low on the bust rankings and has been deluding herself into thinking that it was a good thing because she was a scarce commodity, but her position has been put in danger by Gufadgarn’s vessel.<br/>
Zakkart-san, why didn’t you ask for a beautiful woman instead of a beautiful girl?! she thinks internally, blaming the champion… though this is likely just her venting her frustration, which she regrets afterwards.<br/>
Once she becomes a reasonably capable magical girl, she intends to have her transformation staff remodeled to be more queen-like rather than princess-like, hopefully becoming more adult-like when her Rank increases again.<br/>
 <br/>
Eleanora – Abyssal Vampire Duchess, 13 years old (20 years old at time of Vampire transformation, 33 years old in total), female<br/>
Having accompanied Vandalieu in the Trial of Zakkart and acquired (what is assumed to be) his divine protection, she is enjoying the spring of life in this world – no, an everlasting summer. She and Isla are rivals as always, but all things considered, she is living a fulfilling life.<br/>
Her only worry was her past service of a Vampire faction serving an evil god, but she is at ease after finding out that neither the gods in Vida’s Resting Grounds nor Gufadgarn are concerned about it.<br/>
As Vandalieu is a Dhampir, Eleanora has been mistaken for his mother several times, so she is looking forward to Darcia’s resurrection in that regard… though if one thinks about it, it is obvious that nothing would change and she would continue to be mistaken for his mother unless Darcia’s new body happens to resemble Vandalieu very strongly.<br/>
Darcia was a Dark Elf while she was alive, while Vandalieu could pass for a half-Elf if he covered his eyes; his skin so white that it looks as if he is ill. The only physical feature she has in common with him is the one bluish-purple eye.<br/>
Eleanora accompanies Vandalieu with the training of his Abyss Skill by using her Charming Demon Eyes; each time she does, their effects are reflected and she is charmed by Vandalieu… although there is little change, as she is already charmed by him of her own will.<br/>
Lately, Zadiris has spoken a curse to her, saying that she should become a Vampire Princess. Eleanora was twenty years old when she became a Vampire, so she wants to be more like a lady or even a queen, and she wishes to avoid wearing a transformation costume covered in ribbons and frills. However, she does not dislike the idea to the point that she would reject it under any circumstances.<br/>
If Vandalieu-sama desires it, then it matters not, is what she thinks about the matter… though this is also partially due to the fact that the transformation staves are highly effective in function and not just for show.<br/>
The truth is Isla is thinking the same thing, but Eleanora is not yet aware of this.<br/>
Incidentally, her ability is closing in on that of her parent, the Pure-breed Vampire Birkyne, but she has almost forgotten of Birkyne’s existence entirely at this point. Her thoughts of him amount to, “Come to think of it, there was a guy by that name.”<br/>
She is more focused on being proud of the fact that her Self-enhancement: Subordination has awakened into the superior Skill, Super Self-enhancement: Subordination.<br/>

Isla – Vampire Marquess Zombie, female<br/>
She is the captain of the female order of knights called the Dark Night Knights’ Order, but in the 8th volume, she left command of the knights’ order to an adjutant in order to accompany Vandalieu’s party in the Trial of Zakkart. The reason for this is simply because she wanted to go.<br/>
She has received a Magic Item chain to attach to the collar that Vandalieu gave her, increasing her impression of a loyal dog. Vandalieu even pulled on it to stop her in the Trial of Zakkart.<br/>
This is something that she is proud of; she boasted about it to her subordinates after the party returned from the Dungeon, and she uses this as a source of morale, telling them that following after her isn’t an unachievable dream if they start making their own accomplishments.<br/>
Incidentally, the morale of her subordinates did actually increase from this.<br/>
Some of the Pure-breed Vampires shuddered upon hearing this, reacting with something along the lines of, “Eww, I don’t know if it’s because they’ve become Undead, but the ones with their (Ternecia and Gubamon’s) blood in them are all perverts.”<br/>
However, Isla is not constantly strange; she apparently behaved seriously as a senior should when she was helping Pauvina, Privel and the others with their leveling.<br/>
She is one of the people who have received (what is being called) the magical girl’s curse, but considering how painful this would be due to how old she physically looks, she seriously wishes to avoid this… She currently has the appearance of an evil female manager, but this is apparently not painful to her.<br/>
However, she is also willing to gladly become one “if Vandalieu-sama desires it.” But even if this came to pass, she would likely refuse to part with her chain and collar.<br/>
Incidentally, she has acquired the Mount Skill, intending to use it in any future ceremonies that may take place.<br/>

 <br/>
Bellmond – Abyssal Vampire Duchess (forest-monkey-type Beast-person), female<br/>
Vandalieu’s female Vampire steward. Always carries an hourglass, as she serves as judge for quarrels between Eleanora and Isla. By having body parts transplanted from a Live-Dead made from her parent, the Pure-breed Vampire Ternecia, she has gained a voluptuous body that she is now accustomed to, and she is able to carry out nimble defensive movements.<br/>
Perhaps because of this, she has acquired the Kunoichi Job… She was confused by the fact that Kunoichi wear fishnet tights, but she has accepted it, thinking that it must be a traditional thing.<br/>
However, it seems likely that once she starts wearing them, she will do so under her clothes.<br/>
She is generally cool-headed, suppressing the fighting between Eleanora and Isla before they escalate out of control. However, it seems that she has realized that her appearance is the youngest among the three of them. She now wonders if she is being overly conscious about this.<br/>
Incidentally, due to this role of hers, she believes that she is the most ordinary out of the three Vampires.<br/>
Her tail was cut off when she was sexually assaulted before becoming a Vampire; Vandalieu later transplanted a new tail from a monkey-type monster. It is an extremely robust weapon, but at the same time, it is very sensitive. When she tenses it, one swing with her Vampiric strength can destroy even an enemy clad in Adamantite armor, but when it is relaxed, she is weak to things like having it pinched by a crab’s pincers or having it brushed by someone.<br/>
She has been deeply impressed by the immense courtesy that Gufadgarn has shown to both Vandalieu and her despite being a god. I must learn from this example, she thinks.<br/>
However, due to her high-Level Housework Skill, she does not doubt that she is superior as a servant.<br/>
She has also received the magical girl’s curse, but she is not seriously worried about this, as she believes that being a kunoichi and being a magical girl are mutually exclusive.<br/>
She has recently come to a sudden realization that her strength is becoming close to that of a Pure-breed Vampire, and thinks that it is perhaps about time to discreetly ask Vandalieu for a chain and collar.<br/>
<br/>
Pauvina – Half-Noble Orc, 6 years old, female<br/>
She would be nine years old if her age were to be converted into human years; she will turn about ten in human years this year. She is likely the youngest person to ever face the Trial of Zakkart.<br/>
However, her strength is already equivalent to that of an A-class adventurer.<br/>
She is moved by Zadiris’s transformation and longs to be a magical girl. She pestered Vandalieu and received a prototype transformation staff along with her good friends Rapiéçage and Yamata. However, despite using it during battle, the Magical Girl Job has not yet appeared for her.<br/>
Thus, she has recently started learning magic. It seems that she is aiming for Apprentice Mage or Mage in her next Job change.<br/>
She can transform by using three of the prototype transformation staves that were designed for Zadiris, but her appearance when doing so is that of a metallic Golem, nothing like that of a magical girl.<br/>
 <br/>
Rapiéçage – Lifeless Chimera Zombie, female<br/>
A composite Undead who has gone from being a Zombie to a new race called “Lifeless Chimera.” She is an Undead who was originally cobbled together from separate parts, but now, all of her body parts have been acknowledged as a part of her, meaning that they will grow back with Rapid Regeneration if they are cut off.<br/>
Perhaps she has reached a new stage as an Undead; she has acquired the Strengthen Attribute Values: Creator Skill, which increases her Attribute Values when she is near her creator, Vandalieu.<br/>
It seems that she holds interest in being a magical girl like her good friend Pauvina, but it appears that she has simply taken a liking to the act of transforming.<br/>
She is able to transform with three of the transformation staves made for Zadiris, but her appearance becomes that of a metallic humanoid monster. If a transformation staff was specifically made for her, then her appearance would be… more like a monstrous girl than a magical one.<br/>
 <br/>
Yamata – Orochi, female<br/>
Yamata’s Rank increased inside the Trial of Zakkart, causing her to become a monster that is likely related to the Yamata-no-Orochi, who appears in the legends of another world left behind in Lambda by the champions.<br/>
Perhaps because she has recently become able to use the brains of the female upper halves that have been transplanted onto her necks, she has become able to use beginner-level magic. Considering that the Hydra that makes up the base of her body is considered one of the least intelligent species of Dragon and the fact that Undead are far less intelligent than they were while they were alive in most cases, this is extraordinary progress.<br/>
She can transform into a mysterious metallic monster by using over ten transformation staves, but if a transformation staff was ever created specifically for her… things would be chaotic, as she would become a multi-headed snake with nine upper-body-halves of magical girls as her heads.<br/>
Also, the person who would have to work ten times as hard to create such a staff would likely collapse from exhaustion.<br/>
 <br/>
Luciliano – Human, 32 years old, male<br/>
A man in his thirties who has become slightly tired from his sense of curiosity being over-stimulated. This is due to an increase in the presence of beings that are unknown to the legends and knowledge of human society around his master Vandalieu.<br/>
However, he joyfully screams at himself that there is no time to rest, as it is possible that Darcia’s resurrection process and the remodeling surgery of the corpses brought back from the Trial of Zakkart will be left to him.<br/>
However, he does not intend to make a bride for himself.<br/>
After being forced to accompany Jeena and the others in leveling, acquiring a Title named “Emperor’s Personal Disciple” and gaining a mysterious (?) divine protection, he has developed in terms of fighting ability as well. However, he believes that his true duty is that of a researcher, not an adventurer.<br/>
In terms of fighting ability, he would be able to quickly reach B or A-class if he were to return to human society, but it seems that he is not interested in that.<br/>
He is interested in the new item created by Vandalieu, the transformation staff. He is also highly interested in the previously-unknown “Magical Girl” Job and Zadiris’s new race Title that she likely gained due to this item, so he is running observations on her in parallel with his other research.<br/>
However, it seems that he is not interested in becoming a magical middle-aged man himself.<br/>
Additionally, during his observation process, he makes sketches of Zadiris while looking at her as if mocking her, so she often gives him sulking looks. However, he is convincing her to cooperate by telling her, “The possibility of finding a way for you to become a queen rather than a princess when your Rank increases is not zero.”<br/>
Incidentally, there are some who wish to purchase his sketches, but they are for research and not for sale.<br/>
He currently holds the Magic Warrior Job, which is often taken by those who use both magic and physical techniques in battle, but this is because he needed a Job with high Vitality and Stamina growth in order to survive when Jeena forced him to accompany her into B-class Dungeons.<br/>
He is now thinking of acquiring the No-Attribute Mage Job next, aiming to acquire the Hollow King Magic Skill that Vandalieu awakened.<br/>

Bone Man – Skeleton Blade Lord, male<br/>
Successfully increased Rank and became a Rank 11 Skeleton Blade Lord in the Trial of Zakkart.<br/>
It was thought that ‘Emperor’ would come after ‘Duke,’ but he refrained from acquiring this race title because of Vandalieu.<br/>
Ten years ago, Vandalieu created him for the purpose of going to look for Darcia because she hadn’t come home. Thus, like Knochen, he is overjoyed about Darcia’s resurrection.<br/>
It has been one of Bone Man’s deepest wishes to see Darcia resurrected and returned to Vandalieu’s side.<br/>
Now that this wish is coming true, he is focused on becoming stronger so that he can defeat enemies to protect his master and his master’s mother. However, he has encountered a developmental wall and become frustrated.<br/>
He is currently leveling up and keeping an eye on Darcia while spending his spare time cleaning the moss off the scales of his beloved mount that he left behind, the Dragon Zombie Leo.<br/>

Knochen – Bone Palace<br/>
Immediately after clearing the Trial of Zakkart, Knochen went from being a Rank 10 Grand Bone Fort to a Rank 11 Bone Palace, becoming even more enormous. By adding countless Demon Bones to its body inside the Trial of Zakkart, it has become not only larger, but sturdier and more sinister-looking as well.<br/>
It is made from Bone Bird, Bone Wolf, Bone Monkey and Bone Bear, who were made for the same reason as Bone Man, so it is truly happy about Darcia’s resurrection.<br/>
In a way, its purpose in life has been fulfilled, so it is now focusing on nothing but gathering more bones and increasing its defensive capability. Its next objective is to become an enormous, airborne, mobile palace.<br/>
<br/>
Sam – Nightmare Lord Carriage, male<br/>
After returning from the Trial of Zakkart, his Rank increased and he gained a race title describing a lord of nightmares spoken of in legends.  However, it can be assumed that it is related to Vandalieu appearing in the dreams of many rather than being related to legends.<br/>
Like his daughters Saria and Rita, he was an Undead created after Bone Man and the others, so he is extremely moved by Darcia’s resurrection.<br/>
… He is happy that with this, he is finally able to take care of his Bocchan’s mother, Darcia-sama. She was only a spirit up until now, so he did not truly feel like he was serving her even when he was transporting her around. Even Rita and Saria were not able to serve her directly, so as servants, this seems to have left something to desire.<br/>
Trained by the harsh environments inside the Trial of Zakkart, his Comfort Maintenance Skill has reached Level 10. Now, even in the middle of a blizzard, it would be possible to have an entirely ordinary experience inside Sam’s carriage.<br/>

Iris Bearheart – Obscene-Majin – Succubus Cursed Sword Knight (Human), 20 years old, female<br/>
The former Liberating Princess Knight who was transformed into a Succubus through a ceremony conducted by the Majin king Godwin after she was fatally wounded.<br/>
Her goal was to liberate her homeland, the Sauron Duchy, from the Amid Empire. However, she was betrayed by the Orbaume Kingdom’s government and the new Duke Sauron, and it was publicly announced that she had died.<br/>
It wasn’t that there weren’t reasons that this was done to Iris, but she is at ease knowing that Cubas and the others who supported the resistance are being protected and supported inside the former Scylla territory by Vandalieu.<br/>
She is alarmed by the fact that she is building debts faster than she can repay them, but she believes she can simply take a thousand or two thousand years to repay them now that she no longer has a limited lifespan.<br/>
In the Majin nation, she is Godwin’s daughter, and she has gathered much attention as the first person to be transformed by a Blood Cocoon ritual carried out by a Battle-Majin in a long time. However, as she has only lived for twenty years, she is treated not even like a girl, but like a toddler. She is in the kind of social position where if she is walking on her own, someone might call out to her and ask if she is lost.<br/>
Iris understands that she is not being made fun of and that she is being watched with kindness, but she is unhappy with the different sense of values that Majin have compared to humans. She is working hard so that she will be treated as an adult even among the Majin.<br/>
As a result of her hard work, she has become accustomed to her transformed body, but she has not yet successfully tamed a Demon.<br/>
After she raised her abilities so that she could face the Trial of Zakkart, she went through numerous experiences, Job changes and Rank increases inside. As a result, her strength compares favorably to that of an A-class adventurer.<br/>
Vandalieu suggested that he share some of the large number of Demons that he tamed, but Iris refused, saying that she would never stop being treated like a child if she kept depending on him.<br/>
She was under the impression that she is unable to tame Demons because she is lacking in ability, which is causing the Demons to look down on her… Later, Godwin told her, “No, Demons are only really scared of Vandalieu. Apart from him, they look down on the whole world.” Upon learning this, Iris regretted her hasty decision a little.<br/>
Nemesis George, the spirit of Iris’s father which inhabits an Orichalcum holy sword, is on good terms with her Majin parent Godwin. The two fathers get into disagreements as they passionately make plans to raise Iris into a good woman.<br/>
Iris is currently a Rank 9 Succubus Cursed Sword Knight, a race title that was undiscovered even among the Majin race, as Undead were previously not tamable.<br/>
She has acquired the Demon Tamer Job, but she is still increasing its level, unable to tame any Demons.<br/>

<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Godwin – Battle-Majin – Absolute Diablo King, several thousand years old, male<br/>
The king of the Majin nation, crowned by Xerxes, the god of battle flags. He possesses blue skin, golden eyes, two thick horns, a pair of wings and a tail. He loves battle more than anything, but he has recently been very passionate about child-raising.<br/>
He has become too passionate; he has been neglecting his paperwork and his officials and secretary are always reprimanding him.<br/>
He has faced the Trial of Zakkart multiple times, having started when it first appeared, and Gufadgarn remembers him. However, although Gufadgarn was impressed by Godwin’s tremendous strength in battle, he knew that Godwin could not be Zakkart’s successor, given the timing of the Divine Message that he received. Thus, Gufadgarn paid little attention to Godwin.<br/>
Considering that Vandalieu was able to quell the fighting spirit of the Demons through nothing but pure fear, Godwin hopes that Vandalieu could take over the role of Majin king so that he can retire before the end of his term, but he knows that Vandalieu is busy now so he intends to try asking again in ten years or so.<br/>
However, perhaps because of this, he has nightmares of an enormous severed head rolling towards him from the distance. He has a feeling that the giant severed head resembles Vandalieu, and since it is always approaching him, he asks himself whether this is his punishment for not doing any work.<br/>
He interacts with the kings of other nations as well, and although he is close to them and known as a “troublemaker who can’t be relied on except for in the worst of situations” and a “no-good, mischievous old man,” he is not a leader and not relied upon.<br/>
The previous Noble Orc emperor, the queen of Zanalpadna Donaderis and the Dark Elf king Gizan are more reliable and more worthy of being called a leader.<br/>
As a result of long years of battle, he has reached Rank 14. Even if the gods directed him to battle against a heroic spirit, he has a good chance of winning that battle. Before Vandalieu and his companions appeared, he had been planning to spend several decades enjoying his freedom before joining his ancestors in Vida’s Resting Grounds.<br/>
It has become difficult for him to increase his Level; this cannot be helped, as he no longer feels any difficulty defeating even Dungeon Bosses.<br/>
He is a powerful Majin king even when compared to the other Majin kings who came before him. Excluding the gods themselves, and the Pure-breed Vampires and his ancestors who slumber in Vida’s Resting Grounds, he is the most powerful individual within the Boundary Mountain Range. However, the battle-oriented champions during the age of the gods would have considered him nothing more than “a small fry who is a little stronger than the rest”… Which is why he has been dreaming of the beginning of the final war against Alda’s forces since about a thousand years ago.<br/>

<br/>
Veld – Heroic spirit (Was a Dhampir in life), male<br/>
One of Vida’s heroic spirits.<br/>
When he was alive, he defeated a nation that was under the control of Vampires and became its king, thus becoming a Dhampir mercenary-king. After his death, this achievement allowed him to be summoned to Vida’s side, but Vida had already been half-sealed away by Alda’s divine authority. As a result, he spent tens of thousands of years wandering in Vida’s Resting Grounds in an undefined state.<br/>
He experienced many painful events in his life, and was the leader of a band of rough mercenaries, but his experience as a king has given him a calm personality. With his time spent as a demi-heroic spirit added to that, he became a truly wise man. Since the gods in Vida’s faction and their believers have too much freedom, he is trying to improve his pessimistic nature.<br/>
The nation he ruled has already fallen to ruin, but he thinks it only natural that nations do so after ten thousand years or so, so he is not concerned about it. However, he is slightly concerned about the fact that the direct cause of his nation’s destruction was a revolution and coup d’état started by Zuruwarn’s followers.<br/>
He feels sorry that his descendant became a tyrant and caused trouble, even though it was over a dozen generations after his own time.<br/>
He possessed strength worthy of an S-class adventurer while he was alive, but since he had not registered at the Adventurers’ Guild, his name was not left in the Guild’s records.<br/>
However, some Mages’ Guilds have records of him as one of the rare examples of a Dhampir who died of old age.<br/>
He is currently serving as the main instructor for Darcia’s training, but his inner thoughts are complex… I am training a mother who may become a god in the future, whose son might become a being as powerful as the great gods themselves… This might become difficult in the distant future.<br/>
Incidentally, he likes rice.<br/>
<br/>
Oniwaka – Kijin, 15 years old, female<br/>
The only daughter of the Kijin nation’s King Tenma and Queen Yura. She has a masculine face and a thin body, but she likes wearing the armor of a warrior, so she looks like a boy at first glance. The way she speaks is also similar to the way a man would speak, so one would assume she is male when talking to her.<br/>
In terms of social position, she stands on even ground with the Six Horn Battle-Demons, but she is inexperienced, something that she is conscious about. Oniwaka is her childhood name, not her real name.<br/>
She has a strong obsession with muscles; she wishes to one day acquire a body covered in steel-like muscles like that of the Majin king Godwin. At first, she challenged and fought Vandalieu, but they later hit it off and became good friends.<br/>
During the battle, Vandalieu extended a tongue and placed it on her cheek, so in a way, it could be considered a kiss… or perhaps not?<br/>
<br/>
Vida – The goddess of life and love<br/>
One of the eleven great gods who created Lambda. She rules over the life attribute, harvests, the struggle for existence, development and love in all forms. As the sun is a blessing that nurtures life, it is also one of her symbols.<br/>
Her holy symbol is a heart.<br/>
She was originally a goddess who possessed power equal to Alda’s, but she was defeated by Alda’s forces a hundred thousand years ago. Although she is not considered evil in human society, she is regarded as a goddess who committed a grave sin. As a result, she has few followers.<br/>
After she was deeply wounded by the champion Bellwood, Alda wielded his divine authority as a god who punishes other gods, inflicting even more severe damage.<br/>
As a result, she was almost completely unable to move until Vandalieu visited Vida’s Resting Grounds.<br/>
Now that she is able to move, she has done many things, such as promoting Veld and her other demi-heroic spirits to heroic spirits and welcoming Darcia to her Divine Realm to undergo training.<br/>
Her personality is that of a “friendly onee-san,” matching the personality that one might imagine from her teachings. If Alda is a god who strictly judges his followers, Vida is a goddess who watches over hers. Although she imposes harsh battles on them from time to time, she gives them her blessings whether they overcome them or not.<br/>
She gives her blessings to Vandalieu, not viewing his actions as problematic.<br/>
<br/>
Zuruwarn – The god of space and creation<br/>
The god who negotiated with the gods of earth and stopped the negotiations after reaching an agreement with only the dark gods. His tension as a god disappeared after he delivered the divine blessing to Vandalieu.<br/>
The people of Talosheim and the Boundary Mountain Range have begun worshiping him, but it seems that his power has not fully returned yet.<br/>
He has some interest in Gufadgarn, the evil god of labyrinths, as another space-attribute god. However, he realizes that it is unlikely that Gufadgarn will become his subordinate god and has given up on this idea.<br/>
Recently, he has been enjoying the food offered to him while monitoring Alda’s forces.<br/>
<br/>
Thomas Palpapek – Human, 40 years old, male<br/>
The marshal of the Mirg shield-nation, one of the vassal nations of the Amid Empire. At the same time, he made deals with Pure-breed Vampires who worshiped an evil god, plotting for his nation to become independent. He was one of the masterminds behind the incident in which Darcia was killed.<br/>
He was a competent individual; after his nation’s military power fell drastically following the failure of the expedition to Talosheim, he worked hard for its restoration and succeeded to some extent.<br/>
However, his actions incurred Vandalieu’s wrath. He was aware of this, aware that Vandalieu would one day come to kill him and his work was doing nothing more than creating more materials to be turned into Undead. Mentally, he was driven into a corner.<br/>
His ray of hope was when he made contact with Dalton of the Storm of Tyranny and requested for protection. Naturally, he was betrayed and then eaten alive by Pete and Vandalieu’s other insects.<br/>
<br/>
Heinz – Human, 27 years old, male<br/>
An S-class adventurer who leads the Five-colored Blades, who are active in the Orbaume Kingdom. He is a great hero whom Alda has expectations of, and a candidate for Bellwood’s successor.<br/>
Vandalieu acknowledges and fears him as the greatest threat to his own happiness.<br/>
Heinz has achieved many things, such as the sealing of the Demon King’s nose. He wished to try and re-challenge the Trial of Zakkart, from which he retreated from once in the past. However, it was conquered by Vandalieu before he could do so.<br/>
But a Dungeon created by Alda appeared before his very eyes, so he and his companions are now inside it.<br/>
His objective is to achieve things that even the radical faction of Alda, who harshly persecute Vida’s races, are forced to acknowledge. He aims to make Alda’s peaceful faction the mainstream branch of the religion of Alda. And if he is able to become Bellwood’s successor, he wishes to have an audience with the gods and ask Alda whether it is right to continue persecuting Vida’s races, and if it is, why he has been given a divine protection.<br/>
Now, he understands that there are some virtuous individuals among Vampires, and that there is no reason to execute Dhampirs and their Vampire parents. Extending this to all of Vida’s races, he believes that they should be acknowledged as people so that they and humans can come to a mutual understanding.<br/>
However, he has not realized that Ghouls, who are treated by human society as monsters, are actually a race created by Vida as well. He also mistakenly believes that Majin (and Kijin) are superior races of Demons. He is not even aware of the Empusa race’s existence.<br/>
Of course, he defeats all Undead he encounters, believing that they are beings that must return to the circle of transmigration. He believes that it is impossible to even co-exist with them, let alone reason with them, and that it should not even be attempted. Making use of the fragments of the Demon King is out of the question.<br/>
He is able to summon a heroic spirit into his own body with his newly awakened Heroic Spirit Descent Skill, further increasing his incredible ability in combat. He has also acquired the ‘Evil Suppression’ Unique Skill, which increases his attack power against Undead, the followers of evil gods, those with the divine protection of such evil gods and those who possess a fragment of the Demon King.<br/>
