Chapter 256: Superiority Complex<br/>
After that, I got busy.<br/>
I had to treat the new Demi-Human slaves from that facility, and there are too many things that need to be done in the village.<br/>
I also have to offer compensation for the damages to the merchants in the neighboring town.<br/>
Apparently, the Accessory merchant helped quiet everybody down.<br/>
He argued that the tax was ridiculously low, and that The Hero of the Shield was treated as a devil in this country, so such events were to be expected.<br/>
It seems he thinks that there are great profits to be made here.<br/>
The main reason for this is the expansive trade network built on my Filo Rials’ fast legs.<br/>
We agreed to carry his goods, so his profits rose.<br/>
Whenever Motoyasu gets his hands on some money, he goes off to buy and raise Filo Rials. We have no scarcity in that department.<br/>
And the repairs to the damaged buildings are proceeding at a good pace.<br/>
Even in such a time period, I cook every day, and spar with Atlas. It’s getting really hectic.<br/>
And three days after I returned to the village.<br/>
Me and Atlas learned the technique Rishia used for sucking in Chi from the air.<br/>
"It’s quite difficult." (Naofumi)<br/>
"Yes… Musou Kassei, was it? It seems that I’ll be able to keep it up for quite a while." (Atlas)<br/>
Yes, Atlas learned how to hold up Mussou Kassei for long periods of time.<br/>
But even though I learned how to suck in Chi, I can’t seem to get a grasp of Mussou Kassei whatsoever.<br/>
"Master, are you doing it again? Let Firo join." (Firo)<br/>
When Firo tried to copy our actions, she immediately grasped how to do it.<br/>
It seems that Genius type characters like to gather in my village.<br/>
Even though Firo had experience using the pose to recover magic, in just a day of practice, she learned to suck in Chi and move around.<br/>
For her to be able to obtain power so easily… how convenient.<br/>
What’s more, it seems that Firo subconsciously activated Musou Kassei. Her movements are quicker than before.<br/>
Just how strong are these people getting?<br/>
Firo can’t use pressure points, or Hengen Musou, but she can use her natural overflowing power to subjugate her enemies.<br/>
"Fuee… Naofumi-san and the others learned to use it without an instructor?" (Rishia)<br/>
"Yeah." (Naofumi)<br/>
Rishia happens to pass by in the middle of looking after Itsuki.<br/>
"I tried so hard to learn it, and yet… This can’t be…" (Rishia)<br/>
From Rishia’s point of View, Atlas and Firo are absolute geniuses.<br/>
But that Granny said Rishia was the one with outstanding talent. From watching her fight with Itsuki, I’m pretty sure she’s a genius in her own right.<br/>
I get the feeling that the Musou Kassei that Firo and Atlas picked up is somehow different from the one Rishia used.<br/>
They only learned through observation. There’s no way it’s as effective.<br/>
Even so, Rishia says their skill is not inferior.<br/>
Still, it somehow gives off a different feeling…<br/>
Ah, right. Just as I can’t grasp Musou Kassei, Rishia somehow became unable to use it.<br/>
Even so, she fights without problem. For some reason, she seems even stronger than before.<br/>
Perhaps Heroes just can’t use it.<br/>
"Then the two that learned to use it should proceed with caution, you know." (Rishia)<br/>
"Why is that?" (Atlas)<br/>
"Why~?" (Firo)<br/>
"It’s best not to keep Musou Kassei on for a long period of time. Your body won’t hold up." (Rishia)<br/>
Ah, so it’s that sort of boost skill.<br/>
In Manga and Anime, quite a few secret skills put large burdens on the body, and make it so that you can’t fight again after you use them.<br/>
But when the main character faces an extreme dire situation, he uses it and loses his ability to fight. He either miraculously recovers, or awakens to some other power.<br/>
But it’s not as if the world is that convenient for us.<br/>
It’s likely that Rishia’s ability to take in Chi is on another level.<br/>
The amount of Chi she had from the beginning didn’t get that high even when she raised her level. That’s the only reason I can think of.<br/>
And no matter how long Firo and Atlas can keep Mussou Kassei up, there’s still a limit.<br/>
Using only internal Chi, it’s one minute. While taking Chi in, five.<br/>
But Rishia was able to use it throughout her battle.<br/>
"That’s correct. There are times when you can hear grinding sounds from your bones. When you see opportune moments, you should activate it right before you attack." (Rishia)<br/>
"Right." (Naofumi)<br/>
Female Knight’s Musou Kassei wasn’t very effective, and had a short active period. These aspects aren’t really that important.<br/>
Fumu… Even though we just copied what we saw, it’s surprisingly complicated.<br/>
"It’s around time for food." (Naofumi)<br/>
I put my training on hold, and go to the dining hall to prepare food.<br/>
And I prepared it with the slaves I left the initial set up to.<br/>
We already set up a Bioplant to take care of the poisoned well and river.<br/>
The Three Hero Church didn’t leave anything positive behind in their legacy.<br/>
They were executed yesterday.<br/>
The head sister was sent to Faubley to become food for the pig. The rest were sentenced to the Iron Maiden.<br/>
In order to keep up the image, I had to go out in front of the public, and pretend to be one of the executioners.<br/>
Perhaps because I was raised in modern Japan, seeing a public execution was not good for my heart.<br/>
I had nightmares that night.<br/>
As the populace suffered quite a bit of damage, they booed and jeered at the convicts right through their deaths.<br/>
I’ve read in a book that such executions were held in the Middle Ages in my world in order to help the public vent stress.<br/>
Though I don’t know if that’s true.<br/>
Is it some instinctual stress reliever?<br/>
Like the feeling you get when you watch a public bonfire?<br/>
Why are they using a torture device like the iron maiden for an execution, anyways?<br/>
The victims’ screams echoed throughout the town. It was traumatizing.<br/>
And Armor, along with all of Itsuki’s other companions that I haven’t seen since Cal Mira, were executed as well.<br/>
Ironically, they were burned inside the Brass Bull.<br/>
In my world I think it was called the Phalaris Bull.<br/>
It’s one of Itsuki’s curse skill.<br/>
Even though Armor had been informed beforehand that he was set to die, when the time came, he trembled and begged for his life. His legs gave way below him.<br/>
Dreadful screams came from the bull statue.<br/>
Yeah, this is quite a cruel world.<br/>
I do think that some criminals deserve death, but when I actually encounter such scenarios, my head starts spinning.<br/>
It wasn’t refreshing in the least.<br/>
If I were to kill them by my own hand… would I feel any better?<br/>
Now that I think about it, I killed the pope with Blutopfer…<br/>
Back then, I didn’t feel refreshed at all. The only thing I could think about was the pain coursing through my body.<br/>
Yep, I don’t understand it.<br/>
At this point, I shouldn’t be bothered by killing, but watching people die in such gruesome ways makes me sick.<br/>
Uu… After remembering what happened yesterday, I have become disinclined to cook meat dishes.<br/>
I had my nose filled with the smell of Itsuki’s comrades burning, and I want to avoid blood for a bit.<br/>
"Niichan! Food!" (Kiel)<br/>
A loinclothed dog excitedly runs up to me, begging for food.<br/>
"Okay." (Naofumi)<br/>
I take out an item I had prepared. A crepe covered in dirt. I place the plate on the ground by the dog’s feet.<br/>
Everyone is at a loss for words as they stare at me.<br/>
What’s so surprising? I’m a man who keeps his promises.<br/>
Even if she was being brainwashed, I have to give some sort of punishment to the one who spoke so ill of me. (TL: Refer to the last lines of Chapter 230)<br/>
She should be thankful that her punishment ends with just this.<br/>
Anyways, for today, Kiel is the only one that gets a rundown crepe.<br/>
"I won’t let you say you forgot about it. That’s your meal for today." (Naofumi)<br/>
By the way, I made the meal a little bit more extravagant for everyone else.<br/>
With this, she should reflect on getting brainwashed by the enemy so easily.<br/>
Though I’ll probably end up giving her food anyways.<br/>
"Thank you, Niichan!" (Kiel)<br/>
"Wha-?" (Naofumi)<br/>
Kiel begins devouring the crepe like a dog.<br/>
The other slaves stare at her with their mouths wide open.<br/>
"Hehe." (Kiel)<br/>
With eyes brimming with a sense of superiority, the loinclothed dog looks over the other slaves in the dining hall.<br/>
The slaves swallow their spit as they stare at the plate she licked clean.<br/>
Taniko and Ren, who were eating together, are silent as well.<br/>
"W-what? How should I say this, it seems that only Kiel got the best food. And it looks like he made it especially for her." (Slave)<br/>
"Yeah" (Slave)<br/>
"Shield oniichan, please give me a crepe too." (Slave)<br/>
"Me too!" (Slave)<br/>
"Gimme!" (Slave)<br/>
"That’s not why I made it!" (Naofumi)<br/>
It’s lecture time!<br/>
Why does it seem like I’m giving that loinclothed dog special treatment!?<br/>
These people… They’re way too optimistic!<br/>
