Act 1 – Prologue<br/>
It was night. The stars twinkled merrily in the sky. Some falling stars shone brightly as they traveled through the night canopy. One person stood in the dark, fully wrapped in a jet-black plate mail. Black flames gushed out of his body.<br/>
He was the Dark Knight.<br/>
The black flames spread around creating a dark area. It looked as if there was a hole in the sky. The falling stars headed straight toward the darkness as if sucked by it.<br/>
Truthfully, those weren’t falling stars. They were angels with shining wings.<br/>
Angels were beings created by Gods of Light. Their counterpart was the Dark Knight who served the Demon King.<br/>
Clad in their shining white armor, the angels raised their swords and challenged the Dark Knight. The sky bore witness to a battle between Light and Darkness.<br/>
==<br/>
「NO WAY! THERE’S BUT A SINGLE ENEMY AND YET, OUR ENTIRE HOLY KNIGHT CAN’T EVEN BRING HIM DOWN! 」<br/>
An angel with a flaming sword shouted in outrage. Half of his comrades had been knocked down by a single Dark Knight. There were only a handful of angels left.<br/>
Some time had passed since the angels discovered the Dark Knight. As soon as they heard the news of a Dark Knight desecrating a temple of the Goddess in the surface world, they rallied their forces as quickly as they could.<br/>
However, they weren’t fast enough. Once they arrived at the temple, they discovered the Dark Knight had already left. They gave chase and the situation eventually escalated into a fight.<br/>
Truthfully, it would’ve been strange if things hadn’t escalated. The angel with the flaming sword recalled how the angel battalion lost so many soldiers.<br/>
As they attacked the angels fell, one after another, under the might of the Dark Knight. The way he attacked was as if he was merely killing some annoying pests.<br/>
It couldn’t even be called a fight.<br/>
No fighting spirit could be sensed from the Dark Knight. He probably didn’t even regard the Holy Knights as enemies.<br/>
The man in question shook his head at the angels, exasperated.<br/>
「Didn’t I tell you before to get the hell out of my way? 」<br/>
His voice was so low that anyone would miss it if they didn’t strain their ears to listen.<br/>
「IN YOUR DREAMS! AS IF WE CAN FORGIVE AN EVIL BEING LIKE YOU, BASTARD WHO RAIDED THE TEMPLE OF THE GODDESS! EVERYONE! KIIIIILL!」<br/>
The Dark Knight in front of them was the one who<br/>
committed the great sin of raiding the Temple of The Beautiful Goddess of Light, Alrena.<br/>
They had no intention to forgive the Dark Knight.<br/>
「Evil being… I see. It can’t be helped then, come as you may.」<br/>
As he said so, the Dark Knight raised his hand.<br/>
A big sword appeared out of thin air and he grabbed it tightly. Carved on the black body of that sword were blood-red lines, the pattern resembling blood vessels. Those lines pulsed crimson, giving the sword an ominous feeling.<br/>
It took only one swing of that fearsome black sword for the angels to be hit by a shockwave, rendering them completely immobile.<br/>
「Such power…」<br/>
The angels muttered in shock.<br/>
Until a while ago, the Dark Knight hadn’t even used a sword. After pulling it out, the difference in power was so great that they realized he hadn’t been fighting seriously before.<br/>
They couldn’t hide their shock at that discovery.<br/>
「DO NOT FALTER! EVERYONE, CHARGEEEEEEEEEEEEE! 」<br/>
With their courage boosted by that command, the angels spread their wings and resumed attacking the Dark Knight. Their wings shone brightly against the night sky, just like falling stars.<br/>
Even more powerful black flames gushed out of the Dark Knight’s body, rushing to repel the angels. The black flames spread through the area, making it look like darkness was painting over a meteor shower.<br/>
The angels approached the darkness and, as soon as they got close enough, the darkness swallowed them, shining wings and all…<br/>
… Only to violently spit them back out.<br/>
Every single one of the angels fell to the earth. Their glow created a trail in the sky, resembling a proper meteor shower.<br/>
The angel with the flaming sword stared at the skies as he fell with his brethren.<br/>
「You… Monster…」<br/>
Hovering calmly under the starry night sky was the figure of the Dark Knight.<br/>
<br/>
