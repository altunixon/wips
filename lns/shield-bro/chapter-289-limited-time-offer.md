<br/>
Limited Time Offer<br/>
With this and that, we returned to the village and began the days of improving our levels until the waves came.<br/>
Within that time, I went on an expedition with the high-leveled Raphtalia and the other slaves.<br/>
Ah~… Speaking of which, it’s about the events of the night we returned to the village.<br/>
I tried my daily work of compounding with the mortar.<br/>
 "Huh?" (Naofumi)<br/>
After a moment of grinding, the herbs became a blackened waste and gave off a foul stench.<br/>
It’s not at a level I should fail.<br/>
The more I grind, the more the waste increased.<br/>
I was only infusing the herbs so I’m puzzled about why they would change into charcoal.<br/>
"Naofumi-sama. Is something wrong?" (Raphtalia)<br/>
"My compounding is…" (Naofumi)<br/>
When I try compounding something else, it always fails.<br/>
….It seems like I’ve become unable to compound because of the curse’s influence.<br/>
This is like Ren’s Item Creation system being destroyed.<br/>
I take a break from working, and go to bed early that day.<br/>
Ah, for the Atla issue, I have slaves deployed near the house and have made a perfect defense so she can’t come.<br/>
Well, Fohl is locking her in unsparingly so it should be fine.<br/>
In addition to that… the so-called Raph species are keeping a watchful eye in the village.<br/>
Raphtalia begins swinging her sword outside for the sake of nighttime training.<br/>
"Rafu~" (Raph)<br/>
The tanuki-looking, raccoon-looking monsters known as the Raph came inside the room without anyone noticing.<br/>
Come to think of it, they also can use the same illusion magic as Raphtalia.<br/>
It’s quite convenient.<br/>
And yet, they came in a large group.<br/>
"Oh? I think you were the first generation Raph species, right?" (Naofumi)<br/>
Their appearance is relatively cute.<br/>
It seems there are generations of various types but that part was pretty ambiguous so I didn’t really understand it.<br/>
"Rafu~" (Raph)<br/>
The Raph extends its paw forward and strikes the ground seven times with a digit.<br/>
They’re the seventh generation Raph species? Or I should say, they’ve got a modest attitude.<br/>
They seem to understand human language in some respects and are greatly different from those noisy birds.<br/>
In terms of liking or disliking them, I think it would be more on the liking side.<br/>
The Raphs who entered the room were small and they cry out while approaching me.<br/>
"Ra-Raphtalia-san. E-everyone of the Raph species! Onii-sama, I just want to go where Naofumi-sama is! Please move aside." (Atla)<br/>
"You cannot." (Raphtalia)<br/>
"You can’t." (Fohl)<br/>
"""Rafu~!""" (Raphs)<br/>
…For some reason it’s noisy outside.<br/>
While they’re talking I casually stroke the Raphs.<br/>
Their feel isn’t bad.<br/>
Apparently I made this when I was crazy but…unexpectedly, I did a good job with them.<br/>
Hm? There are some shed hair.<br/>
….What will happen if I insert them into the shield?<br/>
I insert some as a test.<br/>
You have unlocked the requirements for the Raph Shield!<br/>
You have unlocked the requirements for the Tali Shield!<br/>
You have unlocked the requirements for the Lia Shield!<br/>
You have unlocked the requirements for the Original Raph Shield!<br/>
You have unlocked the requirements for the Battle Raph Shield!<br/>
….etc<br/>
To have a shield from a creature of a new species, what is this.<br/>
Well, if I think about it, there’s also evolution on top of the monsters currently existing, so it’s not strange that the entries continue to increase.<br/>
…I investigate the Raph Shield.<br/>
Raph Shield    0/20    C<br/>
Ability Sealed….Equipment Bonus, Raph Species Growth Correction (Small)    Raph Species Attack Designation 1    (Limited Time Offer) Raphtalia’s Ability Correction (Small)<br/>
Proficiency 0<br/>
…..err.<br/>
I don’t know which I should comment about.<br/>
What is that Limited Time Offer thing?<br/>
Is that like raising an ability with their individual limits or something, what kind of ability is it.<br/>
Well, Raphtalia is the one I trust the most so I won’t be dissatisfied if she gets stronger.<br/>
Or rather.<br/>
"Rafu~" (Raph)<br/>
Is it just my imagination? I feel like this releasing method and pattern vaguely resembles the Filorial System.<br/>
The Shield Tree also unlocks with a similar feeling.<br/>
"Rafu~?" (Raph)<br/>
"Is this a kid or an adult? I think there was a large one, right? How about you?" (Naofumi)<br/>
That Mii-kun fellow, how should I put it, he’s like a neighbourhood sprite from the countryside, and I feel like trying to nap on his stomach once. [T/N: My neighbour Rafufu (Rarafu?)]<br/>
That fellow doesn’t want to approach himself so he won’t want to, but an unfamiliar Raph might be fine.<br/>
Ah, that kid is a female. It seems there are male specimen<br/>
Those were originally of a different kind of monster though.<br/>
"Rafu~!" (Raph)<br/>
With a *poof* sound, the Raph I was hugging became slightly bigger<br/>
It’s just the right size for a body pillow.<br/>
And then I unreservedly throw myself onto its stomach and lie down.<br/>
…I want to try touching it a little.<br/>
While I stroke it, I lie face up as if it was a pillow.<br/>
Somehow it smells like Raphtalia.<br/>
Ah~… somehow I feel a strange sense of security.<br/>
Even afterwards, I raised them with a lot of physical contact and they’ve become considerably attached to me as a response.<br/>
They’re pretty cute.<br/>
They’re like the ideal pet I’ve always wanted.<br/>
"Rafu~" (Raph)<br/>
"Naofumi-sama! It’s almost time for…." (Raphtalia)<br/>
The door of the room opens and Raphtalia enters.<br/>
"…What..are you doing?" (Raphtalia)<br/>
"Hm? It kind of came to play so I’m just keeping it company though?" (Naofumi)<br/>
"Fake~!" (Raph)<br/>
"Be quiet!" (Raphtalia)<br/>
Somehow Raphtalia’s tail swells up, wary of the Raph.<br/>
"Ah…" (Naofumi)<br/>
Raphtalia seized the Raph by the nape of its neck and drove them out of the room.<br/>
I unconsciously reached out with my hand, reluctant to part.<br/>
That sensation when I was stroking it…. even though it was fine.<br/>
I thought it would have made a perfect body pillow.<br/>
"Naofumi-sama, please don’t play with the Raph species so much." (Raphtalia) [T/N: Somebody’s jealous~]<br/>
"Is that so? I’ve always wanted this kind of pet though. To be honest, it’s my type of monster." (Naofumi)<br/>
"It’s a promise with me!" (Raphtalia)<br/>
"Why do you hate it so much?" (Naofumi)<br/>
Well, it’s not like I don’t understand.<br/>
It’s probably like an Otaku giving their girlfriend a model figure they made as a present.<br/>
Moreover, to be freely caressing it in front of their eyes.<br/>
If I think about it properly, am I a hentai otaku!?<br/>
No, she’s not a girlfriend. Instead, she feels more like a daughter.<br/>
I doubt people sleep on their daughter’s stomaches though.<br/>
Well, when I check their status afterwards, they’re pretty exceptional.<br/>
I saw that their levels were low, but their potential was quite high.<br/>
I think it might be equal to the Filorials’.<br/>
The subspecies are also quite diverse.<br/>
There’s a specimen that can pull carriages like the Filorials too.<br/>
Those were originally Caterpillands though.<br/>
Looking at their integration, I’ll have them take on a role in combat or peddling.<br/>
Yeah, like they said, the guys in the monster hut originally wished for the modification.<br/>
"Umm… how should I say it, it’s embarrassing to watch." (Raphtalia)<br/>
"So it’s that kind of thing." (Naofumi)<br/>
I understand her feelings.<br/>
Even I would dislike it if a clone of me was made and was caressed by Raphtalia.<br/>
By the way, the ability that was in the shield before, the Attack Designation 1 allows me to direct the Raphs to focus their attacks on the monster I indicate.<br/>
Also, a variety of other instructions appeared.<br/>
Furthermore, there’s even a strange skill like ‘C’mon Raphs’…. the things this shield has.<br/>
When used, I can summon the Raphs by portal.<br/>
….Somehow Raphtalia makes a complicated face whenever I use it so I’m worried about whether I should seal its use.<br/>
Incidentally, the Raphs that turned wild extended their influence and now they’ve created an ecosystem in my territory, but that’s another story.<br/>
The next day.<br/>
"Now then, Naofumi-sama. Please scold Atla-chan, Firo and Kiel-kun and punish each of them." (Raphtalia)<br/>
Atla, Firo and Kiel were kept in the village plaza and I was told to scold them by Raphtalia.<br/>
In reality, I was the one who went crazy and they were just taking my side so I think the fault should be mine.<br/>
I feel like I’m in no position to assign punishments…….<br/>
Or rather, I should be the one receiving a punishment instead.<br/>
It didn’t become a big deal thanks to Melty making the necessary arrangements, but I caused quite a loss.<br/>
It seems I came to harass the village and town occasionally and caused some destruction.<br/>
Apparently it was covered for by using the profits from the Reconstruction Festival though.<br/>
I heard that I also assaulted the merchants in my territory.<br/>
According to Firo, I didn’t have enough materials and so Firo raided those possessing what I needed from the sky or something.<br/>
Well, they were recompensated, and they were told not to approach the location beforehand so the merchants who did approach were at fault.<br/>
Furthermore, Melty collected all the evidence in the area so there shouldn’t be any false reports.<br/>
Honestly, I want to be forgiven for this kind of incident.<br/>
That being the case, let’s obey Raphtalia’s instructions if anything happens next time.<br/>
To be frank, I feel guilty about Sadina’s brown colouring. The person herself doesn’t care and is just happily drinking alcohol though.<br/>
That her drinking ability has increased is comforting, but it’s my fault that it became such an outrageous situation and I do my own self-reflection.<br/>
If I am sternly cautioned by Raphtalia now ….but then those three won’t get the message.<br/>
"Atla." (Naofumi)<br/>
"What is it, Naofumi-sama?" (Atla)<br/>
"….Why did you join me?" (Naofumi)<br/>
She was asked before but I’ll ask her again.<br/>
"Because that person was still Naofumi-sama, and I will always be by Naofumi-sama’s side." (Atla)<br/>
"Firo too~" (Firo)<br/>
Firo spoke after Atla did.<br/>
"You know, Master. You had a really great smile." (Firo)<br/>
And then she cries with flowing tears….oh Jeez.<br/>
Just how attached was she.<br/>
Were you that pleased about being able to fly in the sky?<br/>
"That wasn’t me. It was something that possessed me." (Naofumi)<br/>
"Eh~ that’s wrong~" (Firo)<br/>
"That’s right." (Atla)<br/>
"Yeah! Nii-chan was nice!" (Kiel)<br/>
I was an arrogant villain! I wasn’t nice!<br/>
Or so I could respond but….it seems like I might step on a land mine so I’ll stay silent.<br/>
"Then…." (Naofumi)<br/>
For a punishment, I must assign something the person will hate so that they’ll reflect.<br/>
In Atla’s case, she might conversely be happy with whatever I order her to do.<br/>
Alright.<br/>
"Fohl." (Naofumi)<br/>
"…What?" (Fohl)<br/>
"To drive Atla away, you’ll be sleeping in my room." (Naofumi)<br/>
"Again!" (Fohl)<br/>
"The thing your Atla hates is?" (Naofumi)<br/>
"Ughh…Onii-sama, if you do that―" (Atla)<br/>
Atla emits a negative aura towards Fohl.<br/>
"I-I got it! Nii-chan, I’ll work hard in order to punish Atla." (Fohl)<br/>
"Raphtalia is also fine with that, right?" (Naofumi)<br/>
"Ah…yes… Fohl-kun. Please protect Naofumi-sama from the Raph species as well." (Raphtalia)<br/>
"I got it, Big Sis." (Fohl)<br/>
That Fohl, he now obediently obeys Raphtalia.<br/>
Damn. Raphtalia doesn’t need you!<br/>
Or rather, what the hell am I thinking.<br/>
"So next is Firo." (Naofumi)<br/>
How should I punish Firo?<br/>
It seems like going three days without food or something will be enough for her to reflect. I can probably use the Monster Crest to reinforce it as well.<br/>
The problem is… it’s dangerous because there’s the possibility that Firo may lose judgement from hunger and cause an outrageous incident though.<br/>
"Father-in-Law!" (Motoyasu)<br/>
Motoyasu starts addressing me.<br/>
He’ll probably talk about something indecent again.<br/>
Let’s ignore him.<br/>
"Ah, Naofumi-sama." (Raphtalia)<br/>
"What is it?" (Naofumi)<br/>
"The Hero of the Spear is…that is, he was very cooperative during this last incident. Please give him a reward somehow." (Raphtalia)<br/>
"Why so sudden?" (Naofumi)<br/>
"I promised him…." (Raphtalia)<br/>
Grr… speaking of which, I heard the whole story.<br/>
At first he was a subordinate of the crazy me but he was told by Melty that Raphtalia was someone related to Firo and so he recognised Raphtalia as a person and not a pig, and finally was persuaded to cooperate and such.<br/>
I hadn’t concealed my surprise at him being able to converse with a female other than Melty, but it’s related to Firo again.<br/>
So Melty is her fiance and Raphtalia is her older sister.<br/>
As I expected, all the women are pigs except for those with a relationship to Firo.<br/>
When I think about it, it’s an inevitable result.<br/>
Nevertheless, Firo’s punishment and Motoyasu’s reward, huh…..<br/>
Alright!<br/>
"Firo." (Naofumi)<br/>
"Wha~t?" (Firo)<br/>
"Go on a date with Motoyasu for the day. You must always stay within thirty metres of him." (Naofumi)<br/>
I activate the Monster Crest and made it so she would suffer if she violated it.<br/>
"No~!" (Firo)<br/>
"Really, Father-in-Law?!" (Motoyasu)<br/>
Motoyasu’s eyes shine!<br/>
Don’t bring your face so close, it’s disgusting.<br/>
"Yeah, however, I absolutely won’t forgive a relationship beyond that of dating, forcefully pressing her for a kiss, or trying to have sex and such." (Naofumi)<br/>
"Yes! Now then, Firo-tan. Let’s go on the date." (Motoyasu)<br/>
"Buuuuuuuuu!""" (Kuu, Midori & Marine)<br/>
Motoyasu’s three followers protest while releasing bloodlust.<br/>
I don’t care. If this much isn’t done then it won’t be a reward nor a punishment!<br/>
Motoyasu untied the rope Firo was bound with.<br/>
When he does, Firo struggles and starts flying in the sky.<br/>
"No~! Master, save me!" (Firo)<br/>
"Sorry. I’m not in a situation where I can defend you." (Naofumii)<br/>
I’m the one who gave the punishment though.<br/>
"NOOooo~!" (Firo)<br/>
Flapping her wings, Firo flew at quite a fast speed.<br/>
She barely stopped within thirty metres.<br/>
"Hahaha, is it a rendezvous in the sky? Firo-tan!" (Motoyasu)<br/>
Motoyasu ran and chased after her.<br/>
"Don’t come near~!!" (Firo)<br/>
Firo fled while flying.<br/>
Is that a date?<br/>
It’s fine since Motoyasu seems very delighted.<br/>
Yeah. With this, they won’t come back for a while.<br/>
"That female’s owner, what a reward! I definitely won’t forgive him!" (Kuu)<br/>
"Yeah! Unforgivable." (Marine)<br/>
"Let’s curse him." (Midori)<br/>
Those three are annoying.<br/>
In that case you guys should go claim Motoyasu yourselves.<br/>
By the way, apparently Firo and Motoyasu spent the day chasing one another.<br/>
Motoyasu reported back happily, but I could only wonder if that was enough.<br/>
