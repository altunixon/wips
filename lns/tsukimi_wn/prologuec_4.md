<br/>
Hey, we have arrived to the first POV chapter.<br/>
This POV chapters are like a compilation of the arcs and will be given in the POV of a related party.<br/>
It is an insight chapter and not a necessary one so feel free to read it if you want. ðŸ˜€<br/>
â€”â€”â€“<br/>
There was a goddess whose interactions had long since died out.<br/>
Itâ€™s only contact with a human was one month ago in human sense.<br/>
The world it was managing was causing troubles, at those times humans were always there.<br/>
"That is impossible" I didnâ€™t pay attention to it at first.<br/>
Thatâ€™s because everyone that lived in this world was special in some way.<br/>
Humans.<br/>
The living beings that stood at the summit was not an exaggeration.<br/>
Depending on the circumstances even Gods would be brought down by them.<br/>
Those guys were the ones who lived at the very beginning of the world in the original world, not even crying nor asking for the protection of a transparent God, they took their work onto their own hands. A strict world where its life was limited.<br/>
Humans were most likely not even aware of how harsh it was to live in this kind of environment. Looking at the outside of this world called Earth, they would think this was actually a miracle place they were brought into, some humans may even be thankful of God for being born in such a place.<br/>
In a kind of sense it was a mistaken opinion.<br/>
The Gods who know the other worlds also know that in that original world, the Earth was an incredibly harsh environment.<br/>
As their body abilities were remarkably over their limits, it was natural that the thing called magic power was thin in exchange.<br/>
Thatâ€™s why it was natural for humans to live for only 100 years or so and most of them were unable to utilize a single magical spell.<br/>
Thatâ€™s awful.<br/>
Just from being born in this world, not only were they stripped off from their right-arm(magic) it was also the same as saying that you wonâ€™t live long.<br/>
For a person from another world to live here, in human terms it would be like living on top of clouds or trying to live a normal live at the bottom of the sea.<br/>
Without being afflicted by such an environment, one of the reasons why the humans were evaluated as the summit was because they had the ability, they could develop it and make use of it.<br/>
Possibility.<br/>
The most supreme yet worst power.<br/>
Learning from the worlds concepts, creating science, humans have invented various tools that made the world a more comfortable place to live in.<br/>
Originally, in that world humans shouldnâ€™t have obtained science.<br/>
In this natural environment there werenâ€™t any living creatures that could have obtained it.<br/>
A world where the intervention of Gods was thin, wisdom was something that should have been incredibly hard to get.<br/>
But in the present world they have obtained such thing.<br/>
What was originally thought to be impossible to obtain was obtained by humans, ironically it was the severity of this world that made them obtain this ability.<br/>
In a place where Gods intervention was difficult, on top of it a world where spirits were not able to properly exist in.<br/>
The natureâ€™s phenomenon were practically all occurring by a principle.<br/>
Gods and Spirits, this beings that possessed incredible power, were unable to crook nor bend the truths and phenomenon.<br/>
Thatâ€™s right, if you had interest in it, anyone would be able to understand the logics in it.<br/>
At one time a human gave birth to fire, by using this logic they opened the door of what is called science.<br/>
Even between the Gods there were split opinions about the humans using the logic(principles), and with that as the trigger, multiple disputes burst out. It was the biggest fight that had happened between the Gods that managed this world.<br/>
Leaving aside how this fight concluded.<br/>
In the actual time, humans showed a frightful amount of possibilities to this world.<br/>
Right now it is fine but in time if they were to interfere in other worlds, the ones called Gods would have to face against them. That means humans will meet the deities in time by the hands of their technology.<br/>
At that time will humans be humans, or maybe they will be treated as semi-gods, even now some of the Gods are questioning this.<br/>
In this actual world, the humans who could even oppose the Gods, moreover obtain the thing called science. They had to prepare themselves as it was a grave situation.<br/>
This beings unique and abnormal nature was clear.<br/>
Thatâ€™s why, humans were basically living in this original world for eternity.<br/>
From other worlds Gods to creation Gods, they sought to invite humans but the ones who were able to do so were mostly none.<br/>
Because the effects that they would receive were too big.<br/>
They donâ€™t know what would happen to the world if they were to summon one human being.<br/>
To say the least, that worlds intended future would create considerable amounts of futures where there shouldnâ€™t have originally existed.<br/>
It could be said that they would walk into an area they wouldnâ€™t be able to predict.<br/>
Sometimes the possibility power, especially the weakest ones, would fall down from it. For other worlds to obtain it was a rare occurrence and overall only a few of them were able to do so.<br/>
In the places it has fallen, the God that is managing that world and the one managing the origin one, a number of problems would occur but as of now no big events have happened.<br/>
As a matter of course, I refused the request of the goddess.<br/>
Without a proper reason, and it wasnâ€™t like an incident has occurred or anything, to send a human to another world? Donâ€™t joke with me.<br/>
But.<br/>
That goddess told me something very interesting.<br/>
Then itâ€™s fine if its not human.<br/>
Thatâ€™s what she said.<br/>
When I asked her in detail, the world that the girl was managing there seemed to be a race called Hyuman.<br/>
It seemed to be a creation based on humans that the Goddess modified to be the appropriate existence.<br/>
When I check it out, it certainly was there.<br/>
On top of it, a modern styled or so to say "home ground" Japan.<br/>
The misleading name of Hyuman was aggravating but it was more like a different brand of the same kind of thing.<br/>
Their body abilities were comparably weaker to humans, instead of being those monsters of possibilities they were more on the lenient side.<br/>
And also compared to humans, this sides were inclined to have more girls, their magic power that was easy to use might be the effect of having their body tampered with.<br/>
In an easy to understand way, the goddess taste of girls made them easy to be born in, also it could be said that they were weak and low possibility humans.<br/>
For her it could be an improvement but, in the point of view for quality they were degraded.<br/>
Especially, what was she thinking by making the girls more prominent?<br/>
Was it because you are a woman god?<br/>
Nah, being a Goddess, creation was something habitual. This kind of regulation was something I havenâ€™t seen anyone doing.<br/>
She is doing something I donâ€™t understand.<br/>
Anyways, those hyumans were living in that kind of world.<br/>
Living in Japan, there they establish with their children, in the present time they are in good health.<br/>
It seems they were somewhat receiving the protection of their Goddess.<br/>
Itâ€™s quite the thing.<br/>
Though, the way the goddess does things is, how to say it? Amazing to say the least.<br/>
Instead of clever it was more like shrewd.<br/>
Instead of skillful it was more like crafty.<br/>
I was against the way this girl operated.<br/>
In the time she was managing various worlds, had a change occurred in her?<br/>
She was not the type of girl that interfered in this stuff.<br/>
Of course I also had opposition in those so called accidents.<br/>
In the same way that the origin world could spill out to another world.<br/>
Another world could possibly, even if few, be able to too.<br/>
But that is something that wouldnâ€™t bring that much interest in.<br/>
Why is that?<br/>
Because most of them would die.<br/>
They wouldnâ€™t be able to adapt to the origin world.<br/>
Even if some of them were to survive, the cases where they would affect the world were almost nonexistent.<br/>
The werewolfs, the yukionna, those famous examples, to the gigantic life forms that were suddenly discovered.<br/>
They would be able to cause uproars but in the end they were not beings that could create new possibilities.<br/>
Of course, in such rare occurrences where it happened, Gods would provide assistance to humans in order to cope with it.<br/>
Even if they are able to survive, they will mostly not cause any kind of trouble to humans. By receiving the protection of the Gods they would normally live in peace.<br/>
But well, regarding them there are agreements and issues, that was the reality of it.<br/>
The goddess seemed to be trying to use that as a pretext.<br/>
If in the origin world they could live by adapting to it, by the goddess summon, that person would do contributions worth seeing over.<br/>
"But they are people that are living in this world right? If they are summoned, it would mean that they would have to throw away all of that. Will you be able to provide conditions that can make it agree?"(<br/>
"You are always like this right? For a God to take the peoples circumstances in consideration, I think that is useless concern"<br/>
"I will tell you this, if you are to do it forcefully you will be declaring war against me. You havenâ€™t even obtained permission to do the transfer, so I will not create the gate"<br/>
"I understand. Itâ€™s not like I was saying I would do it forcefully. I have already discussed this with the Misumi (Tn: Not sure about names), as they were transported a long time ago. Thatâ€™s why there wonâ€™t be denial"<br/>
"Fumu, I see, they were already transported once. In that case the one who will be transported is one of the children, right?<br/>
There arenâ€™t many out there who held a body that can handle multiple transfers to other worlds.<br/>
Though if itâ€™s a human itâ€™s a different story.<br/>
"Yeah. All is fine if you just give me your cooperation and create the gate. I will not trouble you. I will handle the rest"<br/>
"Itâ€™s no good.Â  At best, to create a fitting gate I would have to wait until January. I will look over it, the moment the gate is created I will also be present with you"<br/>
"!!? Arenâ€™t you being really distrustful?"<br/>
"Of course. There is no change in the fact we will be transferring a living being from the origin world, moreover the words of someone who is trying to make me agree to a summon by using underhanded means, I wonâ€™t swallow them so easily"<br/>
"Is that the kind of words you should be saying to someone who will carve her name in the world of creation deities? Only having done plain jobs, you mere moon deity"<br/>
"Because you have the ability of creation you are great? I will return those words to you, it seems you have become quite conceited. Our works donâ€™t have such thing as ranks. Everything is necessary, everything we do is something that we should respect. You being a high class goddess should feel ashamed that someone else has to point it out to you"<br/>
"Who cares? I leave it to you to do the selection. Well see you in January"<br/>
Feeling that she would be preached, she closed the conversation and disappeared.<br/>
Yareyare.<br/>
I donâ€™t have that much free time though.<br/>
Remembering the conversation with her I breathe out a sigh.<br/>
Today is the day.<br/>
The suitable day to create the otherworld gate.<br/>
The other day I went to see the Misumi familyâ€™s kids that the goddess nominated.<br/>
Because we would have to choose one of them to transfer.<br/>
From oldest one it was a girl, boy and a girl.<br/>
There were 3 kids in the household of Misumi.<br/>
The oldest daughtersâ€™ endurance was low and her physical ability was normal, she only had experience in judo, but she was incredibly good at it.<br/>
From her body I could sense the power of a god.<br/>
It seems that thanks to the godâ€™s powers protection her physical abilities were at the minimum. Her ability in judo was the results of her training, itâ€™s a case where the talent bloomed.<br/>
Right now she was not aiming the official matchesâ€™ route. She was attending university and was aiming to be a physician.<br/>
Her relationship companion was a person with a favorable wind.<br/>
The body of the second daughter was slightly weak, she learned karate and again it seems she had talent in it.<br/>
I couldnâ€™t feel the godâ€™s power within her.<br/>
That even without it she was able to be born healthy must be because at that time her parentsâ€™ body had already adapted to this worldâ€™s environment.<br/>
As she was the youngest child, she was used to being loved. Her family and friends would normally pamper her.<br/>
Even with her high school test approaching and being pressed with studying for them, she was positively facing it.<br/>
Right now she has no partner, she was at that age where she would dream of those things.<br/>
And now the eldest son.<br/>
This is most likely the person that the goddess was referring to.<br/>
I donâ€™t know about the Goddess conversation with the parent or how she conversed with them.<br/>
But he was clearly different from the other two.<br/>
The eldest sister that was protected by the goddess power, the second daughter which her parents had adapted to the environment on time.<br/>
He had the appearance of someone who had come from another world and looked incredibly feeble.<br/>
To the point where it wouldnâ€™t be strange for him to have died a couple of times. To have surpassed the infancy period is already a miracle.<br/>
In other words, in a bad way, he was the one that inherited the special characteristics of his parents the most.<br/>
There is supposed to be a high probability of having a unique appearance, yet he had the average face of a Japanese person.<br/>
Though his physical ability was properly inherited as it was weak just like his parents.<br/>
He must not be aware of it but he is walking on an unfortunate life. (TN: Wow they are really dropping it with the MC)<br/>
From the information that the fate goddess has provided me easily made me raise my voice.<br/>
Eldest sister, second daughter and also his parents have a unique appearance that makes people around envy them but only he had a mediocre looks.<br/>
Looking at it from just scale it was actually a praiseworthy miracle though (TN: referring to how rare it is to get a non-special face), if you only see at the numbers he only had normal strength.<br/>
In a place where it wouldnâ€™t have been strange to have received talents, it was to the degree of apologizing that he was born a normal person that did not receive a single one of them.<br/>
Moreover since he was born in the peaceful Japan, the talent he had would not have a chance to awaken.<br/>
In a sense his disadvantage width was amazing.<br/>
As a result he has been living a very, very ordinary life as a Japanese high school boy.<br/>
That is in general a valid assessment.<br/>
Even if he struggles and struggles, he will still remain in that same position.<br/>
The configuration of siblings was similar to mine, so I felt a sort of connection with him.<br/>
The only similarity was that we were in between the top and bottom though.<br/>
And the only ability of Misumi Makoto.<br/>
Different from a talent, no, is it correct to call it a talent?<br/>
That is something Iâ€™m not sure myself.<br/>
The archery he had been learning since infancy.<br/>
It was his high ability in it.<br/>
Instead of a natural gift he was more like a prodigy.<br/>
Different from having been born with it, it was an ability that bloomed from a different place.<br/>
The ability to hit the target.<br/>
It seemed a little different though.<br/>
But in that short amount of time I have concluded that his ability is to hit targets.<br/>
With that unique concentration, he with his bow would never miss its target.<br/>
It was truly splendid, if in the future he were to use that ability in a fitted job there is a chance he would become a terrifying existence.<br/>
Even if that doesnâ€™t happen, he could dig deep inside his self with his concentration ability. In the future it would prove useful to him.<br/>
From the 3 kids of the Misumi family, he was the only one who had this kind of strange ability.<br/>
In short, he heard from his parents to use it on emergencies, or so it goes.<br/>
Thatâ€™s why even when having this ability he is aware of it.<br/>
If there is a candidate for transportation it should be him.<br/>
If I were able to have a conversation with him I could be able to understand the situation more but, for a God to interact with a human there a lot of strict regulations, in this times case it would be just at the moment of the transfer.<br/>
I felt that I would be able to get along with him, it is regretful.<br/>
But.<br/>
The other party will have anxiety remaining.<br/>
Misumi in this one month, he had been living as if nothing happened and leading a high school life.<br/>
He did not sort out his personal affairs, he hadnâ€™t even done any training concerning the transfer at all.<br/>
He was leading his life as every other day.<br/>
He would wake up, if it was his turn he would make the breakfast, he carried his bento to attend school, worked hard in club activities, studied, mingled with friends, took a meal, trained his body, delved himself in his hobbies, bathed, slept.<br/>
He was a young man in his teens after all.<br/>
He had decent tastes, there were a number of people that had taken a fancy to him in high school.<br/>
Anyone who Misumi asked, at least if talking about his appearance, they would tell him he is a lucky guy.<br/>
For him it would be the first time in this world he would experience spring. (TN: As in love blossoming)<br/>
The most prominent ones in my eyes are the club activities kohai (junior) and the clubâ€™s president.<br/>
If it becomes a triangle relationship, the ones who are watching from the sides would have a lot of fun.<br/>
For the boy who has not experienced a single relationship, there is no helping he is expecting something. Watching the love affair of the young ones brings a smile to my face.<br/>
Though.<br/>
That will not become reality.<br/>
Because I will be taking away everything from the time he has spent to the time he will be spending in this world.<br/>
To have your whole life derail by the selfishness of a God is indeed an unpleasant feeling.<br/>
He has the right to hate us.<br/>
Making time in my busy schedule, I had to take the role of the hated one, I am completely out of luck.<br/>
Well now, I should call him.<br/>
Dragging the Misumi inside his dreams, at the same time that I created the gate I also made a space where I invited him to.<br/>
â—‡â—†â—‡â—†â—‡â—†â—‡â—†<br/>
What a stupid thing have you done!!!<br/>
That goddess reckless actions. With a face of disbelief I look at Makoto that has disappeared from in front of me. I was feeling an indescribable anger I hadnâ€™t felt before.<br/>
While I was wondering why the creation of the transfer gate was taking so long, not only the appointed person but on top of that 2 other pure humans had also been taken away.<br/>
I wanted to talk with the person in respects to the transfer so I asked the details about it but, that boy didnâ€™t know anything at all.<br/>
Aside from the fact that he had not discussed to his parents about it, he still didnâ€™t know that he was a hyuman.<br/>
That was reasonable.<br/>
Even if he was to notice it when he was in the other world I wouldnâ€™t be able to be by his side. I pray that he makes a good friend.<br/>
Its birthplace and brought up environment, when humans begin to question those, the ones who will become their support will not be Gods.<br/>
The past he has walked upon, friends he can depend on, a figure one looks up to.<br/>
Itâ€™s those kind of things.<br/>
Subsequently, I regret to have made a statement that was like trying to cover for that goddess.<br/>
By habit I requested Makoto to turn a blind eye on the actions of the goddess.<br/>
Of course if his relation with her goes well that is desirable but, in the case that the boy follows recklessly, listening to what she said and turns out the result was different from expected.<br/>
With this kind of treatment he would be way too pitiful.<br/>
In this situation there was no other remedy.<br/>
I had lost a great amount power with him but I still used all of my willpower to send some to him into his vessel.<br/>
It was really hard to endure on this old body.<br/>
But thinking about that boy who chose to be transferred in place of his sisters, I couldnâ€™t say those kind of words.<br/>
With only my consciousness I will head over there and track down those 2 that had been taken away.<br/>
It took its time but it seems that the two of them had already come in contact with a hyuman settlement.<br/>
Both of them had numerous blessings from the goddess and were even granted sacred treasures.<br/>
It looks like those two have no problems.<br/>
Leaving aside the worlds influence, their eyes didnâ€™t seem to harbor any inconvenience.<br/>
Maybe itâ€™s because of the rules that state the transferred ones must agree with it. Those two, even if they were confused I didnâ€™t feel any feelings of rejection from them.<br/>
Now then, about Makoto.<br/>
I had heard that goddess ramblings to the point of rotting my ears but I wonder how much of what she said was serious.<br/>
W-What?!<br/>
Makoto was really in the sky?!<br/>
Aside from sacred treasures I can barely feel the power of the goddess within him!<br/>
I can feel it faintly butâ€¦ language understanding?<br/>
That not something you give to someone, and moreover it was thrust upon him in an incomplete state.<br/>
But to think he would be thrown away in this border without a single thing!<br/>
â—‡â—†â—‡â—†â—‡â—†â—‡â—†<br/>
To the ends of the world, star falling into wasteland, a body falls.<br/>
Haiku of my season.<br/>
NONONONONONO.<br/>
Why am I think about a haiku?!<br/>
With such an unrealistic occurrence I shortly escaped from reality.<br/>
By the calls of a God he was transferred to this world and suddenly he is in the sky head first!<br/>
That stupid girl, even if you are a god what are you doing!<br/>
I will contact Makoto as soon as possible.<br/>
From the boy that had a face like he had given up on life while falling, a bit of vitality had appeared in it.<br/>
On top of telling him that he wouldnâ€™t die even if he fell, I told him that two persons had also been transferred along with him.<br/>
As expected, Makoto asked worried if one of her sisters was in those two that were transferred. I told him that wasnâ€™t the case.<br/>
Telling him that the two of them had already come into contact with people, a complex expression appeared on Makotoâ€™s face.<br/>
Even so, when I tried requested him to treat them well if he were to meet them, he showed me a face of amazement and with a kind expression he nodded.<br/>
Fufufu.<br/>
As I thought, I do get well with him.<br/>
Finally, I felt like my power was drying up.<br/>
The time limit is close.<br/>
I wanted to talk with him about a lot more things but it seems that wonâ€™t be possible.<br/>
That goddess, I hope she is prepared to be punished.<br/>
Even if she is a creation deity of lots of authority, I wonâ€™t let it finish without repercussion.<br/>
"This kind of situation. Originally, the role of the hero that was supposed to be yours was taken away by the goddess itself so, you donâ€™t have to hold back. By the name of Tsukuyomi I permit it. You, Misumi Makoto. I give you freedom in this new world. Do what you want!"<br/>
Makoto doesnâ€™t need to hear the goddess, and with just my word he would feel uneasy but with my name on line I promised him freedom.<br/>
The Makoto who seemed to be happy at my words.<br/>
Thatâ€™s right, with this kind of poor treatment, who would follow anything that goddess says.<br/>
In any way you want, for the rest of your life, it is okay to live it as you want!<br/>
"With the will of the spirits, I pray that we will meet again. At that time I hope you will tell me about your way of living in this world. Please, let Makoto have good fortune in the future that is to come"<br/>
It is already impossible for us to meet in this world anymore. With a prayer that we will meet again, I disappeared from the world of the goddess.<br/>
My consciousness turned muddy.<br/>
To have used this much power is a first for me.<br/>
It was the worst feeling, terrible, is what I thought.<br/>
Overexerting myself I was barely able to request the assistance of a number of acquaintances. Finally, I collapsed.<br/>
Please, let Makoto have a blissful future.<br/>
