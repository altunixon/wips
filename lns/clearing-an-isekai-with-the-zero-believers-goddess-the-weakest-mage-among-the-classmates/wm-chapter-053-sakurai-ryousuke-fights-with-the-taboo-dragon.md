<br/>
-Sakurai Ryousuke POV-<br/>
Incredible! He really dragged the Taboo Dragons outside.<br/>
They hid deep inside the dungeon, and were problematic monsters that we didn’t know how to subjugate.<br/>
And yet, Takatsuki-kun managed to throw them high into the sky along with him using his magic.<br/>
I suddenly remember…<br/>
(Oh no, Takatsuki-kun can’t use flying magic!) (Sakurai)<br/>
I hurriedly looked at Takatsuki-kun, but he had some sort of small umbrella-like item, and was slowly falling.<br/>
What a relief, it looks like he had a magic item.<br/>
He raised his right hand and gave me a sign that felt like it said ‘I leave the rest to you’.<br/>
(Alright! It is my job from here on!) (Sakurai)<br/>
I take a stance with my holy sword, and concentrate the holy aura.<br/>
Light Hero Skill: [Golden Holy Aura].<br/>
I bring that into my sword.<br/>
There’s 2 Taboo Dragons.<br/>
The water dragon magic of Takatsuki-kun has disappeared, and they are now freed, showing their abominable appearance.<br/>
(I will be pushing my full power without holding anything back!) (Sakurai)<br/>
I held my sword in both hands, and swung.<br/>
[Light Sword: Shining Saber]! <br/>
The light that was shot from the sword cuts the enemy in a cross shape.<br/>
One of the Taboo Dragons explodes.<br/>
(Alright!) (Sakurai)<br/>
Seeing this, the other Taboo Dragon must have noticed that it was no match, it began to run away.<br/>
As if I will let you!<br/>
(That’s the direction of the city!) (Sakurai)<br/>
Oh no.<br/>
I hurriedly chase it, but that thing is slightly faster than me.<br/>
The city is falling into panic at the disturbing Taboo Dragon that suddenly appeared and they have never seen before.<br/>
The Taboo Dragon is planning on blowing its breath attack?! <br/>
This is bad! The breath attack of a Taboo Dragon isn’t just an attack method, but also has the effect of spreading curses.<br/>
The Labyrinth City will become a cursed city where people can’t live in!<br/>
But if I were to attack with my full power, I will drag the city into it.<br/>
(What should I do…?) (Sakurai)<br/>
I glanced at Takatsuki-kun, and he was looking at me with a face of: ‘Oi oi, what are you doing?’.<br/>
He raised both hands and made a pose of: ‘I got nothing’. <br/>
Right…he did so much already.<br/>
I can’t rely on him anymore.<br/>
I was about to shoot the Light Sword with the resolve of hitting the city as well…<br/>
*Shiiing!*<br/>
The Taboo Dragon crashes into a transparent wall and makes a strange sound.<br/>
The Taboo Dragon is confused.<br/>
(…That’s…a barrier? Moreover, several tens of them?) (Sakurai)<br/>
The only one who could do something like that is…<br/>
At the outskirts of the city, where the Sun Knight Order is stationed…at the deepest big tent there, I saw a mage in white robe floating in mid-air on top of it.<br/>
(Great Sage-sama!) (Sakurai)<br/>
She placed that barrier!<br/>
In that case…<br/>
I take a stance with my holy sword.<br/>
[Light Sword: Shining Saber]!<br/>
The second Taboo Dragon didn’t have the time to even raise a cry as it was cut down.<br/>
◇◇<br/>
-Takatsuki Makoto POV-<br/>
 "You bunch, listen well!! Tonight’s drinking party is one to celebrate the Light Hero who has splendidly defeated the legendary fiendish dragons!!" <br/>
Tonight’s Hero Bar is more crowded than usual.<br/>
"Tonight’s drinks will be on Highland. Everyone, be grateful to Princess Noel!" <br/>
""""UOOOOOOOHH!!""""<br/>
In this spacious beer garden, a special event was being held, and the highland knights and nobles were gathered.<br/>
I can see Sakurai-kun and Yokoyama-san too.<br/>
Or more like, they are the spotlight of this event.<br/>
"Hooray to the Light Hero!" "Sun Knight Order, hooray!" "Sakurai-sama~, look over here~!" "Hold me!" "The Sun Knights are also dreamy!" <br/>
Cheers were flying about.<br/>
"Man, it is quite the ruckus, huh." (Fujiwara)<br/>
"Let’s have a party of our own." (Makoto)<br/>
We were at a slightly luxurious table that Fuji-yan and Nina-san reserved, and there was a lot of food and drinks lined up.<br/>
After Sakurai-kun defeated the Taboo Dragons, I regrouped with Lucy and Nina-san.<br/>
Lucy went: What was that?! You can even use Monarch Magic, Makoto?!" and pressed me for answers.<br/>
She also muttered: "My identity…", but you simply have the Monarch Magic skill, but can’t use Monarch Magic though.<br/>
There were a lot of injured within the Sun Knight Order, but with the help of the Adventurer Guild, they managed to safely get out of the dungeon.<br/>
The monsters of Laberintos calmed down, and the Labyrinth City regained peace.<br/>
And so, it connects to the current banquet.<br/>
"By the way, who is the one doing the speech?" (Makoto)<br/>
It is not someone from the Adventurer Guild, and it doesn’t feel like he is a merchant.<br/>
"That’s a noble of Highland. Was it the Prime Minister’s Counsellor, Goshujin-sama?" (Nina)<br/>
"Yeah. One of the people in the Prince Faction, and it was apparently planned to have him notify the Kingdom when Sakurai-dono failed, but with the plans going down, he is doing this kind of job now." (Fujiwara)<br/>
Fuji-yan says this with an evil laugh.<br/>
He really knows everything.<br/>
"But Makoto also helped out in the subjugation of the Taboo Dragon. I don’t like that the whole achievement is being taken away by the Sun Knight Order." (Lucy)<br/>
"That’s not really the case-desu zo. Sakurai-dono has told the Adventurer Guild about his participation. The Guild should be contacting Takki-dono eventually." (Fujiwara)<br/>
"Why do you get that information faster than me?" (Makoto)<br/>
I retort while munching on fried chicken and ale.<br/>
"Well, I am not the main lead of this place after all", is what I said as I hit the shoulder of my classmate as I eat.<br/>
Sa-san turned around with meat in her mouth and wine on hand.<br/>
She eats a lot and drinks a lot.<br/>
Even though she has a small body.<br/>
"Sa-san, congratulations on subjugating the Harpy Queen." (Makoto)<br/>
"It was thanks to everyone…especially Takatsuki-kun." (Aya)<br/>
"That’s not true." (Makoto)<br/>
"But if I hadn’t met Takatsuki-kun in the dungeon, I…" (Aya)<br/>
Sa-san wrapped her arms around my arm and waist.<br/>
What is it? Does it have to do with being a lamia? <br/>
Or maybe she is simply drunk?<br/>
"Wait wait! You are way too close to Makoto!" (Lucy)<br/>
"Not really. It has been like this since long ago. Isn’t that right, Takatsuki-kun?" (Aya)<br/>
Was it?<br/>
"So, what will you be doing from now on, Aya?" (Lucy)<br/>
"Now that you mention it, the sister that betrayed the Lamias is still out there somewhere, right?" (Makoto)<br/>
If Sa-san is going to be exploring the dungeon, I plan on tagging along.<br/>
"About that, she is probably not here anymore. Honestly speaking, Laberintos is way too harsh of an environment for a lone lamia to live in." (Aya)<br/>
According to Sa-san, there’s way too many human adventurers at the Upper Floor, and the Mid Floor is too rough for a lamia to live in, so maybe she ran away somewhere else. <br/>
"Takatsuki-kun, you will be going back to this city called Makkaren, right? Is it okay for me to go with you?" (Aya)<br/>
"Of course—" (Makoto)<br/>
"Obviously! We are a party!" (Lucy)<br/>
Lucy said it before me.<br/>
How manly.<br/>
"Looking forward to working with you, Sa-san." (Makoto)<br/>
"Takki-dono~, I am also in that party, right~?" (Fujiwara)<br/>
"Goshujin-sama, Goshujin-sama, it is rare to see you drunk." (Nina)<br/>
According to Nina-san, Fuji-yan was really worried while staying back on his own.<br/>
"Oi oi, Fuji-yan, we are partners." (Makoto)<br/>
"Ooh! Partners! That sounds nice!" (Fujiwara)<br/>
"You really get along well as always." (Aya)<br/>
Sa-san laughs.<br/>
"By the way, how did the Light Hero-sama defeat the Taboo Dragon? You saw that up-close right, Makoto?" (Lucy)<br/>
"Yeah, his sword shone, and then the monster was minced up in an instant." (Makoto)<br/>
"Be a bit more detailed…" (Lucy)<br/>
"Ah, this pasta is tasty." (Aya)<br/>
"S-Sasaki-sama, that’s a big plate. You should be taking your share into your own plate to eat." (Nina)<br/>
When we were getting decently lively.<br/>
The big shot of the Sun Country from before shouted in a loud voice.<br/>
"Adventurer of Makkaren, Takatsuki Makoto. Be honored, Princess Noel has words of gratitude to express to you. You are allowed to come forth!" <br/>
The adventurers of the Labyrinth City all turned over here at the same time.<br/>
Eeh…this really cools down the alcohol in my system…<br/>
