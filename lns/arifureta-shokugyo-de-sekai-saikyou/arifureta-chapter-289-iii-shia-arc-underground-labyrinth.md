Arifureta After III   Shia Arc   Underground Labyrinth<br/>
<br/>
「No, this really is Indi○na huh.」<br/>
「Or perhaps, this is The M○mmy or To○b Raider isn’t it.」<br/>
That was their impression of the gruesome death of the person in front of their gaze. From the point of view of the people who had the experience of repeated adventures in another world, they had already seen even more gruesome deaths; so perhaps it could only be said that their reaction couldn’t be helped.<br/>
「Even so, there should be nothing inside those ruins though……」<br/>
Below, people were gathering around the man who had died while his face melted and yells began flying around. Hajime dubiously whispered while watching that.<br/>
「Did we fail to notice it?」<br/>
「Let’s confirm it now.」<br/>
*rustle rustle*, the familiar figures of the jack-of-all-trades Arachne-san became a regular appearance. One of the Arachne-san swung its leg as though to say 「You bastards! It’s time for workkk!」 before leading all the other Arachne ahead.<br/>
Their figures simultaneously heading to the ground by grappling on string looked like the rappel of a special army unit.<br/>
Shia was watching that sight with an expression like 「As expected they really have a will, don’t they? But as expected it’s scary, so I can’t ask!」 while beside her Hajime took out his smartphone.<br/>
It was a hybrid smartphone that combined modern technology with the crystal display made in another world. Basically, the smartphones of Hajime and co were all of hybrid make. It could contact another world, display statuses, fire lasers of concentrated super small sunlight with the thickness of a needle; anyway, it was multifunctional.<br/>
Right now, one of its functions, the function of sight sharing with Arachne, was activated. At the same time, the screen was a bit small to be watched together with Shia, so the hologram function (midair display) that was created from Earth’s programming technology, another world’s magic (space magic and so on), and special ore-like distant penetration stone, etc. was activated.<br/>
In the air before the eyes of Hajime and Shia, the field of vision of Arachne-leader was projected from the smartphone three-dimensionally. At the corner of the main projection, there were also small reflections lining up in a vertical line. Those were the field of visions of all the other Arachne.<br/>
「Yosh, there is no problem with the vision linking. Erst up to Funfte go toward the ruins. Sechste up to Neunte, head inside the surrounding tents.」<br/>
Hajime, who sounded like he was giving out instructions to the Arachne, caused Shia to crack her neck while putting up some spirit 「Yo~sh, I’m going to put in tsukkomi nooww~」.<br/>
「Hajime-san Hajime-san. Hajime-san is controlling all the Arachne-san, aren’t you!? Why are you making them salute like "Rogeer!" while following your orders!? As I thought, they have their own wills, don’t they!? It’s true, isn’t it!?」<br/>
Hajime showed a doubtful expression as though saying ‘This bunny, just what is she spewing on about?’. Shia was irritated.<br/>
「Don’t say scary things like that, Shia. They aren’t Myuu’s golem squadron. There is no way they have a will or anything, right? I just programmed them to act to some degree when they receive voice input. They are golems, but I’m also equipping them with Earth’s robot technology, you know?」<br/>
「……That salute is also included in that?」<br/>
「Yeah. After all, I use Arachne a lot for situations that demand secrecy. I put in the program based on the reference from the action pattern of special squads, but I’ve gone through that much trouble, so putting in a salute movement while I’m at it should be okay, right?」<br/>
If that was the case, then it wasn’t strange……was it? Shia’s rabbit ears dropped down powerlessly.<br/>
When she glanced at the display, she caught sight of the Arachne bunch skillfully raising two of their legs and doing reactions as though expressing 「Good griefyare yare」.<br/>
「Their performance is really detailed, isn’t it. Is that also an action pattern that is inserted into them?」<br/>
「Hm? Which one?」<br/>
Hajime returned his gaze from Shia toward the display. All the Arachne-san had already resumed their actions in order to accomplish their work.<br/>
「No, that’s why I said, it’s their movement of shrugging their shoulders as though saying "good grief this girlyare yare daze".」<br/>
「That’s why I’m telling you, Shia, stop that. Do you want to scare me? There is no way they can move like that when I’m not giving them instructions, right?」<br/>
「……」<br/>
Shia stiffened still. Her rabbit ears were shuddering while standing on end. Shia wanted to insist 「The one who is scared is me desuu! As I thought, those Arachne-san, they are possessed by something for sureee!」, but it didn’t seem like it wouldn’t be just merely a snake that would come out if she poked the bush.<br/>
And so, 「After this, I’ll consult with Myuu-chan, let’s do that」 Shia swore inside her heart while she made a tsukkomi at another matter.<br/>
「Cough-. Then one more thing. Did Hajime-san name those Arachne-san?」<br/>
「More or less. It will be more convenient in various things if they have individual names, right?」<br/>
「Their names sound terribly familiar for me though.」<br/>
The platinum apostles flashed in the back of her mind — the people who Shia worked hard to beat to death.<br/>
Hajime grinned widely,<br/>
「Great name, right?」<br/>
He said such a thing. It really sounded like sarcasm. The names of the opponents who she once carried out mortal combat with were used to name subordinate golems……<br/>
「If the people of Tortus heard it; then it’d easily be something that they would yell "Accursed thing!" at……」<br/>
「The civilians don’t know things as far as the names of the apostles, so it’s fine. In the first place, Shia, try looking at Japan’s literary work. Whether it’s god or devil, they are toyed around with a lot just as anyone liked in their work don’t you see. Even things like erogeerotic game won’t blink an eye to do it. Like a certain archangel, just how much terrible experiences did that angel meet in the past……」<br/>
「Can you stop talking about eroge in front of your lover!? Besides, I think that Japanese people’s karma is just too deep desuu!」<br/>
「I cannot deny that, huh. Recently, anything will get turned into a story character, and even after that, it will be anything goes for them following where the creator’s heart is going. But, I’m proud from the bottom of my heart toward such people in that business.」<br/>
Hajime said such a thing with a serious and tense expression. Toward such Hajime, Shia thought 「This person, no, rather Japan is totally no good. There is no saving them anymore desuu」 while holding her rabbit ears. She wanted to see the face of the parents who raised such a son. Although, the parents were a manga artist and a game company president. The father was in the middle of diligently producing a new eroge!<br/>
While they were making such stupid talk, the group of Arachne who were given the name of god’s apostles accomplished the infiltration into their respective targets safely.<br/>
Hajime put his finger on a midair display and slid it to the center in order to make the vision of Sechste, who infiltrated the nearest tent, as the main screen. The screen could be directly controlled with by the concept of a touch panel.<br/>
Sechste was sticking on the ceiling through the tent’s framework, using a bird’s eye view to overlook the whole tent.<br/>
「This is……how should I say it, my heart is fluttering.」<br/>
「Isn’t that right! My heart is drumming fast here!」<br/>
What was displayed in the midair display was a single room that was covered with transparent curtains and people wearing protective outfits who seemed to be researchers. No matter how they looked at it, it was a sterilized room, or perhaps a quarantine room.<br/>
Those factors that didn’t suit the facility of a ruin investigation caused the eyes of the two to sparkle with curiosity.<br/>
The image from Siebte and others who also accomplished their infiltration into other tents didn’t project only the image of excavation equipment. There were also a lot of things like some kind of measurement devices and sensor equipment.<br/>
One of the Arachne circled around to the back of Wilford.<br/>
Wilford was investigating the condition of the melted man. He then gave some kind of new instruction and persuaded the scared locals to make them return to their work. Perhaps because of that he looked a bit tired and shrugged his shoulders in exasperation. It seemed that he kept making an exaggerated gesture like a drama even when no one was looking.<br/>
The Arachne who stuck on his shoulder without getting noticed then……<br/>
「Hajime-san. This Arachne-san, it’s mimicking the movements of Luffy-san and pointing using its leg see. Ah, this time it’s putting two legs on its mouth while twitching. I can hear the voice of its heart saying "You saw the reaction just now? Laame~~e! Gi~ggle giggle".」<br/>
「Eh, strange. This guy……Neunte, you again. Come on, Neunte! Work properly! Don’t make strange movements! Okay, movement check! Lift upper right! Lift upper left! Don’t lower your right, lower your left! Ah, oi! Don’t lower your right! What are you doing lowering it along with the left! Is the voice recognition blurred?」<br/>
「……Somehow, Neunte and Erst are coming to mind though. Being able to see them following Hajime-san’s order and playing the raising the flag game is really surreal.」<br/>
The god’s apostles expressionlessly raising and lowering their hands. Sometimes they made mistakes and became flustered.<br/>
Certainly, it was a terribly surreal sight.<br/>
By the way, Shia was calling Wilford as Luffy because, in the end, the two were unable to recall his correct name, and as the result of the two of them complementing each other’s memory, they decided that the guy’s name sounded like Luffy! And so they called him that. The self-proclaimed businessman Wilford-san might be aiming to become a pirate king before long like this.<br/>
「Leave alone Neunte. What about Erst?」<br/>
They switched the screen to the vision of Erst who was at the main objective. The timing was just right when Erst arrived at the room where a lot of workers were gathering. It stuck to the corner of the ceiling and took an overhead view.<br/>
「They are digging a hole. What’s more, they are really going all out.」<br/>
「Looks like it. There might be something underground. Zweite. Go right above them.」<br/>
Hajime kept Erst’s overhead view in position while he gave instructions to Zweite to take the recording from right above the hole. Shia showed a deeply emotional feeling thinking 「Aa, that person who I shaved to death using the 100-ton hammer + drill」.<br/>
「This thing……it seems, there really is a path going underground.」<br/>
「Path……is it? It looks like a rectangle well though?」<br/>
「No, try looking closer. There, look.」<br/>
Saying that Hajime magnified the image while pointing.<br/>
Inside the image, a rectangle hole was projected. It was so big that there would still be some space left even if a lot of men were lining up inside it. The rectangular hole was hardened with stone on its four sides, stretching out straight below.<br/>
Indeed, it was just as Shia said, at a glance, it was more fitting to call it a "well" rather than a "path".<br/>
But, if one looked closer at where Hajime’s finger was pointing at, a protrusion like a ladder was jutting out at regular intervals from the stone wall. Furthermore, something like a tube that was giving out some kind of white smoke was sticking out.<br/>
「You will get it if you look at that tube’s surroundings. The man whose face melted just now was most likely from when he was in the middle of going down that ladder, and the acid or something flying out from that tube got him. Don’t you think it’s really dangerous for just a well?」<br/>
「Certainly, after all, it might enter the water for daily use if that’s a well.」<br/>
In other words, it was a vertical route leading underground.<br/>
What’s more, the word "secret" was attached to it. Around that vertical path, the stone floor was destroyed by heavy machinery, and the soil beneath it was dug up, and wreckage was scattered around. From that condition, there must be no mistake of this conclusion.<br/>
And then, looking from how even now there were the figures of locals excavating the vertical path up to around five meters below, it could be seen how that path was completely buried with rock and soil. And fairly severely at that.<br/>
「Putting aside the floor and stone, there were quite a lot of stones covered with soil. What’s more, they are manufactured to be like that to a certain degree.」<br/>
「In other words……」<br/>
「The path wasn’t buried naturally. It was intentionally blocked by covering it with several layers of soil and huge processed stones.」<br/>
When Hajime said 「This thing is looking more and more like India○-san huh!」, Shia went 「No no, if I have to say which this is, then this must be Ra○der-san you know, surely! Ah, but, an ancient mummy just like in The Mu○my! That possibility cannot be dismissed yet!」 Their tension was rising.<br/>
「Now then, Shia-san, what to do yah.」<br/>
「Of course, we are going to expose the secret sleeping underground, Hajime-san yah.」<br/>
Hajime and Shia chuckled ‘fu-fu-fu’ suspiciously while facing each other. It seemed they couldn’t help but feel their heart fluttering from encountering an ancient secret in their travels.<br/>
「Suppressing these guys and then asking them just what kind of information they have is the fastest way, but……」<br/>
「I am in the faction of conquering a game without looking at the strategy guide desu.」<br/>
「An adventure has to be like that I guess. My transmutation magic will shine here. Let’s slip underground using a different route from them and pay our respects to the ancient secret faster than them.」<br/>
This was an excavation team that spent money on this enterprise. They also had special equipment and machinery. In that case, this wasn’t a simple academic investigation. Ahead there should be a profit that would worth the investment for sure — a profit in the form of treasure.<br/>
「Hajime-san Hajime-san. Let’s do that. Leaving behind a message, just like a phantom thief!」<br/>
「That’s good idea! "We will receive the treasure first――」<br/>
「――by demon king and rabbit" isn’t it!」<br/>
The demon king-sama and the bug rabbit-san of the forest bumped their fist while going ‘yaa~y’ with their motivation going through the roof.<br/>
Both of them kept their presence hidden while jumping down from the tree. Then they turned back inside the thick forest where the armed guards couldn’t see them at all.<br/>
Shia’s rabbit ears were swooshing-swooshing around 「Quu-iick! Quu-iick!」 while she was frolicking around. Hajime sent a glance at her before he activated transmutation magic while smiling.<br/>
While the crimson sparks surged vividly, a large hole that the two could enter in easily even if they walked side by side was opening. Furthermore, it was stair-shaped. In addition, so that there wouldn’t be even the slightest chance for the soil to collapse, the surrounding was thoroughly reinforced with metal plates.<br/>
They then went down the stairs into the underground while continuing the transmutation. It didn’t even take ten seconds for their figures to vanish completely from view.<br/>
「For now, when we reach the depth of around 8 meters, how about we try connecting the path to that vertical path from the side?」<br/>
Hajime confirmed the angle of the path and transmuted a cave aiming at the depth that had been dug up to this point plus three meters. He didn’t make any changes to the ground, but he transmuted the wall and ceiling into metal plates while setting chemical lights along the wall.<br/>
Of course, Hajime had "Night Vision", and Shia was also a beastman, so her night vision was on the effective side. In addition, she possessed super excellent rabbit ears that could grasp the space three-dimensionally to a certain degree from the echo of footsteps even inside complete darkness, so they wouldn’t be that troubled even without lighting.<br/>
Having said that, being inside total darkness would depress the mood by quite a bit. In fact, their feeling was eased to some extent by the green light illuminating the underground path.<br/>
As though to express such a feeling, the path that was illuminated by the green chemical lights looked like the Orcus Great Labyrinth. The two of them looked at each other and smiled.<br/>
The smartphone was showing the position of Erst that was left behind on the surface, so without any mistake in the angle, the underground passage collided into a stone wall before long. A subtle vibration was transmitted through it, so without a doubt, right above them was the vertical passage that was being worked on.<br/>
Surely, the people above there would never imagine even in their wildest dream that there were already people right below the passage that they were desperately digging while trembling with fear from the risk of the melting liquid trap flying at them at any moment.<br/>
「We are going to follow alongside the vertical passage downward just like this.」<br/>
「I wonder how deep this passage is going to continue.」<br/>
A spiral staircase was created vertically alongside the stone wall.<br/>
While digging down deep underground, midway through, there were devices set up along the wall everywhere. There wasn’t just melting liquid, but gadgets that fired short arrows, mechanisms that thrust out spears, a set-up of rotating swords came flying, etc, etc……<br/>
It would be pitiful if the number of locals that had been sacrificed increased, so Hajime casually destroyed them. ‘What a consideration that is really like the Japanese people’, was the praise that Hajime sang in his heart.<br/>
Most likely, there were other traps on surfaces other than the wall. If he was a person who really thought about the locals, he would destroy all of them, but……Hajime-san ignored that aspect.<br/>
Before long, they dug down up to a depth that felt really deep, and around the time they were thinking about just when this vertical path would end, they finally reached stone pavement under their feet.<br/>
「……So deep.」<br/>
「From the bodily sensation, it feels like it’s around forty meters deep.」<br/>
「Measuring our distance with Erst……it’s a total of 43 meters. If the height of the ceiling is excluded, then certainly it’s around 40 meters.」<br/>
Hajime measured the distance using his smartphone while transmuting the stone pavement under his feet. Under the opened hole, darkness spread like a gaping open mouth. A really indescribable smell stabbed the nose.<br/>
Based on what he could confirm using "Night Vision", he couldn’t see anything really strange. Hajime looked at Shia, but her rabbit ears weren’t particularly reacting.<br/>
Just in case, Hajime tried dropping a chemical light. It raised a *clong* sound at about three meters below and rolled, but there was nothing around the light. He could only see stone pavement. There was nothing reacting at all.<br/>
Hajime and Shia nodded at each other and leapt down to the underground space.<br/>
And then……<br/>
A sound rang from below Shia’s feet.<br/>
*Gakon-* It sounded.<br/>
It was a strangely nostalgic ominous sound.<br/>
The stone floor sank down slightly. Shia tilted her rabbit ears saying 「Eh?」. At that moment, spears jutted out from the wall at the side!<br/>
「Hyowa!?」<br/>
「Nuwah!?」<br/>
Shia bent backward to dodge the spears. Hajime, who was right behind her, unusually raised a small scream and caught a spear. The spear tip stopped right before his right eye. It was relatively close.<br/>
「Shia, why did you dodge, huh? I thought you are going to catch or hit them down, so I got a bit surprised there.」<br/>
「So, sorry. Somehow I was reminded of the past, and I reflexively dodged.」<br/>
「At Raisen huh……」<br/>
At Raisen’s Great Labyrinth, Shia once fell into a whole load of booby traps, and she evaded with desperation. It seemed that the memory of that time was resurrected inside her.<br/>
When they looked over the surroundings once more, the path that was made from stone stretched deep to the left and right. The passage was splendidly created with a width of five meters and a height of three meters. There was a metallic door on the wall, most likely if they passed through the vertical passage, they would come out from there.<br/>
Hajime got it. The trap just now, then this passage, certainly it was a vivid reminder of the Raisen’s Great Labyrinth.<br/>
「Even so……is this really an ancient ruin? If that’s the case, the stone making technology at that time really surpassed the imagination.」<br/>
「On the television or internet, theories like ‘the ancient civilization possessed advanced technology!’ often comes out though.」<br/>
Even though many years had passed to the degree that the stones had weathered, the trap was still working, and the underground passage was still properly remaining without caving in. Furthermore, the depth was forty meters. Certainly, "an ancient civilization that possessed advanced technology" that might be featured on television could be smelt here.<br/>
「And, which path we are going to take?」<br/>
「Let’s see……. Shia, how about trying to use "Assumption Future"? You are a diviner (lol), right? Isn’t it your role to show the future?」<br/>
「Please don’t add (lol) to someone’s vocation.」<br/>
「Because, your vocation is "MonkMartial Artist" no matter how you think about it, right? Or else "Asura" or "Martial Arts God"……or perhaps "Berserker"? At the very least, you ain’t a fortune teller showing the future who is living quietly deep inside the forest.」<br/>
If she kept silent, then her appearance would "fit" her vocation. Her faint bluish white hair, her beautiful features. If she would wear a shrine maiden outfit and lived quietly in a place like a shrine deep inside the forest, then she would really look like a mystical fortune teller that saw through the world.<br/>
Even by mistake, a person who used that ability only for battles like ‘Seeing through the opponent’s movement several seconds ahead of time and beating them to death by making the first move! A super warrior who is impossible to get ambushed by detecting every fatal surprise attack!’ couldn’t be called as "the forest’s honored fortune teller".<br/>
Shia averted her gaze. "Assumption Future", an ability that essentially was to see through the future by the assumption of "What happens if this option is picked?". She almost never used it, so she couldn’t really argue back though she objected just in case.<br/>
「But but, divination is my forte. My fortune-telling often hits the mark, and it’s popular among the girls, especially the girls in the class. They often consult me, you know?」<br/>
「The problem is that even though divination is your forte, you yourself don’t particularly like it or anything. Your hobby is martial arts and bike riding. ――Fortune telling? I can do any kind of variety, and it will come true with a high probability, but it’s not like it’s my hobby desu――right?」<br/>
「……」<br/>
Shia averted her gaze and rabbit ears. And then, as though evading that topic, she used "Assumption Future". What if they went to the right passage? In the case of the left passage? Like that.<br/>
Her rabbit ears were bobbing up and down *myon myon*.<br/>
「Mumuh, I’m getting it Hajime-san! No matter which way is totally filled a lot with traps!」<br/>
「……」<br/>
Hajime’s fixed staring stabbed her.<br/>
「Bu, but it’s fine! I don’t feel any danger! Because generally, I’ll pulverize them all right from the front!」<br/>
Hajime wordlessly took out a chemical light. And then, he held it so that it stood on the ground and released his finger. *Pote-* It fell toward the left passage.<br/>
「Yosh, let’s take the left. The light pointed to the left. It’s a good omen.」<br/>
「……Just what in the world was I, who consumed a vast amount of magic power to divine the future, doing……」<br/>
Behind Hajime, who quickly advanced to the left passage, Shia was following him while directing a sad gaze.<br/>
A few hours after that.<br/>
Just like Shia’s divination, the two of them met a storm of traps.<br/>
――Countless spears stabbing out from the ground<br/>
Shia blasted them all together with the ground using tremor step.<br/>
――Melting liquid sprayed in a misty shape from the wall<br/>
Shia blew it away with fist pressure.<br/>
――The hanged ceiling fell<br/>
Shia pulverized it with Shouryuu○ that pierced the sky.<br/>
――A pitfall trap with a line of spears set up below<br/>
By using metamorphosis magic "Steel Clothes", she destroyed the spears.<br/>
※Shia’s metamorphosis magic "Steel Clothes" : Just like Tio’s "Dragonification", it was a technique that morphed a part of her body into steel. It made its first appearance during the main story’s last arc chapter 「The Young Girl With Rabbit Ears is Excelling」.<br/>
――Rolling giant rock<br/>
Nijuu ○ Kiwami! (TN: A fist technique from Rurouni Kenshin)<br/>
And then now……<br/>
*Ranranra~n♪* The passage that Shia was walking through with light footsteps had flames with a terrifying amount of heat jetting out from both sides of the walls and the ceiling.<br/>
At the entrance of the passage, Hajime was staring at Shia who was swallowed by flames with an expression that couldn’t say anything. Rather, he was even harboring sympathy to the creator of this underground space that was littered with traps.<br/>
「What a trifleee! Spirit defensee-!!」<br/>
Shia did something. Shockwaves ran in all directions and pushed the flames back. The walls and ceiling cracked, and the flame also stopped.<br/>
Naturally, let alone scald, Shia wasn’t even sooty.<br/>
「……Shia. What is spirit defense?」<br/>
「I created it using a certain muscle head bug character as a reference. A technique that uses spirit defense!」<br/>
Hajime thought. That ain’t explaining it at all.<br/>
Perhaps, it was the defensive technique, "Vajra" that Hajime used, which she learned using spirit?<br/>
While advancing forward, Hajime asked Shia with a twitching expression.<br/>
「Is there, any other technique you created using that certain bug character as a reference?」<br/>
「Of course there is! Next, I had finished learning Shia Impact and Eternal Shia Fever!」<br/>
「Serious, ly……」<br/>
Shia was radiant in this comedic exchange. Would something rush out from her whole body……? Thinking so, Hajime directed an expression that could be seen as trembling with fear toward Shia. At the same time, he hallucinated a vision of Shia turning into a brawny lump of muscles taking the most muscular pose.<br/>
Hajime went around and cut in front of Shia who was walking ahead in a good mood, and then he grabbed both her shoulders hard and pleaded from a very close distance.<br/>
「Shia, keep being as you are forever. Forever.」<br/>
「Ye, yes? What’s with you Hajime-san, so suddenly. Your eyes are so serious it’s scary though……」<br/>
Shia was somewhat creeped out. That was just how much Hajime was serious. He didn’t want to see a macho Shia!<br/>
「At any rate, this underground space, it’s wider than I thought. Geez, rather than calling it a space, it’s completely a labyrinth. The mountain of physical traps too, it’s seriously like Raisen’s Great Labyrinth.」<br/>
「It’s far better with no annoying comments coming out at all though~」<br/>
When thinking that under the vertical passage there was this space and a treasure was sleeping there beyond a doubt, then it could be considered that the main event was starting from there. The vertical passage seemed to be nothing more than the entrance into the underground labyrinth.<br/>
Around this time they became genuinely curious about the objective of Wilford and co.<br/>
「An amazing treasure might be sleeping here.」<br/>
「Is it treasures of gold and silver I wonder~. If we discover it, it feels like we are going to become the man of the hour isn’t it~」<br/>
They were chatting idly like that while crushing the mountain of booby traps that were highly filled with killing intent from the front (mainly by Shia) and advanced for a while.<br/>
Hajime suddenly 「Oh?」 leaked out a voice.<br/>
「What’s wrong?」<br/>
「The excavation work is halted. ……Looks like while we are being absorbed with the exploration here, around three more people become sacrifices. The locals are getting really scared. Luffy is saying something.」<br/>
Hajime gave instructions to Neunte to pick up the voice of Wilford.<br/>
「……Looks like he is making them stay by raising the compensation reward. Also, it looks like the lowering of their morale is really bad, and that today he is allowing everyone to rest.」<br/>
「How much has their progress advanced?」<br/>
「Around fifteen meters I think. It feels like they will reach the bottom just before noon tomorrow at the latest.」<br/>
「Come to think of it, the date has already changed to the next day. Fun times make it feels like the moment just flies away doesn’t it~」<br/>
The underground labyrinth that normally would produce dead victims in the dozens seemed to be no different than an attraction at an amusement park for the current Shia.<br/>
But, at that time, *kyuu~~~* such a sound rang out. Shia pushed on her stomach in a flash.<br/>
「Ehehe. I’m hungry.」<br/>
「Come to think of it, we didn’t take a dinner huh. We got too high spirited.」<br/>
Shia blushed shyly. Hajime warmly smiled while proposing a break.<br/>
「Those guys won’t be reaching the underground space until around tomorrow at noon anyway. Even at the fastest, it will be a few hours after the sun rises. They won’t catch up. Let us rest for today too.」<br/>
「Yee~s. Theenn, I will prepare the dinner quickly~」<br/>
The two of them picked a spot casually. Shia took out the "Anywhere System Kitchen" from her treasure warehouse and quickly began to cook. Beside her, Hajime took out a sofa bed and table set and endeavored in forming a pleasant space. Of course, he also didn’t forget to set up Sentori-senseisentry gun.<br/>
Like that, by the time Shia finished making dinner……<br/>
Well, how should it be said? The dreary ancient underground labyrinth that was overflowing with highly murderous traps was changed into a lovely space that was decorated by warm lantern light.<br/>
An antique table set, the sofa bed of the highest class, Sentori-sensei, and then a hearty beef stew that stirred up the appetite adorned the once empty passageway.<br/>
The technique of the artisan was shining there.<br/>
After saying ‘itadakimasu’, Hajime wolfed down the dinner greedily.<br/>
「Second.」<br/>
「Geez-, are you chewing properly? Beef stew isn’t a drink, you know?」<br/>
Even while saying that, it seemed that Shia was happy seeing Hajime engrossed in eating her cooking, so Shia’s expression was warm and loose. Her rabbit tail was fluttering around *furifuri*, and her rabbit ears were bobbing up and down *myo~n myo~n*.<br/>
Surely even the ancient people would never even have imagined it in their wildest dream. Even though they were making a "labyrinth that would absolutely kill the intruder", a sight of newly wedded spouses were developing there instead.<br/>
After that, they did things like harmoniously cleaning the plates side by side and clearing away the meal before falling sound asleep on the sofa bed while clinging closely to each other.<br/>
Next morning.<br/>
The excavation work had already resumed on the surface. By the time the work reached a point of just several meters above the underground space, the two sleepyheads finally woke up and aimed for the deepest part in a bit of a hurry.<br/>
They were able to reach their destination not too long after.<br/>
There, for the first time, the two discovered "that" which wasn’t an abnormal sight in this kind of place.<br/>
「Finally huh. All this time I had thought that it’s strange, but……」<br/>
What they found was a corpse that had already turned into a skeleton. There were also things like swords and armor all around. After looking at this labyrinth that was fully loaded with lethal traps, it wouldn’t be strange even if there were a lot more corpses lying around everywhere. It was also strange how they only found a corpse in the deepest part.<br/>
「It can also be seen as though it’s protecting that door.」<br/>
Just as Shia said, the corpse was found in the deepest part, lying down with its back leaning on the door. From its equipment too, at a glance, it gave off an impression that it was protecting the door to the death so no one would pass.<br/>
For the time being, aiming to check inside the door, Hajime avoided the corpse and put his hand on the door.<br/>
It was a large metallic door. It didn’t move even with Hajime’s physical strength. Thinking that perhaps it was a sliding door, he tried moving it aside, but as expected it didn’t move.<br/>
「Hajime-san, what is this depression here?」<br/>
「Hm? ……Keyhole, perhaps?」<br/>
「In that case, without a key normally no one can enter then.」<br/>
Shia ran her gaze at the spot around the corpse. But, she didn’t find anything that looked like a key.<br/>
「Can’t be helped. We already used a cheating technique to enter the underground space anyway, so we don’t need to search for a key or anything this late in the game.」<br/>
Hajime said that and put his hand on the metal door. Crimson sparks surged, and the door was changed into a mere ingot.<br/>
Hajime and Shia stepped inside the door that was forcefully opened.<br/>
「A corpse again huh……」<br/>
「It’s not silver and gold treasure is it? Ah, but, that corpse-san, it’s holding something.」<br/>
From its skeletal frame, it must be a female’s corpse. Inside the room that was around the size of six tatamis, a single skeletal corpse was lying down. They didn’t find any precious treasure, but rather it was a dreary room.<br/>
Therefore, the blackened metallic box that the corpse was holding stood out even more. It was as though a mother was embracing her child, especially with how the body was curled up embracing it like it was a precious treasure.<br/>
「This must be it. This is those guys’ objective.」<br/>
「Must be. Quickly, let’s take a look at the contents!」<br/>
*Waku wakuthrill, doki dokiexcitement*. It seemed that there was something really important inside.<br/>
But, no matter how tough the lid was, no matter how secure the seal was, as long as it was made from a mineral, it was meaningless against Hajime.<br/>
‘Now, I’m opening it’, Hajime used transmutation magic――<br/>
But just before he could.<br/>
「-!? Do, don’t, Hajime-san!!」<br/>
「!?」<br/>
Shia sent the metal box flying from Hajime’s hand. Her rabbit ears stood tensely on end, her eyes that were just recently shining with curiously was dyed in the color of vigilance.<br/>
「O, oi, Shia. Just what is it?」<br/>
「……That is, bad news. It activated after so long.」<br/>
Hajime guessed it from her words. At the same time, his vigilance jumped up to the highest level.<br/>
「You got a vision?」<br/>
Shia nodded briskly.<br/>
Since the legendary decisive battle, because there was no existence or phenomenon that was a threat to the bug character Shia, one of her abilities, the characteristic magic "Future Sight", hadn’t activated all this time.<br/>
It was the "vision of death" that would automatically activate regarding a future that was directly connected to Shia’s death.<br/>
In other words, the inside of that black metal box wasn’t anything like a precious treasure……<br/>
It was "something" that could possibly kill even the demon king and the bug rabbit.<br/>

※Joke explanation just in case for those who don’t get it.<br/>
<br/>
A certain lump of muscle bug character<br/>
<br/>
It’s Ja○ Rakan-san of Negi○. The character that Shirakome super liked. Volume 27 tightly grabbed my chuuni heart.<br/>
※Arifureta Nichijou’s latest chapter is updated!<br/>
The cuteness of stability and the amusement of toying with the main story.<br/>
Sometimes I’m doing reimportation of joke material lol (Like Shia-mama or macho Shia).<br/>
My overwhelming gratitude to Mori Misaki-sensei!<br/>
It can be seen from the homepage of Overlap-sama, so please go take a look without fail.<br/>
